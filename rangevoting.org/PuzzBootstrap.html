<H2> Answer to Puzzle #??: "Bootstrap" in statistics </H2>

<p><b>Puzzle</b><br>
In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)">bootstrap</a>
approach to statistics, you acquire some data set consisting of, say, N items of data,
and you want to compute some function F of the data. Your N-item sample is of course
extracted from a much larger universe, and whatever function you compute, will
only approximate the true all-universe value. One wants to understand how bad
that approximation is.  The question is: what is the probability 
distribution describing your post-data-analysis ignorance about F?
One "bootstrapping" approach to answer that is to compute
F on a ton on random M-element random subsets of your N-item sample, 
then declare/hope that this empirical
distribution is a good approximation to your ignorance about the unknown real one.
<br>
<b>Question:</b> What is the best choice of M?
</p>

<h3> An Answer </h3>

<p>
Suppose this is something like a pre-election poll and F is 
"the percentages of Kennedy, Nixon, and Wallace voters."
The number of Kennedy (or whoever) voters in your N-person random sample
can be regarded to good approximation as a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson</a>
random variable with mean=variance=vN
for some unknown constant v (which we would like to know) with 0&lt;v&lt;1.
The naive approximation of v is simply v&asymp;K/N,
where K is the number K of Kennedy voters in our sample.
If we take an M-person random subset of our sample, then the mean number of Kennedyists in the
subset will be MK/N, and the variance will be (1-K/N)MK/N.
Thus the ratio of (standard deviation)/(mean) originally was 
(vN)<sup>-1/2</sup> 
in the whole N-person sample, 
but in a random subset will be
[(N-K)/(KM)]<sup>1/2</sup>.
These two ratios are <i>equal</i> &ndash; which, I suppose, means the 
bootstrapped distribution is least distorted versus
the correct one &ndash; if, and only if,
M=(N-K)vN/K&asymp;N-K.  
This suggests that for the purpose of analysing a poll in a C-candidate race
(assuming this is genuinely a C-way race, i.e.
all C of the candidates are approximately equally popular)
it is best to use M&asymp;(1-1/C)N.
