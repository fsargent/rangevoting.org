Australian Minor Parties Don't Like IRV
</title>

<h2>
What do minor parties in Australia think about Instant Runoff Voting (since they actually
live in a country that uses it)?
</h2>
<p><small> By Clay Shentrup with some contribution by Warren D. Smith</small></p>

<p>
Contrary to the beliefs of many instant
runoff voting advocates in non-IRV countries, IRV produces two-party
domination.&nbsp; Minor parties in Australia are apparently well aware of this,
and want to get rid of it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In their Constitutional Reform Policy, the Australian Democratic Party states:<p 
style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">  In constitutional change, the Democrats will seek to provide for a bicameral parliamentary 
system with a House of Representatives and a Senate, <b>both elected by proportional representation</b> [which IRV is 
not], and 
responsible to the people.<br/>  <a href="http://democrats.org.au/policies/policy_dis.htm?id=5" title="SOURCE">SOURCE</a>

The web site of the Australian Green Party says:<br/> <p style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px"> The Australian Greens will:

On a call placed to the Australian Green
Party at 00 61 2 6162 0036, on 2006 November 2, the rep who answered said they
understand that IRV ("preferential voting", as they call it) promotes two-party
duopoly, and their objective is to get proportional representation in all levels
of government.
</li><br/>
<li>
The Official Australian Green Party <i>Platform</i> says
(item 17: democracy policy, platform version of early 2008):
"[The Greens will enact]
proportional representation in the House of Representatives
and local government."
Note that the House seats are exactly the federal
IRV positions in Australia.  The Greens thus want to change the system to
get rid of IRV for every federal government seat in Australia and replace them with 
<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a>
seats.  The Green platform also indicates they want that for non-federal IRV seats too.

The web site of the New Zealand Greens says:<br/><br/>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">
The New Zealand Greens will assist the Australian Greens in their drive to
introduce proportional representation into the House of Representatives 
[which currently uses IRV]...<br/>

A 2004 Detailed Policy from the Western
Australia Greens says:<br/>
<br/>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">
We need to review the voting system in the House of Representatives, and
consider implementing proportional representation, which provides a far better
representation of the views of the Australian public. This kind of reform has
been effective in New Zealand.<br/>

<h3> So what are they saying? </h3>
<p>
Are these third parties saying they want to get rid of IRV and replace it with a different
single-winner voting system such as <a href="Rangevoting.html">range voting</a>?
No.  These parties express few or no opinions about which single-winner
voting systems are superor and inferior, although they probably mostly believe that IRV is superior
to <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.
</p>
<p>
They are saying that they want to get rid of IRV (instant runoff voting) and replace it with
<i>multi</i>-winner PR elections.
</p>
<p>
Why?  Probably because all the Australian third parties keep 
<a href="AustralianPol.html">losing</a> IRV elections, whereas
they do win a small but significant fraction of PR seats. For example
(I am writing this in 2008) the Australian Greens, as Australia's largest third party,
have, in their entire history, won exactly one federal IRV seat.
This was the (Cunningham) House seat won by Michael K. Organ, who served 2 years (2002-2004).
The reason Organ managed to win this seat was that it was not a normal race consisting
of the NatLib candidate, the Labour candidate, and some third-party candidates.
In this particular race, there was no NatLib candidate.  The NatLibs in their
current <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">vote recommendation</a> recommend the Greens
above Labour.  Hence we expect that Organ in this election got most of the NatLib votes.
</p><p>
Similarly, as I write this in early 2008, the number of third-party-held Australian
federal IRV seats is
<i>zero.</i>
</p>

<a name="poll"></a>
<h3> Forget third parties &ndash; What about average Australian <i>Citizens</i>? </h3>

<p>
Perhaps stimulated by Britain's upcoming
national referendum to decide whether to switch to IRV
(the citizens of Britain rejected IRV by 68% to 32% margin on 5 May 2011),
in October 2010 a nationwide professional telephone 
<a href="assets/documents/AustraliaNewsPollVoteStudy.pdf">poll</a> of 1202 random Australian adults 
was conducted on (among other things) this same question.
(There was this difference, though: Britain already
was using <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting and the question was whether to switch to IRV;
whereas Australia was already using IRV which they call there 
"the alternative vote," and the question was whether to switch in
the opposite direction to plurality.)
The poll found that Australians would prefer plain-plurality voting 
versus the preferential (instant runoff) system they presently use to elect their House
if forced to choose one.
The poll's result was 57% to 37% (with 5% don't know/refuse).
</p>

<h3> Moral about IRV as a "stepping stone" to PR </h3>
<p>
Many believe that, despite <a href="IRVLetter.html">IRV's flaws</a>, 
it will serve as an intermediate step
toward <a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>, 
by which they typically mean Hare/Droop reweighted single
transferable vote (STV-PR).&nbsp; 
The reason they say that is that STV-PR resembles IRV voting (in fact the two are the same in
the single-winner case).
</p>
<p>
We say this is an unrealistic idea,
especially in a country like the USA.
</p><P>
<i>Why</i> is IRV an unrealistic stepping stone to PR?
Because IRV leads to 2-party domination.
It did so in Australia in IRV seats and Fiji (and Malta) and Ireland in IRV seats <i>despite</i>
the fact that Australia and Ireland <i>also</i> had strong third parties in non-IRV seats,
and despite other factors conducive to third parties (like non-presidential, multiethnic/lingual).
So in the USA, which lacks those third-party-genic factors, <i>for sure</i> there will
still be massive 2-party domination under IRV voting.
</p><p>
Now the top two parties who are enjoying
2-party domination, are not interested in switching to PR!  Many US cities
adopted STV-PR, most famously New York and Cincinnati, and every single one abandoned it
except for Cambridge MA.  The two major parties both made heavy propaganda and political efforts
to stop PR and those efforts succeeded.  They would need to make much less
impressive efforts to merely stop PR from being born, as opposed to stopping it once
it already was going strong.
So we can safely predict that, in the 2-party domination that IRV would continue to cause,
PR would not happen in the USA.
</p>
<p>
The "stepping stone" idea won't work.
</p>
<h3> Range voting as a better "stepping stone" to PR </h3>

<p>
A better idea:
Advocates of proportional representation, especially those
in minor parties (or "third" parties in the U.S.), should 
instead consider supporting <a href="RangeVoting.html" 
title="range voting">range voting</a> (RV), as an intermediate step to
<a href="RRV.html" title="reweighted range voting">reweighted range
voting</a> (RRV) or <a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>.&nbsp; 
These two PR voting systems are similar to range (indeed RRV and range voting
are the same thing in the single-winner case).  They both are simpler than STV-PR
and have better properties (for example "<a href="Monotone.html">monotonicity</a>").
</p>
<p>
There is good reason &ndash; both  <a href="WhyThirdRange.html">theoretical</a> and
based on <a href="PsEl04.html">real data</a> 
<a href="OrsayTable.html">2</a> 
&ndash;
to believe that range voting (unlike IRV) is likely to erode 2-party 
domination (probably gradually).  In all
range voting exit poll studies so far, the third parties got into the same
ballpark vote total as the major party candidates.
That contrasts with almost every IRV election held so far, where the third parties are usually 
hugely far behind both major party candidates.  
As a rough approximation, the best 1% of
historical performances
by third-party candidates under IRV, will be approximately the same as the typical third party
performance under range voting.
</p>
<p>
If reformers and third parties can bring about a switch to a better single-winner
election method, with the goal of eventually transitioning to proportional
representation, there's no telling how long that interim might be.&nbsp;
Considering that it could last <i>forever</i>, 
it would be greatly to their benefit to
choose the best single-winner system possible.&nbsp; In that case, the best
option would be to get range voting implemented first, and
<i>then</i> start working toward proportional representation.</p>
</p>
<p>
For those who object to the characterization of Australia's third parties as being "anti-IRV", when in fact many 
of their members say they support IRV <i>for single-winner elections</i>, there is a case to be made that they actually 
do <i>not</i> support IRV&mdash;they just <i>think</i> they do!&nbsp; 
That is, if they don't like being shut out of 
multi-seat posts by IRV, why would they want to be shut out 
of <i>single</i>-seat posts by IRV?!&nbsp; The problem 
is that there is a widely held false
belief that <i>no</i> voting method can prevent two-party domination in single-winner 
elections.&nbsp; This is <a href="EscapingDuopoly.html">false</a> &ndash;
<a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">history</a> has shown that (non-"instant")  
<a href="HonestRunoff.html">top-2 runoff</a> usually leads
to more than two powerful parties.&nbsp; It's reasonable to presume that if third parties
realized this, they wouldn't even support IRV for use in single-winner elections.
