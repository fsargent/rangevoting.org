<H3> Welcome to reality:  Meet the world's only actual data. </H3>

<p>
Here is the world's only actual data (as of 2005)
about range & approval voting vis-a-vis US third parties &ndash;
given in my paper
(#82  <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>)
coauthored with Doug Greene &amp; Jacqueline Quintal.
</p>

<p>
This is based on a pseudo-election
we conducted with real US voters (122 range voters
and 656 approval voters) 
simultaneously with the 2004 presidential election as an exit poll.

[Warning: last 2 columns are NY-state and Philadelphia suburbs only,
hence different sample than the "plur" column which is nationwide;
e.g. nationwide election was won by Bush, but Kerry won NY and PA state.
The "Total3rd" row is just the sum of Nader, Badnarik, Cobb, Peroutka, and Calero results &ndash;
which is admittedly somewhat meaningless &ndash; but anyhow
as you can see it actually would have exceeded Bush's total under range voting.
Please see the full paper if you want, e.g, statistical error bars, which are omitted here
for simplicity.]
</p>

<p>
As you can see, under range voting (RV) the third party candidates
<i>all</i> would have done a <i>lot</i> better than under
either
<a href="rangeVapp.html">approval voting</a> (AV) or
the current <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> (plur) system.
</p>

<p>
Warning: the data on Socialist Worker's Party candidate Calero is included with
some trepidation because there was not much data on him.
But as you can see what there was of it
also suggested that he would have gotten lots more range votes
than any other kind of votes.  It suggests that, while Calero got 17000 times
fewer plurality votes than Bush (and the ratio probably still would have been in the thousands 
even with Approval Voting)
Calero would have gotten about 1/10 as many votes as Bush under
Range Voting.  
Doesn't that seem more correctly representing what the US public really thinks?
</p>

<H3> Socialists are getting the shaft </H3>

<p>
Socialists are currently shut out of American politics.  
<a href="CorporateSlime.html">Rich fat cats
control the government</a> through their two handmaiden parties, and 
the rest of us are helpless to resist because the system is rigged so
that no other party can get anything because all vote counts
for third parties are  <i>hugely artificially lowered</i>
by the plurality voting system (as you can see from the data above, 
compare RV and plur columns to see the lowering under plur).
</p>

<p>
That isn't fair.  This is a rigged game.
</p>

<p>
And with the Democrat and Republican Corporocrats in total control,
they can and do continue to pull the levers of power to make the
rich get even more ridiculously richer off the backs
of the lower classes, who keep getting poorer and less powerful.
During 1983-1998 the bottom 40% of US households lost 76% of their wealth
whereas the wealth of the top 1% increased by 42%.
I mean, hello!  Does that strike you as a trend, or what?
</p>

<p>
The percentage of wage and salary workers who belong to labor unions decreased steadily
from a high  of 37.0% in 1960
to 12.9% in 2003 and still appears to be dropping
(US dept. of Labor, bureau of statistics).  Walmart deploys massive union-busting tactics
and there is not a peep of complaint about it from the government, or
the Democrats, or the Republicans.
</p>

<p>
About 12.5% of Americans and
20% of American children
(and 30-40% of black ones) live below the poverty line &ndash; worse than just about every country
in Europe &ndash; despite the fact the US often has
the highest GDP per capita of any country.  
(Median US incomes failed to rise in 2005 for the 5th straight year
[but <i>prices</i> kept rising... and the total size of the economy kept rising...]
according to the US Census Bureau the longest stretch of income stagnation on record.
[<i>New York Times</i>, 1 Sept. 2005, page A22, "Life in the bottom 80 percent".]
Do those things strike you as a little
off kilter?    
</p>

<p>
The total number of US citizens residing in jail currently exceeds, on both an absolute and
a per capita basis, that of any other country, no matter how repressive and totalitarian, 
making the USA not exactly the "land of freedom."
</p>

<p>
I could go on and on but you get the point.
</p>

<p>
Range voting is an important tool to make Socialism work because
Socialism is about the people making good collective government decisions.
And range voting is a far better procedure for doing that, because it
makes the decision the people
want, not the decision the big-money donors force the rest of us to accept.
</p>

<P>
With range voting, each voter expresses his opinion
about <i>all</i> the candidates, not just one, in
his vote &ndash; more information.  And 
unlike <a href="IncentToExagg.html">most other voting systems</a>,
with range voting that information tends to be <i>honest</i> information, because
while in most systems you are motivated to lie in your vote to make it
more strategically effective &ndash; e.g. to mis-state your "favorite" &ndash; with range
it is <i>never</i> strategically wise to mis-state your favorite.
More information per vote.  More-honest information too.
Result: better collective decisions, better democracy, better Socialism.

<H3> Third parties: Duverger's law says: enact range voting or die</H3>

<p>
The USA's  immense and permanent
2-party domination is a consequence of the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality voting system</a>
and <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's law</a>.
In any voting system in which Duverger's law holds (i.e.
plurality and <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting, see also 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">this</a> and
<a href="Why2Part.html">this</a>), third parties are
going to be permanent doormats.
And the rest of us consequently are going to suffer from massively reduced voter choice,
massive idea-deficit, and massive quality deficit in
our government.  Forever.
</P>

<p>
Incidentally, it is pretty damn interesting that the capitalist fat cats, 
when it is big TV revenue <i>money</i> at stake in the Olympics (gymnastic judging) employ range 
voting because if they employed plurality voting it'd be an outrage and it'd
cost them viewership.   <i>But</i> when it is our <i>government</i>, they find no need
to use a good voting system &ndash; what the heck, we'll just use one that leads to permanent
2-party domination.  Pretty damn interesting, don't you think?
</p>

<p> 
So in summary, the question for Socialists when they consider
"should we support range voting?" really is
"<b>do you like survival?</b>"  If you think survival is pretty important,
then range voting should be your <i>top</i> priority.  And I mean top.
More important than every single other issue.
</p>

<p>
So <a href="voldir/Volunteer.html">join CRV now</a> because it is <i>the</I>
group pushing for range voting.
