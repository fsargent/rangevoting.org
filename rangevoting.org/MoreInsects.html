<H2>More about social insects and their decision-making and evolution  </H2>

<p>
There are four main kinds of eusocial insects: 
<a href="AntParts.gif">ants</a>, 
<a href="TermiteTypes.gif">termites</a>, 
<a href="Polistes.jpg">wasps</a>, and 
<a href="ApisM.jpg">bees</a>.
The word "<i>eu</i>social" refers to an organization in which only one individual,
the "queen," performs the vast majority of all reproduction, while the
others perform non-reproductive duties.  The entire hive is thus a super-organism.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Asterisk:  bees depart slightly from the ideal of being a superorganism because not
all worker bees are forever sterile, and a 
very small percentage of the reproduction is done by workers.
If a fertile worker is caught laying eggs, she is killed and her eggs are eaten!
This kind of "policing" behavior could only have evolved if worker reproduction was once much
more common than it is now &ndash; so earlier bees were "less superorganismic."
</small>
</p>

<p>
Nest-relocation decisions are <i>not</i>
made by a large community in the ants, termites, and wasps:
instead the queen acting <i>alone</i> founds the new colony (albeit in the case
of termites, in collaboration with a single "king").  So in those cases there is
no need for "voting." <b>Only bees vote.</b>
</p>

<p><small>
<a href="LAlbipennis.html">NEWS FLASH!</a>
Sorry, that conclusion was premature.  It turns out certain ants also will
vote on a hive relocation decision if their original nest site is <i>damaged</i>.
(Might the same perhaps be true for other social insects?)  And amazingly, these
ants <i>also</i> appear to use <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
</small>
</p>

<p>
There are thousands of species of bees.  Most are not social.
The bumblebees are social but only in a comparatively small-scale way (maximum hive population
50-400 usually) and their new hives are started by a single queen acting alone &ndash;
just like ants and wasps &ndash; and last only 1 year.
</p>

<p>
There are two main types of sophisticated eusocial bees, which live in large hives with
tens of thousands of inhabitants and multiyear tenancy: 
the <i>honeybees</i> and the <i>stingless bees</I>.
The stingless bees appear older (a <i>trigona</i> worker
fossilized in amber was found that is 74-94 million years old) and are more diverse
(about 200 species known).  The honeybees (<i>apis</i>) seem younger
(oldest known fossil 22-25 million years old) and less speciated (about 10 species known).
The stingless bees were the only kind native in Australia and South America until 
humans introduced honeybees from Europe and Africa, 
and they now appear to be faring badly in competition with honeybees.
</p>

<p>
Note that the fact that those fossilized bees were sterile <i>worker</i> bees
strongly indicates they had already become eusocialized.  <i>Flowers</i>
appeared on the scene 120-140 million years ago.
Hence the (co)evolution
of modern eusocialized bees happened in 50 million years or less.
</p>

<p>
For economic reasons, the honeybees are much more studied than the stingless bees.
Honeybees produce much more honey, build quite different kinds of hives (involving wax 
honeycombs), are anatomically rather different (have stingers), and exhibit
considerably different behavior.  Honeybees communicate by a "dancing" sign language.
The stingless bees are also known to communicate (for at least some species), but do so
by olfactory or auditory means which have not yet been decoded
by humans.
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="ApisMellifera.html">Honeybee</a></b> 
hives "fission" into two, with the new "swarm" picking its new nest site
a considerable distance (typically several miles) away by means of a "scouting and voting"
collective decision-making process that is nowadays well understood, and is in fact
almost equivalent to the CRV's <a href="RangeVoting.html">recommended</a>
form of <a href="ApisMellifera.html">range voting</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once the honeybee swarm has left the old hive, it is a total divorce; they do not return.
The old queen moves to the new nest-site (and construction of the new nest by
the swarm's workers commences)
while new virgin queens fight to the death for control of the old nest.
</p>
<p>
The <b>stingless bees</b>, in contrast, build new hives fairly nearby, with the new hives
being occupied by a new virgin queen <i>after</i> its construction by workers.  
There is a great deal of interaction
between the new and old hives, including exchanged honey and materials, for a period
of several months.   The process of determining where to locate the new hive
also appears to be a collective one involving scouts eventually settling
on one choice, but the manner in which that consensus is reached is not
presently understood.  
</p>

<p>
<b>An open question:</b>
It is generally believed that the honeybees did <i>not</i> evolve from the stingless bees 
but rather independently from some other (asocial) bee type (and this speculation should
be provable from DNA evidence); and that any social features the
two now share are the result of <i>con</i>vergent rather than <i>di</i>vergent evolution.
If so, then the stingless eusocial bees are pretty much
an <i>independent</i> Darwinian experiment and
so it would be very interesting to understand what voting method the stingless bees independently
invented.  Is it also range voting?  Is it something else?  Is it a single-winner method
at all (or will stingless bees settle into <i>two</i> new homes with two new queens
generated for the occasion if both look good enough)?
