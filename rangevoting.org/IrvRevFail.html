<H2> IRV (Instant Runoff Voting) contradicts itself (best is worst?) and other disasters  </H2>

In this 24-voter <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> election,
<b>A wins</b> after the IRV process eliminates C.
But now
suppose every voter <i>reverses</i> her preference order (i.e. they are now
attempting to choose the worst candidate rather than the best).
In that case  <b>A</b> <i>still</i> wins after B is eliminated.
I.e. <i>IRV contradicts itself</i>; IRV's unambiguously
"best" candidate A is here
the same as its "worst"!  (Such embarrassing <b>winner=loser reversal failures</b> are, however,
never exhibited in 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>, 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>,
 Borda, 
<a href="RankedPairs.html">Tideman Ranked Pairs</a>,
or Schulze beatpath voting,
all of which are logically self-consistent in this respect.)
<!-- <A href="LoseAll.html">Plurality</a> voting can exhibit one form of reversal failure but
not another. -->
</p>
<p>
This failure is really just a mere symptom of the 
<a href="IrvLogicBogus.html">flawed logic</a>
underlying IRV.
</p>
<p>
This example also illustrates a bizarre kind of strategic voting.  Suppose
3 of the B>C>A voters reverse their votes to A>C>B.
In that case B is eliminated whereupon <b>C</b> wins 13-to-11 over A.
Incredibly, the reversal's raising of A from bottom-to-<i>top</i>
in their vote caused A to <i>lose</i> &ndash;
and voting maximally dishonestly as though they were suicidally
trying to elect the <i>worst</i>
candidate, was actually optimal strategy that
caused the election result to <i>improve</i> from their point of view.
(And that pathology happened in <a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, this election also illustrates a "no show paradox":
If those three B>C>A voters had simply <i>refused to vote</i>,
then C would have won, an improvement in their view.   Different way of saying the same thing:
these three voters' decision to cast an honest A-<i>last</i> vote
caused A to <i>win</i>. (Amazing, but true.)

The Ivars Peterson 
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20031018/mathtrek.asp">
piece</a> about "reversal failure" in <i>Science News</i>  (10/18/2003)
points out that <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda Voting</a>
can never suffer such a failure, but unfortunately failed
to observe that Range Voting <i>also</i> cannot.

In the 14-voter 4-candidate IRV election on the left, the <b>winner is A</b>
while the <b>last-place finisher is D</b> (knocked out in round 1).
</p><p>
However, if all ballots are reversed so that every voter expresses exactly the 
<i>opposite</i> opinion on everything, then
we get the election at right.  
You might think that now D would win and A finish last.
Wrong &ndash; that would be sane.   What the IRV system delivers is instead the psychotic
result that A <i>still</i> wins, while D <i>still</i> finishes last.

<p>
These examples also nicely lay to rest the silly <b>myth</b>
that IRV "always elects true-majority winners."
If you believe that myth, then you must believe that the true-majority
choice of the best candidate, is the same as the true-majority choice of the worst candidate.
We recommend not believing that myth.
