<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">Range Voting Bulletin Board</a>, 
or "Blog" </H2>

<p>
Joining the RV blog allows you to read, post, and text-search our messages, 
with <i>optional</i> email auto-delivery
to you.  Can withdraw at any time.  Can then participate in our polls, etc.  
Joining the Bulletin Board
resembles subscribing to a newspaper in that it does not signify your 
endorsement of anything.

page, then click "join" or "new user sign up" and follow subsequent instructions.
