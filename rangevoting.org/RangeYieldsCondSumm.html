<H2> Range Voting for Condorcetists </H2>

<p>
<b>1.</b> 
We argue that if the voters are all maximally honest, then range voting 
outperforms Condorcet voting methods.
</p>
<blockquote>
<small>
The classic over-simplified and
over-dramatized example is the "kill the Jews" vote where the choices are
<ol type="A">
<li>
Kill the Jews and steal their money, using it to reduce taxes for
non-Jews.
</li><li>
The Jews (who are a minority) live.
</li><li>
(Possibly other choices too.)
</li></ol>
With honest Condorcet voting (by which I mean, honestly indicating the
choice that is best solely for that voter, no matter how slightly),
A wins.
<br>
But with honest range voting if the voters honestly express weak preference for A
but strong preference for B 
(because the voters who benefit from reduced taxes wish to indicate honestly 
that is a small gain for them, while the Jews who die, wish honestly to indicate 
that is a large loss for them), B can win. 
B is better for society overall.
<br>
This example illustrates the fact that, <i>if</i> there is enough voter
honesty, range can deliver superior results than any other of
the usual voting method proposals.   No other commonly-proposed voting method can avoid
the "tyranny of the majority" problem.
(Although this example was
over-dramatized and over-simplified, scenarios like it do arise
all the time, e.g. as of 2009 the "Swiss minaret ban" and various referendums on banning "gay marriage" 
might be abstractly comparable.)   
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> simulation data backs this all up
by giving experimental proof Range yields superior results with honest voters.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>2.</b>
On the other hand, if the voters strategize, then
Range voting actually elects <a href="Glossary.html#condwin">Condorcet winners</a>
<i>more often</i> than 
Condorcet methods.  In other words, by exactly the yardstick Condorcet-supporters want,
range voting is superior to Condorcet methods!
</p>
<p>
<b>Q.</b> How can this be?  I thought the whole point of Condorcet voting
methods was that they <i>always</I>
elect a  Condorcet winner (whenever one exists)?!?
</p>
<p>
<b>A.</b> Yes, but not if the voters are strategic (i.e. dishonest).
</p>
<p>
<b>The model</b> we shall examine is the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We suppose honest voters elect candidate C who is (perhaps) a
Condorcet winner.
</li><li>
But that was just a pre-election poll, not the real election!
</li><li>
Now in the real election, the voters are assumed to strategize. Those
voters who are anti-C will therefore &quot;<a href="CondStratProb.html">bury</a>&quot;
C because (clearly,
as was just proven to them by the pre-election poll) honestly voting
is not good enough strategically for their purposes.
(Pro-C voters can try to counter by artificially raising C to top.)
Consequently, in the real election it sometimes will happen that C
will not be elected, even when C is the honest-votes Condorcet
winner, and even if we employ a Condorcet vote-counting method. 
How often does this happen? That is what computer simulations can tell us.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We can also do the same computer experiment with both the pre-election
polls and real election being held with some <i>other</i> voting system. 
We <a href="ReasAssump.html">tried</a>
plurality, range, approval, and IRV. In the real election,
we assume the voters exaggerate maximally on A and B &ndash; where A and B are the
top-two finishers in the pre-election poll &ndash; as a strategic move to maximize the 
impact of their vote.
</p>
<p>
It can be <a href="AppCW.html">proven</a> that in this model, Approval and Range voters
will always elect the Condorcet Winner (CW) [whenever a CW exists] <i>if</i>
the CW was one of the top-two finishers in the pre-election poll (and also sometimes
even if it was not).
We can, by computer, determine how often these things happen.
</p>
<p>
The result of the simulation study is 
that <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> leads to a probability
somewhere between <b>94% and 100%</b> of electing a Condorcet winner in the real
election (assuming 3-to-9 candidates run, and 
<a href="Glossary.html#REM">random election model</a>,
and restricting attention to elections in which a CW exists).
</p><P>
Plurality, IRV, and approval, however, all lead to substantially
lesser CW-election probabilities: <b>64 to 96%</b>
depending on number-of-candidates (3 to 9) and election method, and always less than for
range voting.
</p><p>
If you are a Condorcet fan, this range result ought to be highly
satisfactory to you. 
<small>
Frankly it seems like if you get a result this
close to your desires &ndash; 94% to 100% &ndash; you ought to quit whining!
</small>
</p><p>
But ok, you might not be completely satisfied and might still want to
get that additional 0-6% of potentially-available Condorcet winners.
</p><p>
So therefore, you might say "let's use a Condorcet method!".
However, the <a href="StratHonMix.html">computer simulations</a>
show that, in this same model,
all the Condorcet methods tried (and I tried a lot of them)
actually yield substantially <i>smaller</i> chance of electing a Condorcet
winner, than range voting.
</p><p>
Which leads you, as a Condorcet advocate, into difficulty.
Why are you advocating a <i>more complicated</i> voting method that is <I>less</i>
likely to lead to what you want (electing Condorcet winner)?
</p><p>
So then how are you going to escape from this quandary? Possible choices:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Cover your eyes, say you have a headache, and refuse to accept
or notice it.
</li><li>
Say that voters will not actually be strategic. They will be
honest. But in that case range voting is better than Condorcet
voting as we already saw (#1 at top).
</li><li>
Say that voters in the <i>pre-election poll</i> will not be honest, they
will be strategic. But the <a href="StratHonMix.html">simulations</a>
indicate that range, even with
50-50 mix of honest+strategic voters in the pre-election poll,
still leads to higher probability of electing a CW, than does
Condorcet even if Condorcet enjoys 100% honest voters in the
pre-election poll.
<br><br>
And even if in the pre-election poll the range voters are 100%
strategic, i.e. they are approval voters &ndash; the same simulations
<!-- /StratHonMix.html see 2nd table
Approvval2Runoff line... -->
indicate we get about 50%
more Condorcet winners than Condorcet methods yield,
even if the latter enjoy 100% voter honesty in the pre-election poll!
(And this all in in a sim-scenario intentionally chosen to try to make
range look bad!)
</li><li>
Decide you should <a href="Endorse.html">SUPPORT RANGE
VOTING</a> since it experimentally leads to more Condorcet winners and is simpler than
Condorcet voting. 
The former means range is better by the very
measure you, as a Condorcet advocate, claim most-matters. 
The latter means range is
more-adoptable and hence more likely to actually happen.
