 Nobel prizes and Democracy 
</h1>

<p>
Does democracy cause more top-quality science and literature?
To test the question,
we rank all countries by
Population / "Intellectual" Nobel Prize Ratio.
By "intellectual" we mean that the Peace Prizes are omitted.
Our tables include all Science and also the Literature prizes from the first year
(1901) they were awarded, up to and including 1999.
We have also included the Economics "Nobel" although Nobel himself did not endow an
Economics prize and it was created by a separate agency (the central Swedish bank)
in 1968 and is regarded with disdain by many scientists.
(And note there is no mathematics Nobel prize although the "Abel Prize" was established by the 
government of Norway in 2002.)
</p><p>
To be fairer to low-population countries,
we rank countries by the <i>ratio</i>
of number of prizes won divided by <i>population</i>.
Most of the population data (in thousands) are from the
<i>World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000</i> (for 1999) Mahwah, New Jersey:
PRIMEDIA Reference, 1999.
The Nobel Prize data was tallied from the
same source and also from
<A HREF="http://www.nobel.se/index.html">http://www.nobel.se/index.html</A>.
Almost all this data was gathered by 
<a href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQBasics.aspx">Rodrigo de la Jara</a>
for an entirely unrelated project about IQ; we have merely copied it.
There was sometimes more than one country
listed for a Nobel &ndash; then we gave <i>all</i> the
listed countries (full) credit.
I (Warren Smith) am simply using de la Jara's data without any attempt to check it.
[There is also what might be a better (?) Nobel-data compendium in Wikipedia
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_Laureates_by_Country">here</a>.
I haven't used it.]
The population data for the USSR is from their 1989 census (the last one conducted).

<h3>Color codes:</h3>
<p>
<b>Democracies</b> are white, but the three
<b>"<i>advanced-design</i> Democracies"</b> are light <font color="#0000ff">blue</font>.
<b>Non-Democracies</b> are colored <font color="#ff0000">red</font>.
Note, it is somewhat subjective what a "democracy" is.  
I fully admit I am using my subjective judgment, but subject to these principles:
<ol>
<li>
We try to coincide with
the general feeling <i>at that time</i> about whether that country was a democracy.
(See these <a href="DemocEnd.html">capsule histories</a> of countries.)
</li><li>
Further, some of the countries listed (e.g. Germany) were only democracies for <i>some</i> but not
others among their Nobels (which also brings in the somewhat-muddy
issue of just when and where 
each Nobel-worthy work was done...).  They are colored less-red the 
more-democratic they (roughly) were.
</li><li>
Some countries are or were "apartheid democracies" such as South Africa before the 1990s, 
Israel in 2000, and the USA
before the 1970s.
In these countries, there was a racial/ethno/religious underclass which did not
enjoy democratic representation and benefits, while an overclass did.
We have listed these countries as "democracies" because
their Nobelists were all from the overclass and thus <i>from their
point of view</i> were living in a democracy.
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>It seems quite clear</b> from this data that 
democracies produce more Nobelists per capita than non-democracies.
Possible <b>reasons:</b>  non-democracies tend to try to keep a tight rein on
unpredictable developments (that might conceivably lead to a disagreeable power-shift)
such as science and literature, and tend to prevent/control
free exchange of information and publication; meanwhile democracies tend to encourage those things.
It is hard to build long-term research facilities in an atmosphere of political instability,
and some non-democracies seem unstable.  (But some democracies also seem unstable, so that
would not necessarily have anything to do with it; but in fact all our top-ranking
countries have been quite-stable democracies.)
Perhaps people in non-democracies have incentive to "stay invisible"  and indistinguishable from
the crowds, which is incompatible with being a Nobelist.
Perhaps democracies tend to foster greater immigration and general migration of talented people,
which helps.  (Observe Japan has been comparatively unfriendly to immigrants,
and sure enough is doing quite poorly, Nobel-count-wise, versus other democrcies.)
Non-democracies when they <i>have</i> striven to advance science and technology have often done so
in <i>military</i> technology, which while it leads to advances, tend not to be the sort of
advances that garner Nobel prizes.  
Democracies tend to be richer countries, which helps.
Finally, perhaps the sort of mind that
produces Nobel-quality work has trouble doing it in a non-democratic milieu.
Actually I have no idea what the true reason or reasons are, those all were guesses.
But the <i>data</i> seems fairly clear, ignoring the reasons.

<h3> How statistically significant is this? </h3>

<p>
Well, looking only at the top 14 and bottom 14 among the 40 Nobel-winning countries,
if Nobelitude were totally unrelated to (or negatively-related to)
democracy then
what would be the chance that at most 2 in the top-14 would have any non-democraticness,
while meanwhile at most 4 in the bottom-14 would be democracies?
</p><p>
Answer (given that the 28 total countries are split 16+12) is 
</p>
<center>
[1+binomial(14,1)+binomial(14,2)] &middot;
[1+binomial(14,1)+binomial(14,2)+binomial(14,3)+binomial(14,4)]
/
binomial(28,16)
=
155926/30421755
&asymp;
0.0051
<!-- old calculation:
(1+14&times;binomial(14,3)+binomial(14,2)&times;binomial(14,4))/binomial(28,12) &le; 0.0032.
-->
</center>
<p>
That already would be 99.5%  statistical significance.
(<small>Above calculation redone October 2013. Earlier version had found 0.0032.</small>)
But if we also throw in the fact the three advanced-democracies in the world
are all in the top half, that's another juicy factor.
I could probably try harder to get stronger confidence estimates, but
haven't bothered.  (It might be interesting for somebody to do a careful analysis trying to
milk every last drop of statistical significance out of this data to see how confident we
<i>really</i> ought to be.  Our crude
analysis only gives a lower bound on confidence.)
So, in conclusion: even without trying very hard we can see with at least about
99.9% statistical
significance that democracy <i>is</i> positively-related to Nobel-prize rate.
