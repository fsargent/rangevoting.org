<H2> Florida Moves to End Touch-Screen Voting </h2>
<p>

Gov. Charlie Crist today announced plans
today to abandon the touch-screen voting machines that many of
Florida's largest counties installed after the disputed 2000
presidential election, instead adopting a statewide system of casting
paper ballots counted by scanning machines.
</p><p>
Voting experts said Florida's move, coupled with new federal voting
legislation expected this year, could largely signal the death knell
for the paperless electronic machines. If as expected the Florida
Legislature approves the $32 million cost of the change, in fact, it
will be the nation's biggest repudiation yet of touch-screen voting,
which was widely adopted after the 2000 recount as a state-of-the-art
means of restoring confidence that everyone's vote would count.
</p><p>
Several counties around the country, including Cuyahoga in Ohio and
Sarasota in Florida, have exchanged touch-screen machines for others
that provide a paper trail. But Florida could become the first state
that invested heavily in recent rush to touch screens to reject them
so sweepingly.
</p><p>
"Florida is like a synonym for election problems; it's the Bermuda
Triangle of elections," said Warren Stewart, policy director of
VoteTrust USA, a nonprofit group that has advocated optical scanners
as more reliable than touch screens. "For Florida to be clearly
contemplating moving away from touch screens to the greatest extent
possible is truly significant."
</p><p>
Other states that rushed to buy the touch screens are also starting to
move in that direction. Earlier this week, the Virginia state senate
passed a bill that would phase out the touch-screen machines as they
wear out and replace them with optical scanners. The Maryland
Legislature also seems determined to order a switch from the paperless
touch screens, although it is not clear yet whether it will require
the use of optical scanners or just allow paper printers to be added
to the touch screens.
</p><p>
And on Monday, Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, plans
to introduce a bill in Congress that would require all voting machines
nationwide to produce paper records through which voters can verify
that their ballots were recorded correctly. Mr. Holt's bill would also
substantially toughen the requirements for the touch-screen machines
that have printers, and experts say this also could give more impetus
to the shift toward the optical scanning systems.
</p><p>
Mr. Crist, a Republican, was at times drowned out by whoops and
applause when he announced his plan at a civic center in Palm Beach
County, the epicenter of the 2000 election standoff and home of the
infamous "butterfly ballot" that confused large numbers of voters. The
touch screens had replaced the punch-card systems that became infamous
that year.
</p><p>
"You should, when you go vote, be able to have a record of it," Mr.
Crist told a few hundred mostly older citizens at the South County
Civic Center in Delray Beach, where thousands of residents
accidentally voted for Patrick J. Buchanan in 2000 instead of Al Gore
because of the confusing ballot design. "That's all we're proposing
today. It's not very complicated; it is in fact common sense. Most
importantly, it is the right thing to do."
</p><p>
Mr. Crist's renunciation of touch-screen voting, just one month after
he replaced Jeb Bush as governor of the nation's fourth-largest state,
suggested that the fight for paper voting records, long a pet project
of Democrats, might now become more bipartisan. Mr. Crist made the
announcement with Robert Wexler, a Democratic congressman from Boca
Raton, who has ardently led the movement here and in Congress for a
paper voting record and has frequently attacked Republicans along the way.
</p><p>
"I support this plan 100 percent," Mr. Wexler said before introducing
Mr. Crist. "This governor means what he says, and he's coming to
Tallahassee and he's spreading the message throughout Florida that
this isn't about Republican or Democrat, it's not about this ideology
or that; it's about unifying people and doing what's right for the
people of Florida."
</p><p>
The 15 counties that adopted touch-screen voting in recent years,
including Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Hillsborough, would move
to optical-scan voting under the proposal before the presidential
election of 2008. The plan would, however, give them the option of
using touch-screen machines during the state's two-week early voting
period that precedes Election Day, if the machines are modified to
provide a paper trail. Those counties represent 54 percent of the
state's registered voters.
</p><p>
Mr. Crist said the county election supervisors would explore how to
make optical-scan voting easier for blind people and for those who
speak foreign languages. In some cases, they are able to vote without
assistance on the electronic touch-screen machines.
</p><p>
Asked how he felt about discarding tens of millions of dollars worth
of touch-screen machines just years after they were acquired, Mr.
Crist said: "The price of freedom is not cheap. The importance of a
democratic system of voting that we can trust, that we can have
confidence is, is incredibly important."
</p><p>
Election experts estimate that the paperless electronic machines were
used by about 30 percent of voters nationwide in the 2006 elections.
But the reliability of the machines has increasingly come under
scrutiny, as has the difficulty of conducting recounts without a paper
trail. Federal technology experts concluded late last year that
paperless touch-screen machines could not be secured from tampering.
</p><p>
Some states had bought early versions of the paperless machines before
the 2000 recount, and one of them, New Mexico, switched last year to
optical scanners. But most of the machines in other states were
purchased with federal money provided under a 2002 law that required
states to upgrade from old punch-card and lever systems.
</p><p>
A recent survey by Election Data Services, a Washington consulting
firm, estimated that 36 percent of the nation's counties have bought
electronic machines, including some with printers attached, while 56
percent have the optical scanning systems.
</p><p>
In New Jersey, Mr. Holt said his bill would require the return to
paper ballots by next year's presidential primaries, and it would
authorize $300 million in federal money to upgrade the machines. Some
state and county election officials say it could be difficult to make
such sweeping changes by then.
</p><p>
Mr. Holt challenged that assumption. "It depends on how badly we want
to do it," he said. "The public is getting very impatient here."
</p><p>
In Sarasota County, Fla., last November, more than 18,000 voters who
used touch-screen machines did not have their vote recorded in the
close Congressional race between Vern Buchanan, the Republican, and
Christine Jennings, the Democrat. Mr. Buchanan took office last month
after a recount gave him a 369-vote victory margin, but Ms. Jennings
has sued. Whether the problems were a result of poor ballot design or
machine malfunction remains a mystery.
</p><p>
Former Governor Bush, President Bush's younger brother, generally
defended touch-screen voting during his tenure and said skeptics had
fallen prey to "conspiracy theories." But while he vocally defended
touch-screen machines leading up to the 2004 presidential election,
the Republican Party of Florida sent out flyers urging voters to use
absentee ballots because state officials "do not have a paper ballot
to verify your vote."
</p><p>
Mr. Stewart, the critic from VoteTrust USA, said cost concerns also
helped fuel the shift to optical scanners, because fewer of the
machines will need to be purchased. But Kimball W. Brace, the
president of Election Data Services, said optical scanning systems
have had a slightly higher rate of voter error than the touch screen ones.
