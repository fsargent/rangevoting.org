<H2> Plurality with second round runoff </H2>

<p>
One old half-fix for Biggest Minority Rules is the two-round system where the top two 
vote-getters from the first round advance to the second round. Running a whole extra round of 
voting is expensive;
turnout often drops; and sometimes the wrong two advance. 
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">France</a> saw this problem in their 2002 elections. 
The nation reacted in horror when a very split vote led to a neo-fascist advancing to the 
second round &ndash;
only to prove what everyone knew, that he had no broad support. 
Under <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>, he would never have made it into the top two.
