<H2> Governmental "Stability" vis-vis range voting </H2>

<p>
(Under construction!!)
</p>

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
One of the most common dismissals of range voting is that &quot;first-past the post
(aka <a href="Plurality.html">plurality voting</a>) lends itself to
stability&quot;.  This is difficult to counter; because it <i>does</i> lead to
stable <i>party structures</i>, which in fact CRV's analysis shows, and
countries with proportional or range voting systems generally haven't been
around long enough to show decisive advantages.
</p>

<p>
<b>A.</b>
This is a tough question which requires thought and research to answer...
I.e: what is "stability"? How do we measure it?
Is it desirable? And what would Range or Approval Voting do to it?
None of these 4 subquestions seems to me to have any immediately clear
answer... and it really is more than 4 since many more than 1 kind of stability
could be considered...
</p>

<p>
<b>One partial stab at an answer:</b>
If we have plurality elections, then via <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's law</a>
we get a 2-party system which is
"stable" in the sense that
other parties automatically die out.   This causes a certain natural polarization.
</p>
<p>
If gerrymandering is allowed (as it is in the USA) and campaign
contributions to those
in office (even those without opponents) is allowed (as it also is in the USA)
then the result can be <a href="OneParty.html">1-party domination</a>
where the other party is
undemocratically gerrymandered and campaign-contributed out of existence.
This is since campaign contributors
love to contribute preferentially to those who already hold office &ndash;
both since it works more like
a bribe that way and also since incumbents have larger election chances in every
government.
Also since those in power get to do the <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>.
(Consequently in the USA we have 98% re-election rates.)
</p>
<p>
This also causes a certain "stability" &ndash; the stability of permanent
unchallengable corruption!
Hooray.   Now when the power suddenly shifts to the other polarity
we get a seismic thud to reverse direction.  All the gerrymandering is
suddenly redone, all the committee chairs evicted, and all the agency
heads rubberstamp-approved the opposite way.  This thud is the opposite of stability.
</p>
<p>
<i>Compare</i> that with range voting.
Now we have more than 2 parties in power and a diversity of views.
No one party can dominate and gerrymandering is less effective.
A party can get effective dominance via forming a coalition, but
that is a lesser form of dominance.  When the dominance shifts, that is
no longer seismic in scale &ndash; it is a coalition-shift and the
third-party partners
still may side the other way on some issues (similarly appointments
are no longer rubberstamped and committee chairs need not be only of one kind)
consequently the shift is not pole-to-pole but rather partial.  That
lack of an earthquake
seems to me to be <i>more</i> "stability," not less, with range voting.
</p>
<H3> Herman and Taylor &ndash; a paper that is often misquoted </H3>
<p>
W.M. Herman &amp; Michael Taylor: Party systems and government stability, 
Amer. Polit. Sci. Review 65 (1971) 28-37,
showed by analysing a lot of real-world data, that governments
with larger "effective numbers of political parties" tended
to be "less stable" in the sense that they lasted for fewer days on average.
However, this result is easy to misunderstand.  Herman &amp; Taylor when they
said "a government lasted 160 days" did not actually mean that the government <i>ended</i>,
e.g. was overthrown by a coup; they 
actually meant that the government <i>continued on happily</i>,
merely under the control of a different coalition
of political parties in parliament (and they only examined parliamentary democracies).
Their work cast zero light on the <i>real</i> stability question,
of what effect a multiplicity
of political parties has on how long governments (actually) last.
If there are more parties that can form more coalitions in more ways, 
<i>of course</i>
the ruling coalition will change (on average) more often.  
This result was entirely unsurprising and
thus uninformative. 
"Instability" in Herman and Taylor's sense is actually <i>good</i> since it means
that a ruling party cannot maintain permanent control of everything, such as in Japan under
decades-long corrupt single-party rule.

<!--  Other possible answers... in a half baked state...

1) catastrophic switches between two stable-state parties are perceived
as "not too bad" because the winner is part of the existing system.
Thus, while within the system there has been dramatic change, the system
itself (the set of parties that "matter") is the asme.

2) related to this, the notion of "change of government" (as in ruling
coalition) seems to have something of a disingenuous meaning.  I non-FPP
systems, it is often noted that "governments frequently change", which
seems to be naively misinterpreted by many as implying the structure of
government itself has changed, or that government has radically changed
in some other respect.  But this couldn't be further from the truth.

Anyway, all you can do about this is probably, going forward, make a
targetted effort to communicate these clarifications (as I will
too--this discussion has helped my thinking.)

**

I have two empirical "sketches" that could formulate the basis for
responding to this argument:

1) stable governments are not the same as *stable outcomes* (or even
better, desireable ones).  It seems clear to me that while our party
system is stable, our legislation, executive command, and judicial
decision (even at the highest levels) has become utterly chaotic.
I would bet that under range/proportional voting systems, while party
stability might be reduced, outcome stability, consistency, and
desireability would be increased.  If all of this could be measured
somehow, it could make for a pretty convincing argument.

2) measure the progress of countries with better voting systems to date
along these lines, and begin observing them carefully into the future.
One thing to look at to measure outcomes would be macro-economic
metrics, even soft ones like "economic freedom" (a number of indexes for
this exist).  I would hypothesize that countries with better voting
systems will progress "forward" in these various metrics while the US
will decline.  There may already be enough historical data in the 20-50
most recent years past to reveal some interesting things, however.

Colloquially, this seems to be happening.  Median incomes in the US
continue to fall (since the 70s), the Gini index is rising, class
mobility is falling, the prison population is rising (and accelerating),
the black market sector is growing, and economic freedom is falling.
