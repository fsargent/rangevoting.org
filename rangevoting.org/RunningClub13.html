<H2> Gay Asian Pacific Association Foundation 2013 Pride Run Beneficiary Election </H2>

<p>
<small>By Dominic Paris</small>
</p>
<p>
My running club conducted an election to determine the beneficiary of the profits from
our annual run (a purse of about $8,000 to $10,000). 
So, it is competitive. 
Approximately 150 people were eligible to vote. 
86 actually voted. 
There were 14 candidates. 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score voting</a> was used on a scale of <nobr>0-10.</nobr>
</p><p>
Paris concludes based on this election that he'd prefer an 0-5 scale rather than 0-10 because
too many of the votes seem "scattered," concentrated either at the top, 
bottom, or center. (Besides, many other score voting sites like
OkCupid, Netflix, Yelp, etc. tend to use a 0-5 scale.)
</p><p>
Here is a table giving the election in compressed form.
For each of the 14 contenders, table shows <i>how many</i> voters gave them score of 0,1,...,10, 
what its <i>average</i> rating was, what its <i>median</i> rating was (unused, but
included for general interest),
and how many voters gave that contender a score.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Instructions:</b>
Please rate as many of these beneficiaries, on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the 
most deserving and 0 being not deserving at all. You are NOT ranking the nominees, 
and multiple nominees can have the same score. Vote for as many or as few as you wish. 
The nominee with the highest total score will win. In case of a tie, the nominee with 
the highest average score will win.

<b>Notes by WDS:</b>
It seems plausible that with <a href="Plurality.html">plurality voting</a> <i>Larkin</i> &amp;
<i>Dolores</i> would have split the vote... although actually there are a lot
of other opportunities for vote-splitting here so
it would have ended up pretty random and unpredictable.
