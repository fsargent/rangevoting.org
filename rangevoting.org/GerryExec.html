<H2> Gerrymandering and a cure for it &ndash; the shortest splitline 
algorithm (executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Gerrymandering in 2006 USA is enormous and pervasive.
It appears to be more severe than in any other major democracy.
</li><li>
Gerrymandering can lead to near-permanent 1-party domination and essentially
eliminate voter choice.
</li><li>
A simple cure is to draw all districts with the 
<a href="SSArecursive.txt">shortest splitline algorithm</a>
involving approximately-bisecting
a state's population with the shortest eligible splitting line, and then continuing
recursively on the resulting hemi-states.
</li><li>
This way all districts have simple shapes, are completely unbiased, are easily
independently checked, it costs virtually nothing to draw them,
and you don't have to trust anybody.

</li><li>
Experimental fact:
"Independent" and "bi-partisan"
district-drawing commissions often do not work to stop gerrymandering.
