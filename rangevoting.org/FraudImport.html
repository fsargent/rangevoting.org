<H2> Importance of Election Fraud</H2>

<p>
How important is <a href="FraudHist.html">election fraud</a>?
</p>

<p>
That depends heavily on what country we are talking about and during what time period.
We'll focus on the USA in the last 100 years, which appears to have been comparatively
unaffected by fraud.
</p>
<p>
<b>(a)</b> 
It appears during 1900-2004 
(27 US presidential elections)
that 2 of them were altered by fraud/manipulation, namely Bush-Gore
2000 and I'm giving half credit to each of Bush-Kerry 2004 and
Kennedy-Nixon 1960.  That's <b>(7.4&plusmn;5.2)%</b> of presidential races
(where I put in a 1&sigma; error bar; this since based only 2 datapoints
is a very noisy estimate).
</p>
<b>(b)</b> 
In Florida 2000 and Ohio 2004, the fraud &amp; manipulation appears to
have been
approximately of order 120,000 votes in Ohio out of 5.5 million cast,
and 40,000 votes in Florida out of 5.9 million cast. In other words,
current fraud/manipulation levels in the USA under circumstances
likely to generate such,
are of order 0.7% to 2% of the total number of voters.
</p><p>
That's pretty small compared to other effects like gerrymandering and the 
contemporary "gender gap." 
It is fairly <a href="ElMargins.html">rare</a>
that US elections <i>have</i> a
victory margin of 2% or less.
Typical very rough estimates are that this happens in less than
10% of US congress races. [So you can't fraud 90% of US elections
even if you try, using these techniques, and presumably trying happens only some of
(presumably less than half) the time.]
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>US News &amp; World Report 5/7/06</i>:
The Cook Political Report rates just 35 of this fall's 435 House
races as competitive. Other analysts put the number at 25, or fewer
than 6 percent of races. That's down from more than 100 competitive
races in 1992...
with the introduction of sophisticated redistricting software in the
1991 round, the number of competitive races &ndash; where the winner took
less than 52 percent of the vote &ndash; began to drop.
In Pennsylvania, home to half a million more Democrats than
Republicans, GOP-led redistricting turned a congressional delegation
comprising 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats to [in 2000] a 12-to-7
Republican advantage (the state lost two seats because of slow
population growth). 
<br>
"Gerrymanders in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and
Florida pretty much account for the Republican advantage in Congress,"
says George Mason University Prof. Michael McDonald. "If we had
neutral maps, we'd be talking about a much different nation."
<br><br>
Lee Mortimer, <i>Raleigh News and Observer</i>:
fewer than one in ten congressional seats were won by less than
10% in 1998...
More than two in five state legislative elections weren't even
contested by one or the other major parties in 1998.
</blockquote>
<p>
However, you are warned that both fraud and vote-buying
have been considerably more important in US past than it is now;
and
also that computerization poses unprecedented new security threats.
</p>
<p>
While
presidential races are probably less fraudable than other races
since they are more scrutinized, they also are <i>more</i>
fraudable thanks to an interplay with the electoral college.
You can usually count on some state to have
a small enough margin to be fraudable, and then swinging it
can swing the election.

Because "fraud" seems to trigger people's internal "morality watchdog"
whereas, for some reason, <a href="Glossary.html#spoiler">Spoiler</a>
Phenomenon does not, a lot of people get very 
upset about fraud and not about spoiler phenomenon.  Probably about 95%
of voter-reform effort is  fraud-related with only maybe 5% about changing
voting methods to get rid of spoiler and similar effects. But really
I think it should be about 70-30 the other way.   
Morality is emotional, imprecise, and unclear.  (I'm not opposed to morality, I'm 
just saying that a quick thoughtless appeal to emotion is a dangerous thing.)
Importance measurements are clear and unemotional.
The cold hard numbers say that Nader had a comparable or
bigger effect on the 2000
election than all the fraudlike-manipulation in Florida  that year
(which was clearly a fraud hot spot).
Poundstone's book <i>Gaming the Vote</i> documents that US parties are now
funding spoilers like Nader because they think that is easier and cheaper and less risky 
than fraud.  Poundstone claims 7 US presidential races went the wrong way due to spoilers.
But only 2 went the wrong way because of fraud (far as I know).
