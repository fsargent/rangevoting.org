<blockquote>
T<small>HE</small>
republic of Venice has existed longer than those of Rome or Sparta, or 
any other that is known in history. It was at first democratical; and their 
magistrates, under the name of tribunes, were chosen by the people in a general assembly of them...
[but later it became more "aristocratical"]...
Each of the grand counsellors... are reduced...
to eleven fourth electors, and they have the appointment of forty-one, who are the direct electors of the doge. The choice generally turns upon two or three candidates, whose names are put into another box, and drawn out: the first whose name is drawn retires, and proclamation is made for objections against him; if any are made, he comes in, and is heard in his defence: then the electors proceed to determine by ayes and noes; if there are twenty-five ayes, he is chosen, if not, another name is read, and the same decision repeated, until there are twenty five in the affirmative.
<br>
The nobles are divided into six classes. 1. Twelve of the most ancient families. 2. Four families that in the year 880 subscribed to the building of the abbey of St. George. 3. Those whose names were written in the golden book, in 1296. 4. Those that were ennobled by the public in 1385. 5. Those who purchased their nobility for one hundred thousand ducats in 1646. And 6. The strangers who have been received into the number of nobility: the whole make about two thousand five hundred...
<br>
There are four councils: 1. The doge and six signoria. 2. The consiglio grande, in which all the nobles have seats and voices. 3. Consiglio de pregadi, of 250, and is the soul of the republic. 4. Consiglio proprio delli dieci &ndash; and the state inquisitors...
Every province had an assembly besides, and every city, burgomasters, counsellors, and schepens or judges, besides an hooft officer, and his dienders, for the police.
<br>
The history of this country, and its complicated constitutions, affords an inexhaustible store of materials to our purpose, but, considering the critical situation of it, prudence dictates to pass it over: with all the sagacity, and more wisdom than Venice or Berne, it has always had more consideration of the people than either, and has given more authority to the first magistrate: they have never had any exclusive preferences of families or nobles. Offices have, by law at least, been open to all men of merit.

but not exactly correctly) in

In this book
Adams systematically examines every "democratical" and "aristocratical" republic (he ranks
Venice among the latter) as
well as the writings of many philosophers.

<P>
Renaissance 
Venice was a city-state quite in the ancient Greek mold.
The city ruled over a large swath of non-urban territory,
whose borders varied over the centuries.  At its peak, 
Venice's annual trading exceeded that of 
any other city in the world and
it was probably the greatest naval and merchant sea-trading power in the 
Mediterranean. 
Its shipyards could build one warship <i>per day</i>.  
Its trade-ships sailed as far as Iceland.  
<!--The annual value of its trade far exceeded any other city ad equalled that of al Spain, in 1455
says Durant p282.-->
It controlled the whole of Cyprus for  82 years
starting in 1489, and it ruled Crete for 465 years.
Its dominion also included big chunks of what now is Italy, Greece, and Turkey,
including most of the Greek Adriatic coast and
at one point Constantinople itself 
(sacked by crusaders led by Venice in 1204 and held for 56 years).
</p><p>
Venice was an improvement versus the old Greek city-states in that it
did not have slaves (although its sailors risked <i>being</i> enslaved by foreign powers).
<small>
Sorry: turns out Venice <i>did</i> have at least 10000 (but probably less than 50000) slaves, 
mainly Slavic, at one point.  
Lane says "at the beginning of the 14th century, most of the [Venetian] slaves were Greeks... but
later a feeling against enslaving Greek Christians developed... in Venice Slave 
Auctions at the Rialto were forbidden in 1366. For about a century thereafter, many 
slaves were imported to Venice from the Black Sea,
especially Tatars and Russians, but sales were by private contracts."  
Slave-hood was not hereditary thus slaves had to be continually imported.   Both
slaves, convicts, and free men served in the Galleys; there also were slaves (mostly female)
serving
in domestic tasks.  Supposedly slaves were traded until nearly 1600 in Venice despite it
being officially forbidden.  Still, Venice certainly was a lot less into slavery than their
rivals the Ottoman empire.
</small>
Venice was an excellent
democracy if you were one of the top few thousand richest males &ndash;
otherwise, not so much.
(There was, however, a large middle class, and
<i>some</i> power for the other members of society &ndash;
e.g. there were mechanisms for the people, even the non-rich ones,
to make complaints/suggestions to the government&ndash; but it diminished
quickly as you dropped in socio-economic rank.  After 1300 the lower citizens
gradually lost power compared to the richest.  Women were not allowed to vote or
hold elected office, but did own property and make wills independent of their husbands.)
</p><p>
Venice was remarkable in two ways:
<ol>
<li>
Its longetivity, prosperity, and success despite what would appear to be many
inherent disadvantages and dangers;
</li><li>
Its democratic setup &ndash; which employed 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> with a 3-point scale.
</li></ol>
<p>
The Venetian oligarcho-democracy survived many
feuds, coup attempts, threats of civil war, the Black Plague,
foreign wars, assassinations, duels, internal plots
to gain eternal power, and ultra-dangerous schemes by foreign powers.
In particular it <b>outlasted every other Italian state</b> despite
what would seem to be the worst geographic situation.
It was continually surrounded by dangerous enemies plotting to destroy it.
It was located in what was regarded as a poor and waterlogged location
on a bunch of small islands in a marshy lagoon, whose soil was unfarmable &ndash;
and where even the task of acquiring potable water
was and remains very difficult &ndash;
and the whole city was (and continues to be) slowly sinking into the sea!
</p>
<p>
Somehow, despite all that, the Venetians turned their circumstances to their advantage,
became rich and successful, and out-shrewded
and out-lasted all their enemies, for an amazing 529 years (1268-1796)
under their range-voting-based government.
The Venetian Marco Polo famously explored China and many other far lands, 
and many Venetian industries (glass making,
silks, enamels), which led Europe,
were inspired by technology transfer from China and other far places.
<!--Venica also had shipbuilding, iron, leather, gems, textiles.-->
Plus, if you count the additional years of their democracy under the non-range-voting
previous rules (the first democratically elected Doge apparently was
Orso Ipato in 726 AD) that would add about 300 more years to the total.
</p>
<p>
This makes Venice, after <a href="SpartaExec.html">Sparta</a>, the second-longest-lasting
substantially democratic government, in all the world.
</p><p>
I do not believe all that was due to luck.
The Venetians made good decisions and kept making them.   
Over time, that added up.
And, quite plausibly, their government setup, involving range voting, was a <i>reason</i> they
made good decisions.
</p>
<CENTER><H2>Venice's government setup</H2></CENTER>

<p>
Venice had no single written constitution, but it had an Oath Of Office
for the Doge;
and it codified laws in five books of <i>statuti</I> plus extra volumes on maritime law.
</p><p>
Quote [Lane p.95]:
<blockquote>
The series of exceptionally able men who were elected [as Doge] during the century after 1172
are notable for having loyally accepted the restrictions on the office as well as for the 
vigor and wisdom with which they exercised the very considerable power which in that 
century was still retained by the Doge...
</blockquote>
The central organs of government formed a pyramid
<pre>
                       Doge
             Ducal Council [Collegio]
          The Forty and Senate [Pragedi]
         Great Council [Maggior Consiglio]
     ----------- General Assembly ------------
</pre>
<blockquote>
[Each body is successively larger than the last (in terms of membership) as we go down the 
pyramid.  The Great Council had 1000-2500 active members depending on the date and which author is
claiming it.  This picture is an oversimplification.  Lane gives a much larger 
and more detailed organizational chart.]
Each committee or council was checked by some other... so as to assure the rule of law, 
even at the cost of losing some executive efficiency. 
</blockquote>
For example, the Doge was subject to
prosecution (and in at least one case was <i>executed</i>), 
and the State Attorneys indeed could prosecute any official,
and anyone in the Forty could sue anyone for Dereliction of Duty
with the case being heard, ultimately, by the Great Council.
<i>Campaigning</i> for office was forbidden, and indeed you could be elected 
<i>without running</i> for office, at which point it was your patriotic
duty to serve &ndash; like it or not.  Although this may sound crazy, it 
seems to have had a purpose &ndash; to prevent ambitious politicians from existing.
(Also, imagine if, in, say, the contemporary United States, we could elect <i>anybody</i>,
picking from the entire populace the person most-suited to be president, regardless of
whether that person had any intention of running.  Might that result in, on average,
better presidents?  I think it would.)
I somehow doubt that those elected were entirely unwilling, though.  Surely that would
not have been workable?
</p><p>
Nominees were often chosen by committees, who in
turn were selected by a hopefully-incorruptible <i>random</i> process
(involving selecting balls from urns)
then the election for that position was among
those who had been nominated.
By having multiple stages of both random and election processes the Venetians tried to make
the system <i>incorruptible</i> (thanks to the randomness) but also striving for maximum 
<i>quality</i> 
(due to the democratic electing-the-best processes).
</p>
<p>
Thus the process for electing the Doge, as of 1268 (when it was employed for the election of
Lorenzo Tiepolo), had reached this amazing
almost-final form [Lane p.111; also described by Lines p.156]:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Choose 30 of the Great Council members (of whom there were 1000-to-1500, typically; all male)
by a random process;
</li><li>
Reduce them to 9 by  random processes;
</li><li>
The 9 name 40 nominees;
</li><li>
The 40 are reduced to 12 by a random process;
</li><li>
the 12 name 25 nominees;
</li><li>
Reduce them to 9 by  random processes;
</li><li>
The 9 name 45 nominees;
</li><li>
Reduce them to 11 by random processes;
</li><li>
The 11 named 41 (all of whom had to be age&ge;40 years);
</li><li>
<b>The 41 elected the Doge (from among nominees they chose; any of the 41 could write a name 
on a slip of paper, and from then onward, that name was a candidate)
by range3 voting!</b>
</li><li>
This choice theoretically
was subject to approval or veto by the mass of the people (assembly) but I
am unaware of any instance in which that veto was exercised.
<small>
This perhaps meant this step was a mere formality with the People not really having any power.
But another interpretation is that the <i>threat</i> of a veto kept the Grand Council honest
in its choice &ndash; they refused to risk the embarrassment of a veto.
</small>
</li></ol>
<p>
In this process, only the penultimate step &ndash; the election &ndash; "really mattered" &ndash;
the rest was mainly intended to make the identity of the 41 <i>unpredictable</i>
hence making the process (hopefully) uncorruptible.
The 41, during their deliberations, were
<i>sequestered</i> rather like the juries in modern-day big-time criminal cases.  
This again was presumably intended to insulate them from corruption.
</p><p>
The voters employed "range3" voting to elect the Doge.
That is, each voter gave a score from the 3-element set {-1, 0, +1} to each candidate
(this was accomplished via a scheme involving balls you could put into boxes, where
there was one box for each candidate).
The candidate with the greatest
score won.  However, there was also a supermajority requirement:
in order to win, you had to get at least 25 
"approval" (i.e. +1) votes.  This, note, exceeds
a bare majority (which would be 21).  If the winner did not achieve
this 25-approval threshold, then deliberations by the 41 would continue with
re-votes as necessary until somebody achieved the threshold.
<small> 
Incidentally, by a coincidence (?) or brilliant design (?) the 
25 threshold is exactly the greatest integer below 63.2% of 41,
and a paper by A.Caplin &amp; B.Nalebuff: <i>On 64% majority rule</i>,
Econometrica 56,4 (1998) 787-814
claims that 63.2% has theoretical advantages as a threshold.
(Specifically, "preference cycles" of 63.2%-supermajority preferences are impossible
under certain assumptions about voter distributions.  This theorem seems
unlikely to me to have much practical importance.)
<!-- Namely using the threshold T=1-[n/(n+1)]<sup>n</sup> 
(which increases as n&rarr;infin; 
toward the limit
T=1-e<sup>-1</sup>&asymp;0.63212),
if the preferences have "convex" structure such that the voters
prefer intermediate candidates over the "average" of extremist candidates
in an "n-dimensonal issue space,"
then an unbeatable candidate exists 
and no <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">cycles</a>
are possible. -->
</small>
</p><p>
In at least one case (1229 AD: Giacomo Tiepolo vs Marino Dandolo), 
a deadlock (perfect tie) occurred, which had to be resolved by a coin flip.
The number 41, being odd, was designed to make such ties less likely.
</p><p>
The Great Council also elected people to hundreds of other more minor positions (ambassadors,
etc).  It appears that in all or some of those elections, the 
<nobr>{+1, -1, 0}</nobr> voting method with 
balls was again used.
<small>
For example, to elect magistrates (Chambers et al. p.59)
a 4-candidate {&ndash;1, 0, +1}-range voting election 
(with positive-total as a "quorum condition" &ndash; if nobody got a positive then
there was no winner and the election was redone later with perhaps-different candidates)
was held using red and green urns to hold the
+1 and &ndash;1 votes, respectively.
</small>
</p><p>
Although there were some minor adjustments to the procedures during the 529 years after 1268, 
according to Lines they <i>were</i> minor and the system remained
essentially unchanged thereafter, suggesting the Venetians were satisfied with
its performance.   On the other hand, the democratic procedures the Venetians used
<i>before</i> 1268 were evidently felt unsatisfactory &ndash; too vulnerable
to corruption and/or electing not-good-enough Doges, who in some cases replaced
democracy with autocracy.
</p>

<CENTER><H2>Why did Venice Eventually Fail?</H2></CENTER>

<p>
Rowson is of the apparent opinion that Venice gradually became corrupt.
The problem was that their democracy was intended to be for the benefit of the 
rich male "nobles," which was <i>not</i> the same as for "everyone."
That may have been good at first because those were the smartest most successful people
in Venice and their interests coincided well with "everyone's."
But toward the end, they weren't the smartest who got rich due to
their shrewdness and merchant success; they were just
the ones who happened to be born into
the right family lines, and they stayed rich by corrupting government
power (e.g. customs duties) for their own purposes.
According to Rowson, "Venice was being bled dry so that the aristocrats could 
keep gambling at the tables."  And, we might add, cavorting with prostitutes.
By the time Napoleon the juggernaut came, the
once-huge Venetian navy was down to only a few ships and there was nothing they could
do to defend themselves.
</p><p>
Rowson doesn't complain so much about the election results being bad decisions
&ndash; he thinks they were still adequate &ndash; so much as the <i>entirety</i> 
of government becoming corrupted.  Further, with time the power of the Doge gradually diminished 
relative to the other branches of government (he was hemmed in by more and more restrictions 
and counterbalances) to the point where he was a tool of the Noble Families.  That, in
the end, was bad.  
</p><p>
(Of course, it might be that even without all those problems, 
Venice would <i>still</i> have been unable to stop Napoleon. If so, then these problems 
did not ultimately matter.)
</p>
<p> 
As evidence for his corrupt-aristocracy theory, Rowson offers the following table
concerning the last 8 Doge-elections.  The right-hand column shows the <i>bill</i>, submitted
by the sequestered committee that elected the Doge, for all the conspicuous
consumption (gluttony of immense amounts of luxury foods, footmen, rose water, tobacco, etc)
during their deliberations.   The numbers
keep growing.
The cost of electing Manin was over <i>five times</i> that of electing Ruzzini,
and the total bill of 378000 Lire was a fortune, exceeding a lifetime income.
[Note:  Venetian money was gold coins each specified to contain a certain amount &ndash;
unchanged since the 1200s &ndash; of gold.  This is not inflationary
paper-money era here.]

<p>
Rowson thinks any Committee of Venice's Finest

its honesty and was purely about reaming what was left of Venice for their
personal benefit.

<CENTER><H2>List of Venetian Doges</H2></CENTER>

<p>
All Doges are known, and we list them below.  (They usually served for
the remainder of their lives, but sometimes quit or were forcibly removed.)
However I do not know the non-winners of Doge elections, nor the stories of how the 
elections proceeded (except in just a few cases described in the sources above).
</p>
<a name="FoscariManip"></a>
<p>
<small> Norwich p.300 describes one alleged example of strategic voting leading
to the 1423 election of the underdog candidate F.Foscari.  (Foscari wanted Venice
to go on offense militarily and expand by force &ndash; a highly controversial policy
which later turned out to be very successful for Venice, but made both Foscari 
and Venice a lot of powerful enemies.)
He got 17 approvals out of 41 in the 9th ballot,
then was elected in the 10th ballot by 26.
Supposedly his supporters had engineered that by voting in earlier ballots for
a candidate nobody wanted, thus enticing others to vote for Foscari &ndash;
then suddenly unexpectedly switching their votes  to Foscari.  This is, essentially,
a manipulation of "pre-election polls" to affect future strategic voting decisions
in the "real election."  <a href="DynDefn.html">DYN</a> is a modification of approval
voting, invented by Forest Simmons, intended to prevent that sort
of manipulation.
<br><br>
In a different interesting election recounted by either Lane or Norwich (I lost my notes), one 
candidate was viewed as almost certain to win.  However, a raucous demonstration  against
him (which the book claimed was probably organized and paid for by one of his rivals) 
was held outside the area in the Doge's palace in which the 41 were deliberating.
The 41 took this into account &ndash; they did not want to risk that this candidate would lead
to discord &ndash; and therefore elected another.  So while theoretically the 41 were 
supposed to be sequestered and totally immune from outside influences,  this evidently
was not perfect.
</small>
</p>
<p>
It would not surprise me if a great amount of
that information still exists (Venice was never destroyed
and never suffered serious damage &ndash; e.g. they yielded to Napoleon essentially 
without a fight &ndash; and there is a tremendous literature on Venetian history) 
but if so, I do not presently have it.
But even if I <i>did</i> know all that, it would be difficult to use it to "prove" to <i>you</i>
that range3 voting "worked well" for Venice.   What we need is to condense all
that info into some kind of time-average measure
of how well it worked.   
What could that measure be?  Well... how about the
remarkable prosperity and
longetivity of Venice despite its circumstances...?
