<H1> The "bullet voting" bugaboo </H1>

<p><small>(skip to <a href="#summ">summary</a>)</small></p>

<p>
Some <a href="RichieRVessay.html#bull">critics</a> 
of <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> and/or 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting, most notably IRV propagandists at "FairVote,"
have argued that these systems will in practice degenerate to plain 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.
That is, the voters will score their favorite maximum, and all rivals co-minimum.
FairVote calls that "bullet voting" and
contends it, in contrast, would not be a problem with IRV (instant runoff).
</p>

<blockquote>
One problem with approval voting, for example, is that voters are instinctively reluctant to give equal weight to a candidate they really like and candidates they can merely tolerate. The result is often "bullet voting," which range voting also encourages.

<blockquote>
Because "approving" a second choice may help defeat the voter's first choice, 
most experts agree that it [Approval Voting] is likely to devolve to typical vote-for-one 
plurality voting.

<h2> The evidence </h2>
<p>
<b>I.</b>
In the <A href="FrenchStudy.html">French approval voting study</a>
(thousands of voters, 16 candidates,
presidential election of 2002; probably the largest approval voting
study ever), the plurality vote totalled 100% and the approval votes
totalled <b>315%</b>, and the percentage of "bullet style" (approves exactly
one) ballots was <b>11.1%</b>. 
</p><p>
Let us compare that head to head with the (similar parameters)
San Francisco Mayoral election of 2007
(12 candidates,
143359 voters).  FairVote, the IRV propaganda group, touted SF's
adoption of IRV as a "great success" and Hertzberg himself listed SF
as an example IRV city in his very <i>New Yorker</I> blog post we quoted from above.  This is, as
far as I know, the largest IRV election ever carried out on US soil
during the 50 years prior, if not all time.  Checking the 
<a href="SF07HumanRead.txt ">full ballot dataset</a>
we see that 
over 76063 (<b>53%</b>) of San Francisco's IRV ballots were "bullet" style.
The total number of candidates ranked on those ballots amounted to <b>below
187%</b> of the total number of ballots.
</p><blockquote><small>
There were 67590 "bullet" votes for Newsom,
3825 for Hoogasian, 2539 for Pang, 590 for Sumchai,
and 349 for Rinaldi out of  143359 total accepted IRV ballots.
</small></blockquote><p>
Thus, this head-to-head comparison suggests that "bullet" voting is more common with the IRV
system brought to SF by FairVote, than it is with approval voting.  
(Indeed, in this case, hugely more common.)
</p>
<p>
IRV advocates may also be interested in the following.  
In some parts of Australia (the top IRV-using 
country) it was made legal for voters to rank fewer than all candidates, indeed the
Australian word for "bullet voting" (the extreme case of ranking only a single candidate)
is "plumping."   This was made legal in Queensland
in 1992.  This first year in which plumping was permitted, the plumping rate was 23%.
But this appears to have grown over time.  In the 2009 elections, 
the Electoral Commission of Queensland, published these results from
a sample of 10 Australian electorates giving the
plumping and partial (not full) preference voting percentages:
</p>
<table bgcolor="pink">
<tr bgcolor="yellow"><th>Party</th><th>Plumping</th><th>Partial Preferences</th><th>Full Preferences</th></tr>
<tr><td>Labor Party</td><td>56.5</td><td> 14.5</td><td> 29.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liberal National Party</td><td> 74.8</td><td>  2.3</td><td>  22.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Greens</td><td> 45.6</td><td>  6.1</td><td>  48.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Daylight Saving Party</td><td> 32.2</td><td>  10.3 </td><td> 57.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Family First</td><td> 48.2</td><td>  4.6</td><td>  47.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Independents/Others</td><td> 55.9</td><td>  4.4</td><td>  39.7</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
It is unusual for approval voting elections 
to have plumping rates as high as even the lowest (32.2%) among these.
</P>
<p>
<b>II.</b>
Now let us perform a second head-to-head comparison of similar-parameter elections.
The <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a> Mayoral Election of 2009, another IRV
election for which I have
the <a href="JLburl09.txt">full ballot set</a> (6 candidates), 
featured 1481 "bullet style" votes out of 8980 valid ballots (<b>16.5%</b>)
and 21.5% of ballots ranked exactly two candidates.
Vermont Maths. Professor Robert Z. Norman points out 
that this 6-candidate race was to a decent approximation really only a 3-candidate race
between the incumbent, the Democrat, and the Republican
(since the other 3 got a lot fewer votes); and over 26% of the voters ranked only one among the 
big three.  So some might argue the <i>effective</i> rate of bullet voting
was closer to 26% than 16.5%.
</p><p>
The <a href="UNsecyGen.html">UN secretary general election</a> of 2006 (approval voting, 6
candidates)  featured 39
approvals, 35 disapprovals, and 16 "no opinion" votes from 15 voters,
an approval fraction of <b>260%</b>.  Since the ballots were secret
I do not actually know the percentage of
approve-1-disapprove-rest
"bullet style" ballots, but it is possible to tell from the data they did publish,
that at most 3 of the 15 voters cast a bullet-style ballot.
<!--
</p>
<ul>
<li>
At most 1 of the 5 "permanent members" cast a bullet-style ballot.
</li><li>
At most 3 of the 15 voters cast a bullet-style ballot for Ban.
</li><li>
Zero voters cast a bullet-syle ballot against Ban.
</li></ul>
<p>
-->
I.e, the percentage of bullet-voters was <i>at most 20%</i>.
This is only an upper bound.  The lower bound is 0.  
There overall were more approvals than disapprovals,
the exact opposite of what would have happened if there had been a lot of
bullet voting.
Also, if there really were 3 bullet-ballots (meeting the upper bound) then 
the remaining 12 ballots would each have had to have approved exactly 3 of the
6 candidates &ndash; or somebody must have approved at least 4 of the 6.  
The uniqueness of this (1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3) configuration 
and the fact it contains a "gap" at 2 both make it seem unlikely;
and it also seems unlikely (especially to believers in the prevalence of "bullet voting")
that any voter approved 4.
Therefore it is <i>likely</i> that the 20% upper bound can be decreased to <b>13.3%</b>.
Hence the truth probably 
is either 0, 1/15=6.7%, or 2/15=13.3%.
</p><p>
<b>III.</b>
For our third head-to-head comparison, we can contrast the first four USA presidential elections
(approval voting, essentially)
with the three Irish IRV presidential elections.
</p><p>
The <a href="EarlyUS.html">early USA</a> conducted its first 4 presidential elections with approval
voting, <i>except</i> it was forbidden to approve 3 or more candidates; and the 2nd-place 
finisher  became vice president as an almost worthless "consolation prize."
</p><dl>
<dt><b>1788-9:</b></dt>
<dd>
All 69 electors each approved the maximum allowed number (2) among the 12 candidates.
</dd>
<dt><b>1792:</b></dt>
<dd>
All 132 electors each approved the maximum allowed number (2) among the 5 candidates.
</dd>
<dt><b>1796:</b></dt>
<dd>
All 138 electors each approved the maximum allowed number (2) among the 12 candidates.
There were thus zero bullet-style votes.
It has been argued, though, that 9 second-approvals were "effectively not there" since
they were not for Thomas Pinckney whom they "should have been" for, but rather for no-hopers,
as "another means of casting an effectively-bullet" vote.  I do not agree such should
qualify as "bullet votes,"
but if you want to count them that way they would be 9/138=6.5%.
</dd>
<dt><b>1800:</b></dt>
<dd>
There were 138 electors.
Of these 137 approved 
the maximum allowed number (2) among the 5 candidates,
while one &ndash; Anthony Lispenard from New York &ndash; bullet-voted for Aaron Burr.
But this bullet-vote was disallowed because the US Constitution
forbade an elector's first approval from being for
anybody from his own state, and Burr was from New York.
Lispenard had written "Burr" for <i>both</i> of his allowed approvals (which 
also was technically illegal since it would have given Burr 2, as opposed to 1;
he should have just written "Burr" and "Nobody").
Lispenard demanded a <i>secret</i> ballot in which case his disobeyals of the rules 
would not have been detectable and he would have gotten away with it and made Burr the victor!
However, his demand was rejected because New York State law forbade ballot secrecy in 
NY electoral votes.
The Electoral College after consulting with New York's
delegation,  decided therefore to change Lispenard's vote (against his will?)
to "approve Burr &amp; Jefferson."
This led to a Burr-Jefferson tie.
Lispenard could have caused Burr to win outright
by simply not casting his first approval
(or voting it for some no-hoper),
although he did not know that when he voted.
</dd>

<p>
The percentage of bullet-style ballots in all 4 of the US presidential elections
carried out with (restricted) approval voting, then, was
either <b>0</b> or <b>0.2%</b> depending on how we view Lispenard
(or <b>2.1%</b> even if you count both  Lispenard and all 9 alleged Pinckney-denials).
It is plausible that there would have been 3-approving ballots if the rules had allowed it.
This contrasts with, e.g. the entire history of Irish presidential elections,
all of which were carried out with IRV.  Counting only the 3
elections (1945, <a href="Ireland1990.html">1990</a>, 1997) 
with at least 3 candidates running
so that "full ranking" actually could meaningfully differ from "bullet voting,"
it appears that somewhere between
<b>9.5%</b> and <b>31.8%</b> of the ballots were bullet style (based on the percentages
of "nontransferable" votes among those ballots that "tried" to transfer).
</p><blockquote><small>
In
<a href="Ireland1990.html">1990</a>
after Currie was eliminated, his 267902 votes "tried" to transfer, but
25548 failed to do so because they were (either intentionally or accidentally)
bullet-style ballots, a rate of
25548/267902=9.5%.
In 1945, also a 3-candidate election,
after McCartie was eliminated, his 212834 votes "tried" to transfer, but
67748 failed to do so, a rate of
67748/212834=31.8%.
<!-- 1997: 66061 failed to transfer to the final two (3 candidates eliminated simultaneously)
out of 323410 attempts, failure rate 20.4%. But not all of these were necessarily "bullet,"
they merely were "truncated."-->
</small></blockquote>
<p>
Actually, these estimates are probably all <i>under</i>estimates since they were based
on voters for "underdogs" and who hence would have had high incentive to rank further choices.
The voters for "overdogs" would have had less such incentive, i.e. would have been
more likely to "bullet vote."  (C.f. the San Francisco election above where Newsom was 
the "overdog" and got a lot of bullet votes.)
So probably 9.5% and 31.8% are merely lower bounds.
</p><a name="Dartmouth"></a><p>
<b>IV.</b> Dartmouth College's
<b>alumni association</b> <a href="DartmouthBack.html">used</a>
approval voting during 1990-2007 to fill vacancies as they arose on its 18-member
Board of Trustees.
Each election involved 3 "nominated" candidates plus perhaps additional "petition" candidates
(usually 3 or 4 in all).  The final approval-voting election, held in 2007,
had 4 candidates.
It was won by S.F.Smith with 9984 approvals on 18186 ballots (54.9% approval).
There were 32941 approvals in all, i.e. <b>181%</b>.
This implies that at most 59.5% of the ballots were bullet-style,
and the only way it would be possible to meet this upper bound would be if every
ballot approved either 1 or 3 candidates (never 2).  If instead every ballot approved either 1 or
2 <!-- &ndash; as was the only sane possibility in the 3-person races &ndash; -->
then the fraction of approve-1 ballots would have had to be 19%.
So the bullet fraction, we estimate, was between <b>19% and 59.5%</b>.
</p><p>
Meanwhile Dartmouth's <b>students</b> used instant runoff voting to elect their
Student President.  You can see their 2006 election results 
<a href="DartmouthStudPres2006.pdf">here</a>.  
</p><blockquote><small>
Frankly, this 2006 election seems
like an absurd disaster for IRV because there were 176 candidates.  
Only three of these 176 candidates were on-ballot (Chick, Patinkin, and Zubricki);
the other 173 were "write-ins," including the eventual winner, 
Timothy A. Andreadis.  Most of the write-ins got zero votes, which
was strange.
(Couldn't you vote for yourself? Or was their computer system defective?) 
Obviously, it was not going to be attractive for voters to provide a full rank ordering
of all 176, and indeed I doubt that any voter provided such an ordering nor that any voter
even knew who most of the 176 even <i>were</i>.
Nevertheless FairVote applauded Dartmouth for adopting IRV and
featured this exact election on their web page.
</small></blockquote>
<p>
There were 2435 voters. 
In the 10th and final round of IRVing
Andreadis's 1127 votes defeated David S. Zubricki's 913.
To a good approximation, 
this was only a 3-man race between Andreadis, Zubricki, and Adam Patinkin.
The other 173 could have been eliminated <i>immediately</i> if Dartmouth had used
a better algorithm.  That's because A, Z, and P got 1025, 577, and 554 top-rank votes immediately
while the remaining 173 candidates all <i>combined</i> into
an imaginary "supercandidate" (call it "S") only got 279 (11.5%).   
Restrict attention,
then, to the 4 candidates A, Z, P, and S.
</p>
<ul><li>
The 279 S-voters also ranked somebody in {A,Z,P} 148 times, so there were 131
bullet-type S-votes (47.0%) &ndash; not all of which necessarily <i>really</i> were
"bullet" votes because remember that S is an imaginary supercandidate. 
(But considering the great unpopularity of S, it seems likely that most of them really were.)
</li><li>
The 554 P-voters also ranked somebody in {A,Z} at most 341 times, so there were &ge;213
votes (&ge;38.4%) each of which either was a bullet-vote for P, or ranked P and S only.
</li><li>
The 577 Z-voters
also ranked A at most 142 times, so there were &ge;435
votes (&ge;75.4%) which either were a bullet-vote for Z, or ranked Z and {P and/or S} only.
</li></ul>
<p>
In view of the above, it seems reasonable to estimate that <b>about 40%</b> 
of the IRV ballots were
bullet-style.
</p>

<h2> Logic </h2>

<p>
With approval voting, there certainly are situations in which a voter would have incentive
to "bullet vote."
But there also are situations where a voter would be foolish to bullet vote.
</p>

<ul><li>
For an example where only an idiot would "bullet vote":
suppose your favorite is F, and the total approval counts are A=974, B=974, F=231,
then you would be foolish to bullet-vote for F.  By approving both F <i>and</i>
your favorite among {A,B}
you swing the election.
<blockquote><small>
Want to make that a little more concrete?
A common example (often cited by FairVote in other contexts) is a voter who preferred
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 USA Presidential election, but 
insincerely voted for Democrat Al Gore in order not to "waste her vote" under
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting (because the
<a href="Flor2000Res.html">real</a> battle 
was between Gore &amp; Bush).
If it had been approval voting, do you think this voter would:
<ol type="a"><li>
Approve both Gore
<i>and</i> Nader (and any other candidates that voter preferred over Gore)
</li>
<li>
<i>Only</i> approve Gore
</li>
<li>
<i>Only</i> approve Nader?
</li></ol>
Which would be the smart move?
</small></blockquote>
</li><li>
For an example where bullet voting is the uniquely best move, suppose the approval-totals
are A=574, B=574, C=574, an exact 3-way tie.  But now you get to vote.
</li></ul>

<p>
Which occurs more frequently?
</p><blockquote><small>
Michael Rouse points out that we actually have evidence on exactly that.   
In Florida 2000, there
were  111251 
<a href="FL2001-05-10-overvotetable.html">overvotes</a> versus 
only 97488 <a href="Flor2000Res.html">valid</a> votes for Nader &ndash;
<i>even though overvotes were illegal and discarded</i> since that election unfortunately 
was <i>not</i> conducted using
approval voting.  This suggests that the desire to vote in non-bullet style is much, much
larger than the desire to bullet-vote for a third-party candidate.
</small></blockquote><p>
One fact to consider is:
bullet-voting in range voting elections with large numbers of voters
is 
<a href="RVstrat3.html">usually</a> 
a dumb strategic idea...  One way to see that intuitively is Mike Ossipoff's 
&quot;<a href="Approval.html#pairsarg">voting power ratio</a>&quot;; by approval voting in 
"bullet" style you tend to sacrifice a lot of "voting power."
</p>

<a name="summ"></a>
<h2> Summary </h2>

<p>
There is not a great deal of evidence available due to the relative paucity of historically
important IRV and 
approval elections for which we have ballot data (and in some cases we were forced to
work from incomplete ballot data, and thus could get only approximate results or merely
bounds).
But it appears that <i>every one</i> of
the first three approval election sets above, involved smaller percentages of
"bullet style" ballots than <i>every one</i>  of the first three IRV election sets.
</p><blockquote><small>
We can't tell for set IV because the data is too imprecise.  Actually IV is not a good comparison
anyhow because its elections were quite dissimilar; its only similarity is 
the <i>electorates</i> &ndash;
Dartmouth alumni &amp; students. (Also it has no historical importance.)
For those worried that IV may be an exception to the pattern that IRV elections 
have more bullet voting than approval elections, note that (as one would 
a priori have expected) there seems to be a trend for
more bullet voting in approval elections with fewer candidates.
I, II, and III all compare elections with the same (or close) numbers of candidates.
IV is different: Since it compares a 176-candidate IRV election(!)
with a 4-candidate approval election, this is no "exception" at all.

<p>
We <a href="RangePolls.html">also</a> have a large set of range-style and approval-style
<i>polls</i> and in them, again, bullet-voting obviously occurred only at small levels and 
was not a problem.
</p>
<p><b>Criticisms (ranging from silly to not-so-silly):</b></p>
<small>
<ol><li>
Lest FairVote wants to charge us with some 
sort of bias in cherrypicking "atypically bad" IRV elections, we point out that FairVote 
<i>lauded</i> the 
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a>, 
San Francisco, and
<a href="Ireland1990.html">Ireland 1990</a>
elections as
"great successes" and has often touted them as examples to show how "wonderful" IRV is
and how well it performs; FairVote indeed was instrumental in
making the first two enact IRV.  Anyhow, if should be obvious there was no such bias;
the elections were chosen to try to (a) make the members of each pair similar in some important
way, e.g. #candidates, (b) to try to make them historically-important, and (c) to try to chose
elections where the data was available.
</li><li>
Also, in case FairVote wants to charge us with choosing
approval elections with <i>few</i> voters (UN &amp; USA) &ndash; a correct charge &ndash; we point
out that the strategic incentive for approval voters to bullet-vote
is <a href="RVstrat3.html">greater</a> with
fewer voters, i.e. this "charge" actually only makes our argument <i>more valid</i>.
</li><li>
Lest FairVote wants to claim III's early USA elections were not "really" 
approval voting, we point out that the <a href="EarlyUS.html">paper</a>
identifying it as such was written by Prof. Jack H. Nagel, a member of FairVote's 
(then the 'Center for Voting &amp; Democracy')
<i>own</i>
"advisory committee"!  And this paper was quoted from by Rob Richie, head of FairVote,
who at the time tried to use it to argue that the Early-USA elections did not work out so well
and hence approval voting was a poor voting system.  (Oops.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The main differences between the early USA
rules and genuine approval voting were (a) the 2-approval limit (which only helps us here by making
our argument more valid) and (b) the vice-president "consolation prize."
I think (b) is a valid criticism (although a isn't).
But: Obviously, in <i>any</i> approval election there <i>always</i> is a 
"consolation prize" available &ndash; the honor and publicity of finishing second!
This is important since it can enable that finisher's entire future political career.
Quite possibly, that importance is comparable to the importance of the vice presidency
in relation to the president ("Not worth a bucket of warm piss" &ndash; USA vice president
Jake Garner).  
So, you can judge for yourself how greatly to be
impressed by (b). One should be impressed by it, but the question is how much.
<!-- the immense logical impact of (b).-->
</li><li>
FairVote claimed to us (with no evidence as usual)
that the predilection for bullet-style approval voting takes many years to develop, hence 
they were unimpressed by all our approval voting elections here.
It appears that the approval-voting
<a href="ApprovalPopes.html">election</a> of Pope Leo XI in 1605, carried 
out after over <i>3 centuries</i> of
approval-voting pope-elections by <i>extremely</i> strategic cardinals, 
involved at least 350% total approval, i.e. each voter approved at least 3.5 candidates on average.
</li><li>
The criticism which seems to me to be the most valid, is simply the fact we've only got four
pairs (or 7 pairs, if you pair off the 3 Irish with 3 most-corresponding early-USA mates), 
i.e. not a lot of data.  Our statistical confidence, therefore, that 
IRV elections really have more bullet voting than approval elections, is somewhere in
the 90-99% range
(as opposed to, say, 99.9999%, which is the sort of number you generally get when you have
lots of data).  Even so, though, this is enough to cast a cloud of great skepticism 
over this entire "horrible bugaboo" of "bullet voting" raised by range/approval opponents
and IRV supporters all
without presenting <i>any</i> evidence of their own, e.g. Hertzberg &amp; Bouricius in
their essays from which we quoted at top.
</li></ol>
</small>
<p>
So in short, had Hertzberg, Bouricius, and FairVote consulted the available evidence they would
have found that their "bullet voting bugaboo" argument contradicted it.
Their "argument" for IRV and against approval voting, at least in view of this evidence
really is an argument 
<i>for</i> approval and <i>against</i> IRV!
