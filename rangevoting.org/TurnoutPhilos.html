Biases in Turnouts &ndash; philosophical discussion by 
<a href= "http://AllAboutVoting.com">Greg Wolfe</a> 
</H2>

<p>
This essay was inspired by the following conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>A:</b>
It looks like the fact the USA does not have compulsory
voting, universal suffrage, and automatic universal registration,
causes large biasing of the vote.
<br>
<b>B:</b>
But that bias could be beneficial, from a
utilitarian standpoint.
</blockquote>

<p>
I agree with B's statement, but I think that it is important to
note that we are at the edge of a slippery slope.
Going down that slope for a moment...:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>
There is an argument that choosing to participate indicates that a
voter cares and is knowledgeable (&rArr; disfavor mandatory voting)
</li><li>
There is an argument that being able to get over minor voting
barriers indicates that a voter cares and is knowledgeable (&rArr; favor
keeping election day as a single inconvenient day [Tuesdays] as
opposed to having a longer period or weekend voting, favor voter ID
requirements)
</li><li>
There is an argument that having access to excess resources
indicates that a voter is more vested in the system and has more
socially useful views (&rArr; favor poll tax, voter tests, property
requirements)
</li></ol>
(I) is a fine step for me. (II) is distasteful but I'm willing to
listen and might be convinced. I find (III) completely unacceptable.
</p><p>
In my view the utilitarian worldview of what is best for society is
not enough. There also needs to be a principle-based "fairness
doctrine" that encourages participation and doesn't raise extraneous
barriers to voting. 
Some reforms might be worthwhile even if they have little or negative impact
from a utilitarian viewpoint. 
For example, I would support women's
suffrage even if it turned out to be harmful from a utilitarian viewpoint.
</p><p>
To attend more to our current political situation: I support measures
to reduce election fraud even when the fraud levels are low enough or
unbiased enough not to have a major clear impact on actual results.
</p><p>
So what is the "take-away lesson" here?
</p><p>
When comparing the impact of competing factors [like women's suffrage
vs election fraud] there are at least three measures:
<ol>
<li>
How influential (on altering election winners) is the factor?
</li><li>
How <i>beneficially</i> influential is an factor? (utilitarian view)
</li><li>
How strong is the <i>principle</i> of the factor?
</li></ol>
<p>
All are interesting.  For example, it is an interesting type-1 statement that
black votes in the USA currently have more winner-altering effect than women's votes,
even though from a pure type-3 point of view women's votes are more
important since there are more women.
</p>
<p>
(1) is the easiest to measure.  (2) can be hard to measure (or even to define)
in the <i>real world</i>, but in some
cases can be easy to measure in computer <i>simulations.</i>
(3) is subject to the criticism that your moral principles may differ from mine...
the basic principle I have in mind is that it is immoral to
deprive people, against their will, of equal political rights.
