<H1>How to prove it</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Proof by example:<DD>
	The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it 
	contains most of the ideas of the general proof.
<P>
<DT>Proof by intimidation:<DD>
	'Trivial'.
<P>
<DT>Proof by vigorous handwaving:<DD>
	Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
<P>
<DT>Proof by cumbersome notation:<DD>
	Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
	symbols.
<P>
<DT>Proof by exhaustion:<DD>
	An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.
<P>
<DT>Proof by omission:<DD>
	'The reader may easily supply the details'<BR>
	'The other 253 cases are analogous'<BR>
	'...' 
<P>
<DT>Proof by obfuscation:<DD>
	A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless 
	syntactically related statements.
<P>
<DT>Proof by wishful citation:<DD>
	The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of 
	a theorem from the literature to support his claims.
<P>
<DT>Proof by funding:<DD>
	How could three different government agencies be wrong?
<P>
<DT>Proof by eminent authority:<DD>
	'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
	complete.' 
<P>
<DT>Proof by personal communication:<DD>
	'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete 
	[Karp, personal communication].' 
<P>
<DT>Proof by reduction to the wrong problem:<DD>
	'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is 
	decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.' 
<P>
<DT>Proof by reference to inaccessible literature:<DD>
	The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found 
	in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian 
	Philological Society, 1883.
<P>
<DT>Proof by importance:<DD>
	A large body of useful consequences all follow from the 
	proposition in question.
<P>
<DT>Proof by accumulated evidence:<DD>
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.
<P>
<DT>Proof by cosmology:<DD>
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.
<P>
<DT>Proof by mutual reference:<DD>
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.
<P>
<DT>Proof by metaproof:<DD>
	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The 
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these 
	techniques.
<P>
<DT>Proof by picture:<DD>
	A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well 
	with proof by omission.
<P>
<DT>Proof by vehement assertion:<DD>
	It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the 
	audience.
<P>
<DT>Proof by ghost reference:<DD>
	Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in 
	the reference given.
<P>
<DT>Proof by forward reference:<DD>
	Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, 
	which is often not as forthcoming as at first.
<P>
<DT>Proof by semantic shift:<DD>
	Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed 
	for the statement of the result.
<P>
<DT>Proof by appeal to intuition:<DD>
	Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.
