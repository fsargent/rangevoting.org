<b>About ballot formats:</b>
There are three main formats: (i) ratings, (ii) equalities with ratings, and (iii) rank-ordering.
Every format is 1 vote per line.
We explain them by example:
<br>
<b>i.</b>
<pre>
54: 95 32 11
2: 9 0 3
1 1 5
3: 55,6, 2
</pre>
would mean 54 identical votes of (95,32,11); 2 identical votes of (9,0,3); one vote (1,1,5),
and 3 identical votes (55,6,2).
You can use white space and/or commas.  Number before a colon (if any) is number of identical
votes.  These would all be in a 3-candidate election.
<br>
<b>ii.</b>
<pre>
54: A=95 B=32 C=11
2: B=0 C=3 A=9
B=1,A=1 C=5
3: A=55,B=6, C=2
</pre>
Same votes, shown here in different format.
<br>
<b>iii.</b>
<pre>
54: A>B>C
2:  A>C>|>B
C>A>B
3: A>|>B>C
</pre>
Rank-order votes with candidates named A,B,C.  The | symbol is an "approval threshold"
and if omitted then all candidates are considered approved by that voter.
In truncated ballots unmentioned candidates are regarded as ranked last 
and in random order (or co-equal last for some methods).
</p>
<p>
IEVS will report input errors and allow you to try again.
Don't use more than 30 candidates and 2000 voters.
