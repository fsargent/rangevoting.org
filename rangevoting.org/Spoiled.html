<H2> On "spoiled ballots" with Range and Approval (and old-style plurality) voting </H2>

<p>
<a href="SpoilExec.html">(Executive Summary)</a>
</p>

<p>
The issue of "spoiled ballots" &ndash; ballots that do not obey the rules of
the election system and which hence cannot be used &ndash; depends on
a lot of factors &ndash; not just the election system's mathematical definition,
but also how the election officials behave, what kind of voting machines they employ, and 
what settings they set their machines to.
</p>

<p>
For example in the critical Bush-versus-Gore presidential contest in Florida 2000,
it was known that Blacks were much more pro-Gore than Whites.
The Florida state governor was Bush's brother Jeb.  The
Florida state elections commissioner Katherine Harris was simultaneously
Bush's Florida campaign co-chair.
Sample voting machines
of the types used in each Florida county were on display outside governor Bush's office
before the election so the higher-ups could be sure they
had been adjusted right.
In heavily black counties and districts throughout Florida
the machines were intentionally adjusted to <i>silently reject</i>
invalid ballots.  In contrast, in White counties, and districts expected to be pro-Bush,
the machines were adjusted to <i>complain</i> to the voter about
invalid ballots, and offer the voter the chance to try again.
</p>

<p>
Result:
Sure enough, the rates of non-counting were considerably higher in the 4 blackest Florida
counties than in the 4 whitest (and the electronic
voting machines in Gadsden were known to have been
adjusted to silently reject invalid
ballots without any indication to the voter that it was happening):

Although only 11% of Floridians are black, it was claimed
in a speech in Congress on 21 Sept. 2004 that over half the state's invalid ballots appear
to have been cast by blacks, and indeed a report by the US Civil Rights commission
estimated that over half the 
invalid ballots <I>USA-wide</I> in 2000 appear to have been cast by blacks, even though blacks
are 12% of the USA population.
In 2004 in New Mexico, non-Anglo (Black, Mexican-American, and Native American) voters
cast at least 89% of the no-choice-counted-for-President ballots despite being
only about 55% of the population, i.e. an over 4&times; higher rate.  (Supposedly
21084 NM ballots "did not indicate any choice" for US president; Bush won the state
by 5988 over Kerry.)
 <small>
And nationwide data gathered by Harvard Law School Civil Rights Project again 
indicate that, of the 
2 million ballots spoiled in a typical presidential election, about <i>half</i> are cast by 
minority voters.  Cleveland State University Professor Mark Salling analyzed ballots 
thrown into Ohio's electoral garbage can in 2004. Salling found that, "overwhelmingly," the 
voided votes come from African-American precincts.

<a href="PalastAMcaption.html">with caption</a>.
Cornell University professor Walter Mebane Jr. analysed 
ballot-level data from the NORC Florida ballots project and ballot-image files,
and concluded that "overvoted ballots 
in the 2000 presidential election in Florida included more than 50,000 votes that
were intended to go to either Bush or Gore but instead were discarded. The primary reason for 
this  was defective election administration in the state, especially the failure to use 
systems that warn
the voter when there are too many marks on the ballot and allow the voter to make corrections.
If  the best type of vote tabulation system
used in the state in 2000 &ndash; precinct-tabulated optical scan 
ballots &ndash; 
had been used statewide then [due to inequities in the distribution
of voting machines &amp; settings of those machines]
<i>Gore would have won by more 
than 30,000 votes</i>."

</p>

<p>
This also jibes with the 
<i>Washington Post</i>'s analysis of the 2.7 million votes
cast in Florida's eight largest counties.
It found that Gore's name was punched on 46,000
of their over-vote ballots, while Bush's was marked on only 17,000.
(All over-voted ballots were discarded as illegal, so this discrepancy hurt Gore far more
than it hurt Bush.)
In the eight counties examined, people who overvoted for president but 
cast a valid vote in the U.S. Senate race favored the Democrat 70 to 24 percent.

<p>
To see that this kind of thing was happening not only at the county level,
but also at the level of individual districts, 
check this histogram [from the 
<a href="http://www.netrinsics.com/Duval/Duval.html">Netrinsics.com study</a>]
<!-- local copy: Duval.html -->
of the Bush-Gore 2000
results in all the 268 precincts in Duval County Florida
<!-- , available in either 
<a href="assets/documents/Duval2.pdf">pdf</a>,
<a href="assets/documents/Duval2.ps">ps (large file!)</a>, or
<a href="assets/images/Duval2.gif">gif</a> formats &ndash; 
-->
and notice the amazing
anti-correlation between the percentage
of "missing" (i.e. spoiled, hence left uncounted) ballots and the pro-Bush fraction in those
districts, with the most pro-Gore districts having an incredible
spoilage rate of over 20% of the ballots, while the most pro-Bush
districts had 3%.   A fluke result due to random fluctuations? I don't think so.
<small>The chance the two orderings &ndash; by missing-fraction and Bush-fraction &ndash; 
came out the same by luck, was 1/10!=0.000028%.  This would be expected to happen just once
every 4618 years among the 3143 counties in the USA,
assuming one presidential election every 4 years.  With a more sophisticated statistical analysis
the amazingness would grow by at least a further factor of 10.
</small>
Was this Duval-County-only effect large enough to swing the statewide
 Bush-Gore election result in Florida (which was decided by
an official margin of only 537 votes)?  Easily.

Heck, even the votes for Buchanan 
<i>accidentally</i> cast by more than 2000 Democratic voters in
Palm Beach County (due to the famous butterfly ballot foul-up)
would, if corrected, have been far more
than sufficient to swing the election from Bush to Gore.

Although generally speaking overvotes (e.g, votes for <i>both</i> Bush <i>and</i> Gore)
are useless due to ambiguity, that is not true of so-called "write-in overvotes."
One fact which has received near-zero media attention is that many of
the "overvotes" in Florida 2000 were of this kind, where e.g. voters both voted Gore <i>and</i>
wrote-in "Gore." Professor Lance deHaven-Smith writes (in Florida State University's
<i>Research in Review</i>  Magazine, concerning his
<a href="RVPapers.html">book</a>)
</p>

<blockquote>
If you look at where those votes occurred, they were in predominantly black precincts. 
And (when you look at) the history of black voting in Florida, these are people that 
have been disenfranchised, intimidated. 
In the history of the early 20th century, black votes would be thrown out on technicalities, 
like they would use an X instead of a check mark.
So you can understand why African Americans would be so careful, checking off Gore's
name on the list of candidates and also writing Gore's name in the space for write-in votes.
But because of the way the vote-counting machines work, this had the opposite effect: 
the machines threw out their ballots.
</blockquote>

<p>
In an email to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">daily kos</a>, deHaven-Smith summarizes:
</p>

<blockquote>
A number of studies have been conducted of the "spoiled ballots"
in Florida. 
The most thorough was by the National Opinion Research Center 
(<a href="http://www.norc.org/">NORC</a>) at the University of Chicago.
It examined all of the 175,010 spoiled ballots that were excluded from the vote tabulations.
Ballots were examined by multiple coders to assure reliability, and a dataset 
(available on NORC's website) was constructed that included each coder's
judgment on each ballot. 
NORC also provided a
program for applying different criteria and calculating the results.
If the most restrictive criteria are used, Gore's
margin of victory is 158 votes. 
By "most restrictive,"
I mean ballots are counted only if the voter's intention is totally unambiguous 
(no partially punched chads, no unclear write-ins, etc.).
[With less restrictive criteria the margin would be many thousands.]
<br>
Today, this would be widely recognized if NORC had published a report on its findings, but instead it chose simply to release the data and let everyone make sense of it on their own. My assumption is that NORC and the research sponsors did not issue a report because they did not want to embarrass President Bush. The study was concluded just after 9-11-01.

The same kind of amazing correlations also happened throughout
the critical state of Ohio in the 2004
Bush-Kerry election, where <i>again</i>, amazingly,
the Ohio Commissioner of Elections J.Kenneth Blackwell
just "coincidentally" happened simultaneously to be Bush's campaign chair.
[Many of these figures are extracted from the immense data collections
documenting Ohio election manipulation collected by Ph.D. statistician
<a href="http://web.northnet.org/minstrel/alpage.htm"> Richard Hayes Phillips</a>, as
well as from Ohio newspapers.]
E.g.:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
Summit County:</dt> 
<dd>
There were
exactly 71  precincts  with more than 3.0% of the ballots spoiled hence uncounted.
Kerry won 70 of these 71, by an aggregate ratio of about 4 to 1.
Meanwhile the countywide totals were
Kerry 156587,  Bush 118558.
</dd>
<dt>
Hamilton county:
</dt> 
<dd>
(Which includes Cincinnati) Bush won
with 222616 votes to Kerry's 199679.
There were exactly 26 precincts with more than 8% of the votes left uncounted.
Kerry overwhelmingly won all 26 of them, by an aggregate margin of 10 to 1.
</dd>
<dt>
Montgomery County:
</dt>
<dd>
Had exactly 588 precincts, and exactly
47 of them had more than 4.0% of the
regular ballots uncounted.
Kerry won every one of those 47 precincts, by an aggregate margin of 7 to 1.
The countywide official vote totals, meanwhile, were
142997 for Kerry and 138371 for Bush. 
In these 47 precincts the rate of ballot "spoilage" was
5.16%, compared to 1.31% for the rest of the county.
</dd>
<dt>
Allegheny County:
</dt>
<dd>
More voter complaints than any other county in the entire USA.
(In second place, not to be daunted: Broward County FL.)
Each polling place furnished with 12 (yes, twelve) provisional ballots.
</dd>
<dt>
Stark County:
</dt>
<dd>
There were exactly
28 precincts with more than 3.33% of the regular ballots
uncounted.  Kerry won all 28 precincts, by an aggregate margin of 2.7 to 1.
Meanwhile the countywide totals were
Kerry 95337, Bush 92215. 
</dd>
<dt>
Lucas County:
</dt>
<dd>
The 88  precincts with the lowest turnout all were won by Kerry by an aggregate
ratio of over
4.5 to 1.  All 88 were
in Toledo (which contains over 60% of the county population).
Meanwhile 21 of the 25 highest-turnout precincts in Toledo were won by Bush.
<br>
Chairing the Lucas County election Board was Bernadette Noe, who was simultaneously
Bush's campaign chair in that county.  She was married to Tom Noe,
who later pled guilty to money laundering charges and
continues to face massive fraud charges in "coingate" (in which Noe invested
$50 million of Illinois public worker's comp money  &ndash; he was the sole fund manager &ndash;
in rare coins sold by Noe's personal numismatics business,
then some coins mysteriously vanished... resulting in $13 million
in losses for the state fund.  Noe did this by paying multi-thousand-$ kickbacks
to others who also pled guilty, such as Terrence Gasper...).
In October 2004
the window in the Democratic Party Lucas office was smashed and
computers with sensitive election information were burglarized; 
other offices in the same building
were not entered, nor were less-sensitive Dem-party
computers or any of their petty cash taken, and everything was left neat and tidy,
suggesting run of the mill criminals were
not behind this.  ("They knew what they wanted" according to one witness quoted in 
the <i>Toledo Blade</i>.)
The thieves would then (especially if they were in communication
with Bernadette Noe) have been in a perfect position to try to suppress
votes in the areas the Dems liked the most, for example by moving polling places to unexpected new
high-crime areas, "forgetting" to designate voting machines in order to lengthen lines,
using defective machines, "accidentally" sending voters to wrong locations, etc
(all of these are complaints that were filed by voters in these 88 precincts).
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Obviously, most or all of these were not "flukes."  They were "pre-arranged" just like in Florida.
</p><p>
And on and on.  I have plenty more Ohio 04 data of this kind. 
<a href="Ohio04.html">More Ohio stories</a>.
Think those Ohio biases were just a sad, unintentional side effect of the fact that
poorer, blacker, too-stupid-to-vote-validly,
and more urban voters tend to vote Democratic?  Cornell
Professor Walter Mebane Jr.
doesn't agree.  He compared the distribution of voting machines 
in the Ohio 04 presidential election and the primary election held the previous spring.
They differed.
Amazingly enough, in the primary "there was no sign of racial bias in the distribution 
of the machines"
but when it came to the general election  in November, lo and behold,
"there was substantial bias with fewer voting machines per voter in areas that were 
heavily African-American." 
<small>
Mebane concluded his <a href="http://macht.arts.cornell.edu/wrm1/franklin2.pdf">study</a>
of Franklin County with
"The allocation of voting machines in Franklin County was clearly biased against voters 
in precincts
 with high proportions of African Americans when measured using the standard of 
the November, 2004, electorate.
The most conservative estimate... [is that this] reduced voter turnout by slightly 
more than 4% in precincts in which high proportions of the voters were African 
American, while shortages in precincts where very few voters were African American 
reduced voter turnout  by slightly less than 1.5%."
Essentially the same conclusions were reached in an independent study
using different methodology by
<a href="http://apsanet.org/imgtest/065-0681.pdf">Benjamin Highton</a> at UC-Davis.
Ohio statewide, African-American voters reported waiting
an average of 52 minutes in line to vote, compared to white 
voters' 18 minutes; but in Franklin County's
Columbus 55th ward, on the ground election protection volunteers clocked an average wait of 
3 hours 15 minutes.
The Franklin County Board of Elections, under the control of former Franklin County 
Republican Party Chair Matt Damschroder, failed to employ 76 voting 
machines (by his own admittance; the Democrats claimed 122) 
&ndash; <i>all</i> 76 from the Democrat-rich city of Columbus.
Damschroder and Blackwell met with Bush and Karl Rove on election day in Columbus Ohio
[reported sources to the <i>Free Press</i>].
The official story,
e.g, reported in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, was that Bush had flown to Columbus
that morning
from his home in Crawford Texas, in order that he could join phone bank members by
making a single phone call with them to a voter; then after that inspiring call,
Bush went back to the airport and flew
on to Washington DC.
</small>
</p>

<p>
I am not confident that the above distortions were large
enough to swing Ohio (and therefore the presidency)
from Kerry to Bush.  I am confident that they were in the same ballpark
as the amount required to do that.  This conclusion is also 
supported by the fact that
CNN (based on exit polls of 1963 Ohio voters) predicted slightly after midnight EST
that Kerry would  defeat Bush in Ohio by a margin of  4.2
percentage points, whereas the
official election results were that  Bush won Ohio by 2.5 percent. 
(More seriously, there was a countrywide discrepancy  of
the same sign as this, which was biggest in the critical states such as Ohio, Florida, and 
Pennsylvania.  CNN's exit polls after midnight predicted a countrywide popular-vote
victory for <i>Kerry</i> 51-to-48% based on 11027 respondents, 
but the official totals gave it to <i>Bush</i> by 50.7-to-49.1%.)
<small>
In November 2004,  Senator Richard Lugar(R), in Kiev, cited the gap between exit polls
and official results as solid evidence of "blatant fraud" in the  Ukraine election.
Hence the Bush administration refused to accept Ukraine's official vote total.
</small>
</p>

<p> 
And in the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential contest, most historians agree
that Kennedy won the state of Illinois
because of electoral fraud in Daley-controlled Chicago, and future US
president Lyndon Johnson got his start by winning a massively blatantly
fraudulent
Senatorial primary election in Texas
[e.g. see
<a href="RVPapers.html">Caro and Feinberg's books</a>].

<H3> Reduced spoilage under Range &amp; Approval voting? Our recommendations? </H3>

<p>
Theoretically, by using computerized machines that simply <i>refuse to accept invalid votes</i>
and demand the voter keep trying until his vote obeys the rules,
<i>any</i> voting system could be made spoilage-free.
Sounds simple to eliminate the problem, right?
</p>

<p>
But sadly, in reality, evil manipulators could always reprogram such machines to 
avoid complaining to voters
about invalid ballots, or just to commit blatant fraud by discarding or faking ballots.
</p>

<p>
It has been argued that with <a href="rangeVapp.html">approval voting</a>, 
(especially the version of AV where you are allowed to leave votes blank)
ballot spoilage is <i>impossible</i>
because every possible combination of approvals and disapprovals is
a legitimate vote.  (Unlike in the plurality system where, e.g.,
some combinations &ndash; such as voting for more than one candidate &ndash; are
illegal.)
</P>

<p>
That argument is however not really true because voters can always find some way to mangle their
ballot to render it unreadable by the machine, etc., so there will always be some spoilage rate.
</P>

<p>
With range voting, every possible combination of 2-digit range votes (including blanks)
is legitimate,
so again "ballot spoilage is impossible."  But again this is not really true
because of e.g, voters who wrote an unreadable digit.  In range voting with "blanks,"
which CRV recommends,
we could agree to treat
illegible digits as blanks in which case the ballot would not be spoiled.
</p>

<p>
Range and approval voting definitely do <i>not</i> cure the problem of election 
fraud and manipulation.  But they do
<a href="SPRates.html">reduce spoilage</a>.
</p>

<p>
And the problem of ballots "spoiled" by "accident" is
really hardly a problem at all (true accidents would tend to cancel out and lead to only
a very tiny
noise level) &ndash; the real problem is <i>intentional</i> manipulation as
in the examples above intended to create biases that do <i>not</i> cancel out.
</p>

<p>
And   a cure (or at least a partial cure) for that is to have 
<i>uniform national standards</i> for ballot "spoilage" and <i>not</i> to allow
individual districts and counties and states to make up their own each election.
For example,  immediate voter-notification of ballot non-validity, should be required
everywhere.  It is an <i>outrage</i>
that this still has not happened after over 200 years
of US history.
We strongly recommend that this be done as part of whatever <a href="BallInit.html">law</a>
enacts range voting.
</p>

<p>
But we think it is fair to say that ballot spoilage would be a <i>smaller</i> problem with range
and approval voting because  if your vote about candidate A is spoiled, then your votes
on all the other candidates still can be used, so  only part of your vote gets lost.
This is exactly the right thing to do &ndash; unreadable scores for a candidate are regarded as blanks
and not incorporated into his average.  (And of course, this policy should be
demanded by the uniform national standard.)
