and related areas, for those who really want to know.

(favorite-betrayal lesser-evil) situation in a random large IRV election 
is arccot(&radic;2)/&pi;&asymp;0.195913, albeit arguably 100%, and also
does a similar FBLE analysis for Condorcet voting.

<a href="RVstrat1.html">Unintuitive examples</a> where
approval-style range voting is <i>not</i> strategically optimal.
But these examples do not occur (i.e. the departure of the best approval-style vote
from optimality is negligible)
in large realistic elections in which 3-or-more-way lead-ties
(and near-ties) are regarded as negligibly unlikelier than 2-way lead-ties.
</li>
<li>
<a href="RVstrat2.html">Unintuitive examples</a> 
where <i>dishonest</I> approval-style range voting is strategically optimal.
But this cannot happen in 3-candidate elections, nor can the dishonesty
ever involve your favorite (or 
your most-hated) candidate.  
Also it in practice in 4- and 5-candidate elections seems rare and has small probabilistic 
effect.
