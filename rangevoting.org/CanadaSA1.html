<H2> Tentative suggestion for a voting system for electing the parliament of Canada, 1 </H2>

<p>
<small> Warren D. Smith, October 2015</small>
</p>

<p>
Here is one concrete tentative system suggestion for Canada.  I am putting it here
(/CanadaSA1.html) just to serve as a reference point for further discussion.
I obtained this system
by hybridizing 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> within ridings, with a new
"top-up" system based on Simmons' version of <a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>.
<small>If T=0 our proposal simplifies
to become <a href="CanadaSA5.html">pure score voting</a>
to elect MPs in ridings.
If T=W (which I would <i>not</i> recommend) it becomes pure asset voting countrywide.
</small>
This system is designed to resemble some current widely known ideas in Canada,
but which however fail to enjoy nearly as many good properties as our scheme.

<h3> Design goals </h3>

The <b>goal</b> is to elect a W-member parliament, from W-T ridings (0&le;T&le;W), in such
a way that:
<ol type="A">
<li>
The system has two stages. In the first stage,
exactly one MP is elected from each riding
(hopefully the one that riding considers the best available!);
call these the "local" MPs.
</li><li>
In the second stage, a further T  "top up"  MPs are elected countrywide
(call these the "top up" or "nonlocal" MPs)...
</li><li>
In such a way as to obtain or approach "<a href-="PropRep.html">proportionality</a>."*
</li><li>
The rules of the voting system in no way even mention or require
the existence of "parties,"   nor assume anything about the existence
or nature of "leaders" or "pecking orders" within those parties,  and thus hopefully in no
way inherently hurt independent candidates or nonconformist parties.
<small>
(That is important because PR countries 
&ndash; which future-Canada would become under this system &ndash;
usually have a lot of small parties, with independents as "parties of one" being the
extreme case of that.  E.g. the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_Netherlands#Parliamentary_parties#Parliamentary_parties"
>Netherlands</a>, with population about half Canada's,
as of year 2015 has 17 parties holding
seats.)</small>
</li><li>
System is simple.
</li><li>
The ballots are "ratings style" which allows voters to provide the
most possible information,  but also (if that voter desires) less.
</li><li>
The system is immune to "candidate <a href="CandCloneSumm.html">cloning</a>."*
</li><li>
It is never suboptimal strategy, for a voter to give her honestly
favorite candidate,   the max rating.*
</li><li>
It is never suboptimal strategy, for a voter to give her honestly
most-detested  candidate, the min rating.*
</li><li>
Not voting, is never a superior voting strategy than voting honestly
("participation property")*;
and raising a candidate's score on your ballot cannot hurt him*, 
while lowering it cannot help him* 
("<a href="Monotone.html">monotonicity</a> properties").
</li><li>
The system is "precinct countable," i.e. each precinct could publish
a compact table of "subtotals," in such a way that the whole
election process could be performed using only these precinct
subtotals tables as input.
</li></ol>

<p>
<b><big>*</big> More precise claims:</b></p>
<p>
<b>Proportionality theorem:</b> under a "party loyalty assumption" 
that candidates always prefer own-party colleagues over foreign-party candidates,
and if voters always give their own party's candidate the maximum rating and all other-party
candidates the minimum rating, <i>then</i> 
the final parliament will have the same party composition
&ndash; up to small errors forced by rounding to integers, and up to 
limitations which could sometimes be forced
by T being too small so that the top-up simply does not have enough seats to achieve
exact proportionality in cases where the first stage
provided a too-disproportional winner-set &ndash; as the electorate.
<blockquote>
<small>
Additional stronger claim: if voters give other-party candidates not necessarily
minimal, but merely submaximal,
ratings, then we still guarantee exact proportionality (based on top choices for
each voter only) <i>provided</i>
the "zeroing negative juice" substep inside step 5, does not occur, and provided
enough top-up seats are available to allow proportionality.
The zeroing problem arises for local MPs who won
because they are the favorite of few, but the 2nd-favorite of many. 
It can cause a party
containing many such "compromise" MPs to be somewhat over-represented.
All proportionality theorems ever proven for voting systems, necessarily make some
extreme partisan-behavior assumption of our ilk. (Specifically, ours was that all voters
score their party  MAX and all others MIN; we had proved our PR theorem under this assumption.)
Proportionality advocates
then have to hope that with more realistic voter behavior, their voting systems will 
actually elect <i>better</i> parliaments for their country 
than arise from the simpler-to-model extreme voter-behaviors. These "better"
parliaments might have greater proportionality-errors, but 
will enjoy other benefits hopefully more than compensating for that.
The point of a proportionality theorem is as a safety backstop.  It tends to prevent parliaments
from becoming too-poorly reflective of the electorate's composition.  No proportionality
theorem can always assure a perfect mirroring; and there usually is no way even to define
what that would even mean, or measure whether we have it.  (E.g, if you scored
the Liberal 8 and the Tory 6, does than mean you are 4/7 liberal and 3/7 Tory for purpose
of assessing your "composition"?)  The best that PR theorems can do is to assure that in
certain <i>crudely simplified circumstances</i> where it <i>is</i>
possible to clearly define what a
"perfect mirroring" would mean, it is achieved.
</small>
</blockquote><p>
<b>Cloneproofness, Participation, &amp; Monotonicity theorems:</b> Always valid for first stage.
These all also valid about the top-up stage provided we assume both party loyalty and a
"party sameness model" that all candidates from any one party are equivalent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
A scheme suggested to me by one Liberal MP was similar to ours except 
(i) involved the first stage instead done via <a href="IrvExec.html">Instant Runoff</a>
Voting (IRV),
and (ii) the second top-up stage via a party-list system.
That's worse because:
</p><p>
(i) IRV would cause the first stage to disobey
<a href="Monotone.html">monotonicity</a>, 
participation, and precinct 
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">countability</a>, 
and 
the <a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">favorite</a>-safe property H and its mirrored property I;
and would <i>force</i> voters who wish not to express an opinion about a candidate, to 
provide one (which, if they were ignorant, would just be forcing them to guess);
and would make everything more complicated.
</p><p>
(ii) Party-list based top-up would inherently kill independents, by law. 
One could counter-argue that
independent MPs have been neither very common nor very effective in Canada &ndash; but
in future-PR-Canada they would be more common. Independent thinking is very
important for making good decisions!  Should we kill it all, as a matter of <i>law</i>?!
Should we <i>mandate</i> the existence of political parties?  
And also, countries with such top-up systems have found it
necessary (to prevent "gaming the system") to, by law,
restrict the ability of MPs to change parties!  Should
we, as a matter of <i>law</i>, force MPs to stay in a party they dislike?
(That'd take "whipping" to a whole new level.  Remember, the ultimate cure for the disease of
too-whipped parties, is for unhappy MPs to be able to switch parties.)
I think not.  
</p><p>
So in my view, the scheme suggested here is similar in spirit to the one that MP
had in mind, but repairs many of its most severe disadvantages.  Also, given 
that Canada's Liberal Party seems likely often to be victimized by 
IRV's <a href="IrvCenterSqueeze.html">center squeeze</a> pathology, it may be
against the Liberal party's own interests to use IRV (i.e. that Liberal MP
would, by enacting his system, have risked hurting his own party as a nasty
unintended side effect!).
</p><p>
<b>Simplicity for voters:</b>
In the view of any voter, our proposal
is <a href="RangeVoting.html">simple</a>: 
just give the candidates ratings on an 0-9 numerical scale
(leaving some unrated if that is too difficult).  Done.
</p><p>
I don't mind if the candidates &ndash; they are pros usually with helpers &ndash;
have to work hard during election, but Amy The Average Voter must have it easy and simple.
</p>

<a name="RU"></a>
<h3> Rules of proposed voting system (on a single page) </h3>

<p>
I will regard voters as "female" and candidates as "male" just to make wording clearer.
<small>
Various numbers (2, 9, 1000, 3) in our description 
have been selected pretty
arbitrarily and could perfectly well be replaced by other numbers.  
And we could demand T=&lfloor;W/5&rfloor;,
where again "5" is a pretty arbitrary value. 
</small>
</p>
<!--
0. [Optional.] Each candidate in each riding receives 1000 scores of 2
before voting starts.
-->
<p><b>1.</b> 
Each voter rates each candidate in her riding, on an 0-to-9 numerical scale.
(Voters also allowed to leave some candidates unrated, if that voter
wishes not to express any opinion about that candidate.)
<small>Refinement suggested by J.Quinn: 
"Any voter who did not explicitly rate any candidates at 0 is considered to have given 0 to 
any candidates they left blank. Any voter who did rate at least one candidate explicitly at 0 
is considered to have expressed 'no opinion' about any candidates they left blank. 
(I think this rule is the safest way to interpret 'intent of the voter'.)"
</small>
</p><p><b>2.</b>
 In each riding, the candidate with the highest average score 
wins that riding's MP seat.
<small>Slight optional refinement: each candidate could receive 1000 artificial scores of 2
before voting begins.  Then the candidate with the highest average among both his 
genuine and artificial scores, wins.</small>
</p><blockquote>[At this point we have elected W-T of the W seats in Parliament,
each via the excellent 
&quot;<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>&quot;
single-winner system.  
The "top up" now commences, whose mission now is to fill the remaining T seats.]
</blockquote>
<p><b>4.</b>
Each voter is viewed as having given 1 cup of "juice" to her top-rated candidate.
(If a voter rates more than one candidate co-equal top, then her juice is
divided equally among them.)
Let J denote the total amount of juice.  (Which, note, equals the
total number of voters.)
</p>
<a name="step5"></a>
<p><b>5.</b>
Remove J/(W+1) cups of juice from each candidate who has already won a seat.
(<i>Except</i>: If this would cause that candidate now to have a negative amount of
juice, instead just give him zero.)
</p><a name="step6"></a><p><b>6.</b>
Candidates are now X'd off, one by one.  Always, the un-X'd candidate who currently
possesses the least juice is the one who is X'd.
Each time such a candidate is X'd, he may donate all or some of his juice to
some not-yet-Xd candidate (or candidates, plural, if he wishes to split it up) 
of his choice somewhere in Canada
within 3 minutes, otherwise his juice vanishes.   (As this process
proceeds, internet
should continually broadcast the amounts of juice currently possessed by all
candidates.  Any candidate worried that about his internet connection could pre-provide
instructions about how to disperse his juice in the event he is unreachable,
in the form "if I am X'd, then please give all my juice
to the first candidate on the following list eligible to accept it.")
</p><p><b>7.</b>
Keep doing step 6 until the number of "both not-yet-elected and
not-yet-Xd" candidates, shrinks to T.
</p><p><b>8.</b>
Those T candidates (the "juiciest" T) fill the remaining T seats.  The parliament has
now been fully chosen.
</p>

<h3> Criticisms (and responses, some of them good)  </h3>

<p><b>Simplicity criticism:</b>
The rules would be simpler to describe, if we eliminated steps 6,7,8 and replaced them with 
the single
</p><blockquote>
<b>6'.</b>
The juice-possessing candidates now negotiate, during which, some of them donate some or all of
their juice to others with the aid of an internet-based juice-tracking system.
The T juiciest as-yet-unelected candidates (at a pre-agreed deadline time) win the T top-up seats.
</blockquote>
<p><b>Response:</b>
This would indeed cause simpler rules, and I like simpler rules.  The only reason I suggested 6,7,8 instead of 6'
was I was afraid negotiations among this many people (&asymp;1000) might, if completely unstructured,
risk a logistical nightmare.  6,7,8 impose some structure to make everything more predictable.
Another idea would be to use 6,7,8 until the juice-possessing unelected
candidates had been winnowed down to 1.5T, then switch to unrestricted negotiations as in rule 6'.
</p>
<p><b>Proportionality criticism:</b>
The critic does not like the possibly-proportionality-damaging 
effect of the "zeroing negative juice"
exception-substep of step <a href="#step5">5</a>.
</p><p>
The critic realizes that: The whole "juice" <a href="Asset.html">mechanism</a>
was designed to force proportionality in a simple manner
while at the same time avoiding any explicit mention of "parties" in the rules, and 
also granting all candidates some freedom of action to try to mould
the parliament in ways that will improve it in their view.  There might well be
<i>negotiations</i> about juice transfers between candidates in the same (or different)
parties, which might allow
even candidates or parties 
who fail to win seats, still to influence policy in return for their juice.
This can
</p><ol type="a"><li>
yield a finer degree of "proportionality" than <i>any</i> PR method not involving such 
candidate-involvement,
</li><li>
tend to yield a more-harmonious parliament with less risk of "gridlock" because
the winners will become enriched 
with proven negotiators &amp; compromisers, and those the other MPs
appreciate.  (If Canada adopts a PR system such as ours, then majority-control
by a single party will become less common, and it will become
more common that "coalition governments" are needed, so gridlock will be more 
of a risk, so this feature will be very useful.)
This beneficial side-effect
also can tend to protect MPs their party-cohorts consider valuable 
(e.g. respected leaders) from losing their seat, which otherwise would have denied
Canada an MP widely considered useful.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><b>Response to that critic:</b>
The zeroing problem arises for local MPs who won
because they are the favorite of few, but the 2nd-favorite of many. 
It can cause a party
containing many such "compromise" MPs to be somewhat over-represented.
However:
in a riding in which Compromise Candidate Claude wins, he <i>is</i> the "favorite"
candidate of that riding, and therefore, in some reasonable approximate sense, of its
voters.  Therefore, if we were to steal juice from all of Claude's
rival (losing) candidates in that riding (say
stealing F fraction of each's juice) to give it to Claude to bring his negative juice up to zero
(F would have to be chosen just right in each riding to accomplish that)
then the net effect of such thefts would  
not constitute a horrible distortion.  They are just removing juice from individually-favorite
candidates to give it to a collective-favorite candidate, the collective effect
of which is not hugely distortionary.
And since this only happens when Claude is a <i>compromise</i> candidate, e.g. a Centrist
who here would be stealing juice from Leftists and Rightists, this theft is inherently less
distortionary than if, say, a Leftist was stealing juice from a Rightist.
So if, after we did all those thefts, the juice-mechanism proceeded normally
from then onward, we still would expect a not-horribly-distorted parliament.
</p><p>
So we've just argued that a certain modification of our proposal, involving "juice thefts,"
should, while imperfect, still work well.  But now, 
we argue that <i>doing nothing</i> (i.e. <i>no</i> such juice-thefts)
should be simpler and actually better!   Because:
the whole problem was Claude's Compromise Party getting <i>over</i>represented in parliament.
The juice-theft plan would actually 
amplify that problem by not only giving Claude extra juice, but also taking
it away from the rival parties.  So without juice-theft, just the negative-zeroing substep
of step 5 alone,
we should approximately halve the problem.
</p><p>
That argument has now
"proven" that our whole top-up proposal should perform decently about proportionality, 
in all circumstances, despite the so-called "zero-floor flaw" inside step 5.
The word "proven" is in quotes to indicate that this is not really a proof &ndash;
it's admittedly a somewhat flaky argument, which indeed my critic did not like &ndash;
but there nevertheless is a lot of truth in it.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Whipping criticism:</b>
The fact the candidates donate their juice is "horrible" because they will be "whipped" by evil
party bosses to do whatever those party bosses want!  Yikes!
</p><p><b>Response:</b>
This criticism is about as wrong as it could possibly be, for the following simple reason:
the vast majority of the donated juice is going to come from <i>losing</i> candidates who
are donating their juice as their last official act before vanishing!
It is hard for bosses to pressure anybody who's <i>leaving</i> government employ.
Furthermore, this pressure can work in both directions:  
MPs can influence who their bosses will <i>be</i>,
and who their colleagues will be, by <i>using</i> their juice.
</p><p><b>Logistical criticism:</b>
Steps 6-7 could be a logistical nightmare.  And what if the internet breaks, possibly
due to a cyberattack?  And what if it
doesn't break, but some candidate pretends that it did?
</p><p><b>Response:</b>
First, we expect future-Canada will have better internet than now.
Second, television could be used as emergency backup if the internet breaks.
Third, we've also proposed (in step <a href="#step6">6</a>)
an emergency backstop measure involving juice-transfer priority lists,
that could be used even if all communication broke down (and obviously
<i>any</i> election scheme is going
have trouble if all communication breaks).
Fourth, the main logistical problem we actually expect is related to the X-ing 
ordering in step 6.   There will  come a time when we ask 
"who do we X-off next: Joe or Tom?"
And then it will be a near-tie.  And then the entire country will
stall until every last vote is precision-counted in a major lawsuit nightmare,
just to get past that point.
I.e, the problem is, the system is vulnerable to near-ties of this kind causing a
stall, and there are a huge number of opportunities for them to arise.
</p><p>
However, there is a simple and effective workaround:
Allow the  election authority
(EA), whenever Joe and Tom are within 0.5% of each other,
to just order them wrong in any way it
likes.  Well, more precisely, it has to order them according to
whatever it thinks the vote counts are, but Joe is not allowed to complain
unless they were
more than 0.5% wrong.  
(That may allow the EA to be slightly evil, but live with that.)
</p><p>
Note the whole top-up stage will be unable to start until everybody is
nailed down
to better than 0.5% accuracy.
Also, even if future Canada will somehow be able to attain the 0.5% accuracy instantly,
then still there will be a long delay while all the very-low-juice fringe candidates
(who will have very little effect on the final result) perform their donations.
My point is, these initial delays will give all
the candidates plenty of time to scheme and plan their juice-transfer
strategies well ahead of time based on preliminary counts;
but thanks to the "0.5% fuzz" workaround, there should be no stalls thereafter.
</p><p><b>"Fake MP" corruption criticism:</b>
To understand this criticism, you
have to know that a form of corruption which has occurred in Canada is the "fake shadow MP."
That is, the official MP from some riding has little power because he
is in an opposition party.  That can allow a fake unelected MP from the
governing party to, because he has the right friends, effectively have more power
than the real MP.  So, if he wants, he could
run around telling people he is "the shadow MP"
for his riding, and that he, not the official MP, is the guy
to go to for funding and problem solving.  Then later, hope to really get elected.
(In the USA, this happens too, except in this
different flavor: they do not call it a "shadow MP," 
they call it "retiring from congress to become a big-money lobbyist.")
</p><p>
Now (the critic continues) with our proposed system some ridings
will actually have <i>two</i> MPs (if one was a top-up) and if those two
are from the opposition and governing parties, then the latter can
proclaim he is the "real" MP with all the power, while his colleague is 
useless, so don't bother going to that joker for funding and problem solving.  
This is just like the fake MP problem, except likely worse because he's
real, not fake!
Also, the critic dislikes the fact some ridings will have two not one MP, which 
could have a geographically-unfair effect.
</p><p><b>Response:</b>
These problems actually will happen not only with our system, but indeed with <i>any</i>
riding-based system trying to achieve PR via "top up" schemes.  
I.e, sorry, they are unavoidable. 
We can proclaim that the top-up MPs are "nonlocal" i.e. do not represent any riding 
&ndash; they were not elected by their riding, but really by slight effects from 
the whole rest of Canada &ndash; but if those
MPs disobey that proclamation, then the critic's problem arises!
</p><p>
This critic suggested a partial <a href="#regionalmod">fix</a> for his own problem.
Regard the top-up MPs as representing multi-riding regions.
Then they <i>will</i> have official local roles, but the region involved 
will be larger than just one riding.  (We indeed could design 
some kind of hierarchical division of Canada into ridings, 
coarser-grained super-ridings, etc, and my critic wondered if a system that did that 
could be better...)
</p><p>
But all that is at best 
only a <i>partial</i> fix because any such MP still will have motivation to focus
on his home riding to try to prepare for a future in which he might be elected
from it later as a local MP &ndash; and also just because he lives there.
</p><p>
So this criticism seems nasty and largely uncurable.
The only solution I can see is to entirely abandon "top-up" approaches,
at considerable cost in simplicity.  But even if that were done, I believe the problem
still would arise in an altered form.  For example, if each riding
elected 5 MPs (emulating Ireland's PR system) then the MPs who were in the governing party
could announce they were "real" while their colleagues in the same riding from opposition
parties were "useless."  And even if we devised a PR scheme with exactly one MP per riding
(which <a href="OptimumPartyAssign.html">can</a> be done, although only by forcing some ridings to elect an MP
whom they very much do not want) even then ridings <i>still</i> would get effectively highly
unfair representation, since the MPs from the majority party would have more power
while the ridings with opposition MPs would suffer.
</p><p>
There is, however, one saving grace (which is so good it may pretty much nullify this whole criticism):
in future-PR-Canada, majority control of parliament by <i>one</i> party would become rarer,
and coalition governments necessarily more common.  That in turn will diminish
all of those problems.  It is even possible, perhaps, that the net effect would
be that our new system actually is an <i>improvement</i> in this respect!
That question is hard to answer since it is hard to predict the future, but
this guess certainly seems possible.
</p>
<a name="weakenmsg"></a>
<p><b>Criticisms of the whole juice-transfer PR approach:</b>
Will MPs try to be nice to those from other parties so that the "juice transfers"
at the next election will be favourable? 
I doubt it &ndash; I think the parties will just do deals 
(like: we'll transfer votes to you in one riding, you transfer to us in another, 
then we will form a coalition government and give patronage appointments to all the 
defeated candidates from our parties). Voters will feel like they are being left out
if that happens, and they may feel the elected parliament is less legitimate.
</p><p>
Candidates also will be loathe to say, during the election campaign, 
who they would transfer their juice to. 
You are just weakening your campaign message if you talk like that. 
But in a juice-transfer (&quot;<a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>&quot;)
system, that is exactly what voters will want to know before they vote!
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
The whole "patronage appointment" thing is a form of corruption, or abuse of power,
which can happen regardless of voting system, but perhaps asset voting would worsen it.
On the other hand it could be argued that whenever such inter-party deals are made, that
is good, in the sense that some party which (in terms of the votes for it) deserves power
but would under prior voting systems lose it, now would effectively regain power via these
deals.  In other words, the deals may sometimes have a bad smell, but they necessarily
will tend to act in the right direction as far as restoring power balances is concerned.
</p><p>
I had wanted to respond that inter-party dealmaking  would be hindered because
most of the juice-donors
are <i>losing</i> candidates, whom, therefore, the party bosses cannot boss very well.
But the patronage-appointment criticism would hurt that response!
</p><p>
And to respond to the "loathe to say" critique, we could overcome that to a considerable extent
by demanding all candidates
<i>pre-specify</i> juice-transfer priority lists (recall them from step <a href="#step6">6</a>;
these were planned to be used
as an emergency backup measure in case that candidate's internet connection failed). 
</p>
<p><b>"I like PR less or more than you do" criticism:</b>
Proportional representation versus single winners &ndash; which is the better way
to run the world?  This is a debate that has continued for at least 100 years with
no conclusion.  The critic may not like our proposal above since he regards it as too far to
one side or the other of that debate.
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
The <i>ideal</i> of PR is that if the parliament were
to exactly mirror the demographics of the population in every way, then every decision the
parliament made, would be the same as the whole population would have made in a
(usually impractical) countrywide referendum.
So everything will be as good as it could hope to be.
That's an excellent ideal.
But the <i>reality</i> is that every PR country that has so far existed, has elected
parliaments that usually massively <i>fail</i> to mirror 
the population with respect to, e.g. gender, economic situation, and life-experience, education &amp;
expertise in varied areas.
The best PR so far has ever managed to do
is to mirror "party identification" counts, which is a very
crude kind of mirror.  
</p><p>
So in view of this, I do not advocate "too much" PR. Do not overdo it trying
to chase the will-o'-the-wisp of PR "perfection" &ndash; that would be pointless.
Instead I advocate using PR proportionality theorems merely as "safety backstops"
to prevent parliament from becoming too distorted a reflection of the population,
<a href="CanadaSeatsVotes.html">such</a> as Canada 2008 entirely giving the Greens zero seats.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the (unfortunately conflicting) <i>ideal</i> of non-PR "single winner" elections is 
maximizing individual accountability and quality.  Each MP is elected by 1 district, maximizing
simplicity, voter&harr;candidate mutual knowledge, and clarity,
and hopefully assuring that MP the best choice available (at least if a good-quality 
single-winner voting system were used &ndash; Canada's
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> system is a horribly bad way to try to
determine who that best option is, 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> or
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> would clearly be superior).
</p><p>
That also is an excellent ideal, but in reality it can (and many times in
Canadian history has) yielded highly disproportional parliaments and shut
important views out of power entirely.
</p><p>
The nice thing about our proposal is that it is <i>tuneable</i> to seek the
optimum tradeoff between these two ideals.
The designer can vary the fraction T/W of top-up seats;
making T larger causes better PR but at the cost of having fewer directly elected seats.
I suspect, based partly on 
<a href="CanadaSeatsVotes.html">data</a> and partly on extrapolation, that
 the optimum tradeoff will be reached when T is about 15-25% of W, i.e.
15-25% of the parliament is top-up seats.

<h3> Possible modifications </h3>

<p><b>1.</b>
If one wanted the top-up MPs to be "regional" rather than "Canada-wide" then use
the same proposal, just within
regions only.  For example if each region were 1/25 of Canada, 
then use our system to elect 1/25 of
the parliament, doing that independently within each region; then finally combine
all 25 subparliaments to obtain the whole parliament.
This would sacrifice some proportionality-accuracy, but hopefully the
advantages of greater MP regional identification would  outweigh those disadvantages,
at least if it is "tuned" optimally (i.e. by adjusting the number "25" to get
the optimal tradeoff).
</p><a name="rain"></a><p>
Whether or not you buy the 
whole idea that "regional" MPs are inherently more motivated or better than
"nationwide 'at large' MPs" the regional scheme still enjoys the following important
advantage.  Suppose that party composition is highly correlated with geography,
e.g. "the Liberals all are located in the East."
Now suppose it rains in the East on election day, depressing turnout.
With nationwide PR schemes, Canada would then artificially suffer a disproportionately
low-liberal parliament, purely because it happened to rain on that day.
(Or if it rained in the West instead, then the opposite problem.)
With regional top-ups, and each region's number of MPs based on its
population (not its <i>voting</i> population), that problem is avoided.
</p><p>
<p><b>2.</b>
Suggested (in essence) by professor S.J. Brams:
replace score voting by <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting,
using an "approval plus one favorite" style ballots where each voter <i>approves</i>(score 1) or 
<i>disapproves</i>(score 0) every candidate (intermediate scores forbidden)
and also designates one <i>favorite</i> among her approved candidates.  
All that voter's juice goes to her favorite.
</p;>
<p>
Approval is simpler than score, but 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/RateScaleReearch.html">surveys</a>
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">show</a>
people nevertheless prefer score, and score is <a href="rangeVapp.html">better</a>
both in principle and in tests.
</p>
<p><b>3.</b>
Elect a "weighted parliament" in which the MPs are not all equal.  They each
have a "voting weight" equal to their amount of "juice" when they were elected.
</p><p><b>Pros for weighting:</b>
</p><ul><li>
Each candidate has an incentive to maximize his vote share (e.g. by broadening his base of 
support).  
</li><li>
Even "abstention" is politically meaningful: it denies any candidate
the weight they would receive from your vote.
That all is good since then, politicians would not benefit (in fact, generally would be
harmed) by policies which alienate voters and lower voter turnout, e.g. the
"vote suppression" tactics unfortunately currently practiced in USA politics.
</li><li>
The distribution of power in Parliament would be exactly proportional 
to the distribution of public opinion. (So if 15% of 
voters voted for, say, libertarian candidates, then about 15% of the voting weight 
in Parliament will be controlled by libertarian candidates.)
This would be true to a greater degree of exactness than is possible with old-style
unweighted parliaments suffering "round to integer" effects.
And note this would happen without mentioning "parties" &ndash; i.e.
it would work just as well if each of the candidates ran as an "independent."
</li></ul>
<p><b>Cons for weighting:</b>
Weighted parliaments obviously are more complicated logistically &ndash; both for conducting
votes, and also other issues arise (e.g. should the MPs be paid unequally and have unequal staff?).
But if the parliament is equipped with an instant
computerized voting system (which many or all do, nowadays) that <i>might</i> be no
obstacle.  Also the whole "rains in the East" problem pointed out above,
is another good objection to weighting seats.
