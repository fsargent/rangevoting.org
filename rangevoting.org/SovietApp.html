<h2> Soviet use of approval voting </h2>

<p>
<a href="Approval.html">Approval voting</a> was widely used in
an experiment with introducing democracy in the Soviet Union
started by M.S.Gorbachev.
On 21 June 1987,
elections were held in approximately 5% of all the USSR's 50,000
villages, towns, cities, and counties;
making this by far the largest political approval voting
elections ever conducted (up to the year 2000 anyhow).
However, the
experiment did not last long because the USSR collapsed a few years
after they began it!
</p>
These were genuine elections (don't
be misled by my word "experiment")
and they were <i>genuine</i> approval-voting elections (not a variant form like
in the <a href="EarlyUS.html">early USA</a>) although
<i>psychologically</i> different because they expressed 
it as "disapproval" rather than "approval" voting.

This is about how Estonia allowed "non communist front" to form
(opposition party, 60K active members) and they were allowed to
participate in the June 1987 AV elections. Again this regarded
by top leaders as experiment in democratization.
