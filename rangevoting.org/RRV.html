Reweighted Range Voting &ndash;
a <a href="PropRep.html">Proportional Representation</a>
voting method that feels like range voting
</H2>

<p>

By Jan Kok &amp; Warren D.Smith.
(There is also an easier-to-digest[?] <a href="RRVr.html">RRV page</a> by Ivan Ryan.)
</small>
</p>

<P>
Reweighted Range Voting (RRV)
is based on STV (it uses the STV ideas of "Droop quota" and "ballot
reweighting"), and chooses multiple winners in such a way as to obtain
proportional representation. The main differences between RRV and STV
that would be apparent to ordinary people are: 
<ol>
<li>
RRV uses a more-expressive <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range-Voting</a>-style 
ballot &ndash; voters "score" each candidate from (say) 0=bad to 9=good &ndash;
while STV uses rank-order ballots in which expressing "strength of preference"
is impossible;
</li><li>
It is simpler to explain how RRV works.
</li></ol>

<h3> How RRV works </h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>
Each ballot is given an initial "weight" of 1.
</li><li>
The weighted scores on the ballots are summed for each candidate,
thus obtaining that candidate's total score.
</li><li>
The candidate with the highest total score (who has not already
won) is declared a winner. 
(Note that the first winner in RRV is the
same as the winner of an ordinary single-winner Range Voting
election using the same  ballots.)
</li><li>
When a voter "gets her way" in the sense that a candidate she rated
highly wins, her ballot weight should be <i>reduced</i> so that she has less
influence on later choices of winners. To accomplish that, each ballot is given a
new <nobr>weight = 1/(1+SUM/MAX),</nobr> where SUM is the sum of the scores 
that ballot gives 
to the winners-so-far, while MAX is the maximum allowed score
(e.g. MAX=99 if allowed scores are in the range 0 to 99).
</li><li>
Repeat steps b-d until the desired number of winners has
been chosen.
</li></ol>

<blockquote>
<small>
One can instead employ this formula in step d:
&nbsp;
weight = K / (K + SUM/MAX)
&nbsp;
where K is any positive constant.  The range 
&frac12;&le;K&le;1 seems most interesting.
Our formula above had used K=1, which is analogous to Jefferson &amp; d'Hondt notions
of proportionality, which tend to favor large political parties (incentivizes smaller
parties to merge); meanwhile
K=&frac12; 
is analogous to Webster &amp; Sainte-Lagu&euml; notions, which tend to be "fairer" and provide
much smaller merge-incentive (and perhaps not even of the same sign, it might be a slight 
split-incentive).
<br><br>
We also remark that votes incorporating "no opinion" scores on candidates could also be allowed.
Ballots employing them will not affect the weighted-average scores for any candidates
they rate with "no opinion" and such ballots will not be re-weighted when such
a candidate wins.
</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond RRV's
obvious simplicity advantage, it has other advantages such as
<a href=" Monotone.html">monotonicity</a>.  That is, with RRV, if a voter 
increases a rating for a candidate,
that will never change that candidate from a winner to a loser. 
(With
STV, giving a candidate a better rank can cause that candidate to
<a href="COlecture.html#nonmono">lose</a>, 
even in the single-winner [<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>] case.)
</p>
<p>
You may be thinking, "STV is good enough, why should we consider
another PR method?" One good reason to think about RRV
has to do with single-winner methods.
<p>
</p>
RRV is a <a href="PropRep.html">PR</a> method that
doesn't require <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> as a stepping stone. Rather, it uses
 <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> (also called "score voting")
as the stepping stone; i.e. score voting is the corresponding
single-winner method.
</p>

???You might want to come up with a simple example to illustrate the
point about monotonicity.

<h3> Proportionality Theorem </h3>
<p>
If some voter faction (call them the "Reds"),
consisting of a fraction F (where 0&le;F&lt;1) of the voters, 
wants to, it is capable (regardless of what the other voters do) of electing at
least
&lfloor;(1+N)F<sup>-</sup>&rfloor;  
red winners (assuming, of course, that at least this many red candidates run, and the total
number of winners is to be N).
</p>
<p>
Specifically, it can accomplish that by voting MAX for all Reds and MIN for everybody else.
</p>
<p>
To say that again: if 37% of the voters are reds, they can assure at least about 37% red winners
(up to rounding-to-integers effects).

<a name="history"></a>
<h3> History </h3>
<p>
Although I believed I was the inventor of RRV in 2004, it turns out that 
Thorvald N. Thiele invented a
special case of this system &ndash; namely where the only
allowed scores are 0 and 1 (<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style voting)
and with K=1 &ndash; in 1895.  Thiele's system actually was <i>used</i>
in Sweden in about 1910 (enacted 1907), but attributed to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Petersson">Alfred Petersson</a>
of P&aring;doba,
a prominent MP (and at least at one time a member of the Liberal party, although I do not know 
what party he was in at the time he proposed this) and wealthy farmer.  
I would like to know more about what happened 
during this period of RRV use and why Sweden abandoned it in 1921 to replace it by a
cruder "party list" PR system.
A scholar could probably understand that by reading old Swedish government documents.
I, however, am not that good a scholar and therefore resorted to reading books and papers
about Sweden written in English.  The closest I found to an explanation for its abandonment
was the following rather mysterious sentence:
</p><blockquote>
The regulations adopted in 1907
were found to be technically unsatisfactory, and so various changes
have been made in the method of election and particularly in the
technical aspects of the system.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;
Nils Herlitz: <a href="assets/documents/Herlitz1925PrSweden.pdf">Proportional Representation in Sweden</a>,
American Political Science Review 19,3 (Aug 1925) 582-592.
(English translation by Fred Berquist &amp; Clarence A. Berdahl.)
</blockquote><p>
<a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Herlitz">Herlitz</a>
was a law/history professor at University of Stockholm, and by 1925
Sweden had switched to a party list system within multiwinner districts, instituted universal
suffrage including for women, and become generally more democratic and
more PR all over.  What did Herlitz's sentence mean?
My guess is it just meant that Thiele was a lot more difficult
to count than party list PR systems.
It (like STV) needs to be counted <i>centrally</i>; we cannot
just use subtotal tables from precincts.   And Thiele requires multiple counting passes, with
different ballot weights, not
just one.  In the pre-computer era all that was a considerable burden.
As far as the election <i>results</i> they produced are concerned, my reading did not uncover
any commentator complaints about either Thiele or its party-list replacement.  Both generated
multiparty parliaments which tended mainly to yield "coalition governments"; and the number
of parties in Sweden tended to increase over time.
</p><p>
Thiele's system was criticized by Lars Edvald Phragmen and Nore B. Tenow;
<a href="Phragmen.html">learn more</a>.
And indeed the Thiele-like system Sweden enacted in 1907
(described in English by J.H.Humphreys in this <a href="assets/documents/Swedish1909.txt">excerpt</a> 
from his 1911 book) actually incorporated a <i>modification</i> designed
to repair the most important such criticism. Specifically, for j=1,2,3,...
while this keeps working:
if more than j/(j+1)
fraction of the voters have approved all members of a set of j candidates, then 
the top-approved such set is elected.  (For example if the top 2 candidates are
both approved on at least a fraction 2/3 of the ballots, then they win seats.)
Only <i>after</i> these "easy call" candidates had been
elected, did Sweden begin the Thiele process, and it was used to allocate 
only the remaining unfilled seats &ndash; and therefore only they obeyed
a proportionality theorem.

<h3> Imperfections </h3>
<p>
While RRV seems superior to STV both in simplicity and properties,
that is <b>not</b> to say that it is perfect.  Two flaws in RRV
(which also are flaws in STV) are
<ol>
<li>
a multiwinner analogue of "participation failure,"
and 
</li><li>
the fact that it <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">cannot</a> be "counted in precincts" but
only centrally.  
<BR>
<small>
<a href="FWS.html">Forest Simmons</a> in 2007 solved an open problem by showing
how to design PR multiwinner voting methods that <i>are</i>
countable in precincts &ndash; see <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p15">puzzle 15</a> &ndash;
but that is another story for another day.
</small>
</li></ol>

<a name="particfail"></a>
<p>
To explain the former:
here is a desirable-sounding property for
multiwinner voting systems:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ccffcc"><tr><td>
<blockquote>
<b>Multiwinner "participation property":</b><br>
By casting an honest vote, you cannot cause X to be elected
instead of Q (with all other winners staying the same)
if you prefer Q over X.
</blockquote>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
The "STV" system used in Ireland and Australia definitely fails this property, 
since its single-winner special case (<a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting</a>, IRV) 
<a href="IRVpartic.html">fails</a> it.
</p><p>
What about our new RRV system?  It obeys this property in the single-winner
case (because that is just range voting).
<i>But</i> it fails it in the following
140-voter 3-candidate 2-winner election example:
</p>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>Z=99, X=42, Q=0</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>X=99, Q=43, Z=0</td></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>Q=99, Z=53, X=0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In the first round, 
the totals are 
Z=7070,
X=7050,
and 
Q=6110,
so
RRV <b>elects Z</b>.
That deweights X so that,
second round, <b>Q wins.</b>
(The second round totals are
Q=6110,
and
X=6000.)
</p>
<p>
Now you (an extra voter) come with a vote Q>X>Z, for example
<blockquote>
Q=99, X=77, Z=0.
</blockquote>
That makes <b>X win</b> the first round.
(First round totals: 
X=7127,
Z=7070,
and
Q=6209.)
But that win heavily deweights Q, allowing
<b>Z to win</b> the second round.
(Second round totals:
Z=5134,
Q=5059.8.)
</p>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="aqua">
<caption>Summary of situation:</caption>
<tr><td>Before you vote:</td><td align="right">Z &amp; Q win.</td></tr>
<tr><td>After your Q>X>Z vote:</td><td align="right">Z &amp; X win.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The property fails.
</p>
<!-- NOT SO!  Psi voting obeys multiwinner participation property!!
<p><small>
It turns out however, that I can argue that <i>every</I> 
proportional representation voting method
<i>must</i> fail a property of this ilk; we shall hopefully explain that in a 
to-be-written future web page.

<h3> The OSCARs </h3>
<p>
RRV is now used by the <a href="OscarPapers.html">OSCAR</a>s 
to select the 5 nominees for "Best Visual Effects" award
for movies each year, according to this rule
<blockquote>
"Five productions shall be selected using reweighted range voting to 
become the nominations for final voting for the Visual Effects Award."
</blockquote>
from
<a href="http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule22.html">http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule22.html</a>.
They use an 0-10 scale for ratings.
Voting for the OSCARs is run by the accounting firm 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  [Presumably, this was done as an experiment with the idea of switching other
OSCAR categories to use RRV if it worked out well.]
The apparently first time (2013) they employed this system, the 5 nominees were:
</p>
<ul><li>
<i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i>,
Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, David Clayton and R. Christopher White
</li><li>
<i>Life of Pi</i>,
Bill Westenhofer, Guillaume Rocheron, Erik-Jan De Boer and Donald R. Elliott
</li><li>
<i>Marvel's The Avengers</i>,
Janek Sirrs, Jeff White, Guy Williams and Dan Sudick
</li><li>
<i>Prometheus</i>,
Richard Stammers, Trevor Wood, Charley Henley and Martin Hill
</li><li>
<i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>,
Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, Philip Brennan, Neil Corbould and Michael Dawson.
</ul>
<p>
Published <b>pre-election predictions</b>
included:
</p>
<ul><li>
<tt>IndieWire.com</tt> (and hence <tt>IMDb</tt>) predicted the
same five except they predicted that <i>Cloud Atlas</i> would be nominated instead of 
<i>Snow White</i>.  
</li><li>
<tt>Awardscircuit.com</tt> had predicted the same thing as <tt>Indiewire</tt>
except preferring <i>Skyfall</i> instead of <i>Avengers</i>.
</li><li>
<tt>Ropeofsilicon.com</tt> predicted the exact winning five.
</li></ul>
<p>
The difference between the actual winning 5 from RRV versus these predictions
indicates (Shentrup speculates) that RRV succeeded in thus-getting more <i>diverse</i>
nominees, thus demonstrating "proportional representation" in action.

<p>
An example election
where <a href="PRcond.html">RRV seems to greatly outperform PR-STV</a>.
</p><p>
A real-world high stakes 
<a href="assets/documents/June2011RealWorldRRVvotes.txt">election</a>
with 9 winners and 39 voters that was carried out with RRV
(you will need to view it with wide window).
</p><p>
Billy Tetrud writes a 
<a href="multiWinnerBaysianRegret.html">simulator</a>
which seems to indicate 
that RRV outperforms STV.
Indeed STV is outperformed by various <i>non-PR</i>
multiwinner methods!  That seems fairly damning
(to whatever extent Tetrud's simulator is valid).
