<H2>  Borda Count voting system (Executive summary) </H2>
<blockquote>
<b>Borda system:</b>
Each vote is an ordering of the N candidates from best to worst. 
(Voters are not allowed to omit a candidate they know nothing about, and are 
not allowed to regard two candidates as equal.) 
The top ranked candidate gets a score of N-1, the bottom ranked 0, and more generally the 
Kth-ranked gets a score of N-K. All scores are summed and the candidate with the 
highest total score wins.

<li>
Range voting offers more expressivity to voters than Borda voting.
</li>
<li>
Range voting can be done on regular 
plurality-style <a href="VotMach.html">voting machines</a> &ndash; Borda cannot
<!--
(Well, maybe it can &ndash; depends what you are willing to put up with as the 
number of candidates vary?  How to detect errors?)
-->
</li>
<li>
Range voting is simpler than Borda voting.
</li>
<li>
Borda <i>commonly</i> exhibits <a href="https://rangevoting.org/DGH3.html">horrible</a> 
pathologies such as electing the candidate 
<i>unanimously</i> agreed to be <i>worst</i>, if voters act "strategically."
But range voting reacts only mildly to strategic voting.
</li><li>
Similar pathologies <a href="FunnyElections.html#kiri91">happened</a> immediately
in the only government (Kiribati) ever to employ Borda voting.
Therefore Kiribati abandoned Borda voting.
</li><li>
The withdrawal of a seemingly-irrelevant loser
candidate from the race, can cause the Borda election results to
<a href="rangeVborda.html#JohnsonEx">reverse</a>, but
such a withdrawal has <i>no effect</i> on a range voting election.
</li>
