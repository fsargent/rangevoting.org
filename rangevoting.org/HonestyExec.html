<H2> Range voting encourages honesty (executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="GibbSat.html">Theorem</a>:
In essentially <i>every</i> voting system based on<i> rank-order</i> ballots, there is always a 
3-candidate election situation (<a href="IncentToExagg.html">example</a>)
where casting a  vote that dishonestly says A>B when you honestly feel B>A,
is strategically better than casting an honest vote.
</li><li>
Contrasting Theorem:
But in range voting, that never happens &ndash; being dishonest in this way 
never pays in 3-candidate elections.
</li><li>
Another theorem: 
In range voting, it also never pays to "betray your favorite" by giving him anything 
other than the top score.   (Sounds simple, but this unfortunately is 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">not true</a> in many other voting systems,
including 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
and
<a href="IRVcs.html">IRV</a>.)
</li><li>
So range voting encourages honesty in 3-candidate elections better than <i>every</i>
system based on rank-order ballots.
</li><li>
Experimental fact:
In the  USA's 2000 presidential
election, voters who thought Nader best were urged not to be strategically
stupid and instead to vote (dishonestly) for either Gore or Bush, and
polls showed that about 90% of the voters who thought
Nader was best in fact <i>did</i> vote
for somebody else.
[Another, different sort, of example &ndash; from p.65 of 
<a href="RVPapers.html">Lakeman &amp; Lambert's book</a>:
a 1950 Gallup poll showed 38% of British voters wanted to vote Liberal but
only 9% did.]
</li><li>
Experimental fact:
In the  USA's 2004 presidential
election, 
about 3/4 of <i>range voters</i> (in a range voting exit poll of random voters)
chose to vote in a style which did <i>not</i> 
award the max (99), min (0), or X (intentional blank)
score to every candidate.  In other words the fraction of range voters who choose
to sacrifice some strategic oomph in order to be more honest, 
experimentally is enormous.
</li><li>
The consequences of greater voter honesty are huge &ndash; check out the
<a href="PsEl04.html">enormous experimental differences</a>
between the vote totals for the third-party candidates 
under range, versus under approval and plurality voting.
</li><li>
And even when voters <i>do</i> choose to vote strategically in range voting, the
consequences are mild, even pleasant:
<a href="PleasantSurprise.html">Maximizes "pleasant surprise"</a>,
<a href="AppCW.html">Victory for the (honest voter) "beats-all winner"</a>.
(Try to find another voting system with such pleasant provable properties under strategic 
voting, I dare you.)
</li><li>
There is a <a href="HonStrat.html">good reason to believe</a> that
range voters will be both honest and strategic (both in large fractions)  as far
as the eye can see 100 years into the future with range voting.
A 50-50 mix is probably a good rule of thumb.
