<H1>PR vs. Single-Member Districts in 
States</H1>
<H2>Testimony before the California State 
Legislature</H2>
<H4> <a href="http://polisci.ucsd.edu/faculty/lijphart.htm">Arend Lijphart</a> </H4>
</CENTER>
<P><I>In 1995, the California state legislature held hearings on a 
proposal to amend the state constitution to change from a 
gubernatorial system to a parliamentary system.  On March 8, 
1995, Arend Lijphart testified before the Senate Committee on 
Constitutional Amendments and argued that the proposal for a 
parliamentary system could be greatly improve by adding a 
provision to elect legislators by proportional representation.

<P>
I very much appreciate the invitation to appear before your 
committee today.  I have devoted a major part of my professional 
career to the study of democratic institutions, and I believe 
that the two most important institutional differences among 
democracies are the differences between parliamentary and 
presidential (or, at the state level, gubernatorial) forms of 
government and between plurality elections in single-member 
districts and elections by PR (proportional representation).  I 
have gradually become convinced that, on balance, parliamentary 
government works better than presidential (or gubernatorial) 
government, and that PR works better than plurality.<P>
<B>PR vs. Plurality</B><P>
In this prepared statement, I shall focus on the advantages of 
PR.  Before I do so, however, I should like to state three 
important disclaimers.  First, the advantages and disadvantages 
of PR and plurality should not be exaggerated, as the proponents 
of the two alternatives tend to do.  In my opinion, the relative 
merits are matters of degree, not absolute differences.<P>
Second, although it is possible to make general statements 
about PR, we must keep in mind that there are many different 
forms of PR.  The most important difference here is the 
difference between highly proportional systems, which pose few 
barriers to small parties, and more moderately proportional 
systems.  The latter limit the influence of minor parties by such 
means as applying PR in relatively small districts and/or 
requiring parties to receive a minimum percentage of the vote in 
order to gain representation, such as the 5-percent threshold in 
Germany.<P>
Third, the effects that the different electoral systems have 
depend not only on their own characteristics but also on whether 
they are used in conjunction with presidential or parliamentary 
systems, with or without direct primaries, with a bicameral or 
unicameral legislature, with large or small legislatures, under 
different forms of voter registration and so on.<P>
<B>Democratic Equality and Effective Decision-Making</B><P>
The key arguments about electoral systems revolve around the 
questions of democratic quality and the effectiveness of 
decision-making.  By "quality" I mean the degree to which a 
system meets such democratic norms as representativeness, 
accountability, equality and participation.  There is general 
agreement that PR systems yield greater proportionality and 
minority representation, but that plurality systems promote two-
party politics and one-party executives in which accountability 
can be clearer than in multi-party systems.<P>
As far as government effectiveness is concerned, advocates of 
plurality claim that one-party executives promote firm leadership 
and effective policy-making.  PR supporters, on the other hand, 
argue that effective policy-making requires not so much a strong 
hand as a steady hand, that alternation in office between two 
parties leads to too frequent and abrupt changes and that multi-
party coalitions are better for long-term policy-making and, as a 
result, tend to have greater stability, continuity and moderation 
in policy.<P>
In order to sort out these claims and counterclaims, I did a 
comparative study of 13 democracies with parliamentary systems 
over a roughly 30~year time span, from about 1960 to the late 
1980s: four that used single-member district elections (Britain, 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and nine that used PR 
(Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and 
three Scandinavian countries).<P>
<B>PR Has an Edge in Both Equality and Effectiveness</B><P>
<B>I </B>found a clearly superior performance of the PR systems 
with regard to "quality" factors: generally better minority 
representation, a much higher representation of women in 
legislatures (about four times more women in the PR parliaments), 
a much higher voter turnout (a difference of about 10 percentage 
points) and greater income equality.<P>
In order to measure the effectiveness of policymaking, I 
analyzed the relative success of the different countries with 
regard to maintaining public order and peace and with regard to 
the management of the economy: stimulating economic growth, and 
combating inflation and unemployment.  Contrary to the claims of 
the plurality advocates, I found no significant differences 
except on unemployment: and, in this one respect, it is the PR 
countries that actually have the better records.<P>
The important conclusion that we can draw is that there is no 
trade-off between democratic quality and effectiveness.  We can 
enjoy all of the advantages of PR, such as better minority 
representation -especially important in California as our state 
is becoming more and more diverse -- increased representation of 
women and higher voter turnout.  And we can enjoy these without 
having to pay the price of less effective decisionmaking.  It 
seems to me that this is a very strong argument in favor of 
PR.<P>
<B>Other Advantages for PR</B><P>
PR has several other major advantages.  One is that drawing 
election districts becomes an easy task.  For its districts, PR 
can use natural areas that do not have to be equal in population; 
all districts are multi-member districts, and the number of 
members assigned to each district depends on the district's 
population.  This means that it is no longer necessary to draw 
more or less artificial districts in order to satisfy the equal-
population criterion.<P>
Similarly, under PR, gerrymandering is no longer a problem.  
When districts elect more than about five representatives each 
the minimum number that I believe PR needs partisan 
gerrymandering becomes impractical	and there is no incentive to 
engage in it.  And affirmative gerrymandering -- creating 
districts in which African-American, Latino or other minorities 
are in the majority -- is no longer necessary, because PR takes 
care of the need for minority representation.<P>
Another characteristic of PR is that it stimulates parties to 
conduct active campaigns in all areas of a country or state.  
This is in contrast with plurality systems in which parties tend 
to concentrate on the relatively few districts that are 
competitive and tend to neglect districts in which they are 
either very weak or very strong.<P>
This, incidentally, is one of the explanations for why PR systems 
have higher voter turnouts: parties make more of an effort to 
mobilize the voters regardless of where they live.  And, of 
course, voters have more choice and are also more inclined to 
vote because their votes are less likely to be wasted either on a 
hopeless candidate or on an overwhelmingly strong candidate.  
Because there is more choice under PR, the tendency to engage in 
negative campaigning is also less strong: tearing down one's 
opponent does not necessarily help a candidate.<P>
<B>Advantages for Politicians</B><P>
For the individual voter, PR is clearly the more attractive 
system.  But from what I have said so far, it is also clear that 
PR has great benefits for politicians:	less worry about 
gerrymandering and other districting problems; less need to 
engage in negative campaigning; and better opportunities to focus 
on long-term policy-making.<P>
In addition, successful politicians have the moral satisfaction 
that under PR, the voters that they represent have all voted for 
them -- in contrast with district representatives who have to 
represent usually between one-third and one-half of the 
district's voters who have voted against them.  Another source of 
moral satisfaction is that politicians can spend more of their 
time on matters of broad general interest instead of having to 
pander to the narrow interests of their districts.<P>
In conclusion, let me make the following observation.  I know 
of no democracy that uses PR elections in which there is a strong 
movement to drop PR and to adopt plurality. (The only exception 
appears to be Italy, but the recent change in Italy was not a 
move from PR to plurality but from extreme PR to a mixed system 
that retains an important element of PR.)<P>
In sharp contrast, in all of the major countries that use 
plurality (or similar majoritarian systems) -the United States, 
Canada, Britain, France, India and Australia -- there are active 
and vocal organizations that are campaigning for PR.  Such a 
movement was successful in New Zealand when, in 1993, the New 
Zealanders voted to switch from plurality to PR.  In PR 
countries, voters vote more and complain less, and politicians 
enjoy greater popular respect and more satisfying professional 
lives.  Perhaps this contrast between plurality and PR countries 
is the most convincing evidence in favor of PR!<P align="center">
