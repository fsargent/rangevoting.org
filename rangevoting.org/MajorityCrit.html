<H2> Majority Criterion &ndash; two wordings </H2>

<p>
If worded so a majority winner based on honest voter full-rankings of
all candidates must be elected when one exists and whenever the votes
are consistent with those secret rankings, then <a href="Approval.html">Approval Voting</a>  
fails MC.
</p><p>
If worded so a majority winner based on "the preferences deducible
from the votes themselves" must be elected when one exists,
then Approval
obeys MC.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
At one point the Wikipedia definition of MC was
"if a majority
of voters ranks a given candidate higher than every other candidate,
then that candidate should win."   Note that Approval obeys MC under this wording.
Wikipedia then, in order to prevent Approval Voting from satisfying MC
introduced a special <i>addendum</i> to their wording:
"For non-ranked ballots (e.g.
Approval voting or
Range voting, it can be expressed as follows: 'If more than half of the voters give
candidate X a higher rating than any other candidate, the winner
should be candidate X'."
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Range Voting does satisfy a different, and in our opinion more important,
form of the Majority Criterion:
"If a majority of voters regard X to be the best candidate, then that majority has
a simple and obvious way to force X's election."
