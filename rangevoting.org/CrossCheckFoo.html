Palast's 2016 conspiracy theory re CrossCheck &ndash; his numbers do not work

is about a multiyear pre-election
effort, spearheaded by Republican 
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach,
to "purge" voters from voter registration lists across the USA
using "crosscheck" lists.
These lists supposedly showed voters registered to vote in two different US
states simultaneously.  To stop the horrible threat of
possible double voting, they had to be purged.
(Of course, at least for non-adjacent states, this "threat" 
actually was negligible.) 
But the lists often
intentionally omitted middle names, dates of birth, social
security numbers, etc, making false matches far likelier.
And these "matches" vastly over-represented Blacks 
and Asians, probably because,
for historical reasons dating to the slave era,
Blacks tended to have 
last names selected from a comparatively small set.
(Such as "Jackson.")

Palast had earlier written about this in
</p><blockquote>
<a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/double-voters/">Jim
Crow Returns; millions of voters threatened by electoral purge</a>,
Al Jazeera America, 29 Oct. 2014.
</blockquote>
The Palast / Al Jazeera
2014 analysis of the match-lists found that
an astonishing 1/7 of <i>all</i>
African-Americans living in Crosscheck states were listed
as double-registrants, as compared to
1/8 Hispanics, 1/8 Asian-Americans, and 1/11 whites.
</p><p>
But in the 2016 piece
Palast instead claimed: 1 in 9 blacks, 1 in 6 Hispanics, 
and 1 in 7 Asian-Americans.
</p><p>
All three of these overrepresented groups were more anti-Trump than
the average American, especially
Blacks (who tend
to vote 90% Democratic in the 2016-era USA).
Specifically here are the estimated voting percentages, broken
down by ethnicity,

piece and census data, since he did not actually state these
numbers directly.]
<p>
In the 2016 <a href="USA2016retro.html">election</a>, 
USA-wide Clinton got 48% and Trump 46%
of the votes.  But in the CrossCheck double-registration lists,
we would expect based on the above racial composition that
those listed instead voted 53% Clinton and 41% Trump.
In other words, for each voter prevented from voting due to CrossCheck purging
(if the purged subset were uniform random)
we would expect Trump gained <i>1/10 of a vote extra</i> margin versus Clinton.
And actually Palast 2016 claimed Blacks were more likely than uniform to be purged,
in which case raise that to perhaps 1/6 of a vote.

On his webpage
on 11 November 2016,
Palast upped the ante
by claiming 
<a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/election-stolen-heres/">The Election 
was Stolen &ndash; Here's How</a>.
</p><p>
Palast described Kobach as a "Trump operative" &ndash; I do not know if that is
correct, but it is known that Kobach and Trump met several times and that Kobach's
name was floated as a member of Trump's list of candidates for USA attorney general.
</p><p>
Palast claimed 1.1 million as the total number of crosscheck-listed
people purged from voter registration lists across
the USA in participating states prior to the 2016 election day,
out of 7.2 million listed by
crosscheck lists as potential suspects.
Multiplying 1/6, 1.1/7.2, and assuming 55% turnout,
we find that for each name listed on a CrossCheck list,
we expect 1.4% of a vote advantage accrued to Trump, i.e. 
0.014&times7.2 million = 101K extra vote margin for Trump nationwide.
</p><p>
Was CrossCheck all an above-board, unbiased, and nonpartisan,
honest voter-purging effort?  Bravely stopping vote-fraudsters in their tracks?
I doubt it.  The whole CrossCheck effort with 7.2 million
alleged double-registrants apparently yielded only
<i>four</i>  people actually charged
with deliberate double registration or double voting.
Not exactly a huge threat squelched.
And there seemed to be a remarkable correlation between
participation in CrossCheck, versus Trump winning that state, see picture.
</p>

<p>
But did this all, as Palast claimed shortly after the 2016 election,
constitute "stealing" the election? Well, <b>no.</b>
It looks as though it tried, but if so it didn't succeed.
</p><p>
First of all, 101K extra vote-margin
for Trump (meaning Clinton did not deserve to beat Trump by the
official 2.9 million popular vote margin but <i>really</i> deserved 3.0 million),
spread across the 29 CrossCheck states,
simply was not big enough.
</p><p>
I.e. Palast's very own numbers, plus simple arithmetic I have outlined
but which he never did, actually tells us that
it is <i>impossible</i> that CrossCheck "stole
the election" in any state beside Michigan.
(And even if Michigan was stolen, that was not enough.)
</p><blockquote>
According to Palast there were
499092 Michiganers  on the CrossCheck suspect list.
If &ge;110K of them actually <i>were</i> purged, that would 
have been enough to yield Michigan's official Trump-Clinton
11K vote margin.  But in fact, Palast himself estimated only 55K 
of them were purged.
</blockquote><p>
And I find that even <i>summing</i> the "spoiler"
effects of Johnson &amp; Stein <i>and</i> the CrossCheck effect,
<i>still</i> was not enough to swing the election enough
to stop Trump winning.
</p><p>
So Palast is wrong: the election was <i>not</i> stolen &ndash; or
if it was, it was not via CrossCheck alone; other methods
considerably larger in their
effects than CrossCheck would have been needed.
