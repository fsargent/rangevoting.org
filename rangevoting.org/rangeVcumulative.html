<H2>
"Cumulative Voting"
</H2>

</p>
<p>
is the system where each voter has some fixed number (say five for concreteness)
of "points" which she may divvy out (as her vote) to
the candidates in any fashion she wishes.
For example she could give 2 to Eisenhower and 3 to Lincoln.
</p>

<p>
The trouble with cumulative voting is that,
strategically speaking, 
it is the <i>same thing</i> as <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.
A voter is strategically foolish &ndash; "wastes" part of her vote &ndash; if she 
gives anything less than her full point-count to just one candidate.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a plurality voter reasons: "I really favor Nader,
but if I vote 'Nader,' then, I fear my vote will be stupidly 'wasted' because the real battle is
between Gore and Bush.  Therefore, I will actually vote 'Gore'."
</p>
<p>
If that reasoning was valid (and, in the USA 2000 presidential election, it <i>was</i> valid)
then a cumulative voter can use this same reasoning for <i>each</i> of her 5 votes.
The same reasoning is equally valid all 5 times.
If you, say, vote 4 for Gore and 1 for Nader, then you've stupidly wasted 1 of your 5 votes.
Obviously if all the Gore voters wasted 1 vote out of their 5, but all the Bush voters didn't
waste any votes, then (if these two kinds of voters were approximately equinumerous)
Bush would beat Gore by a 5:4 ratio.  The Gore voters figure (again correctly)
that they can't afford to be that stupid.
</p>
<p>
In view of this, cumulative voting does not fix plurality voting's problems at all.
In contrast, with
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting,.html">Range</a> and 
Approval, you are <i>always</i> completely free to vote max for
your true favorite; there is <i>never</i> a strategic reason not to do so
and this <i>never</i> "wastes" even the tiniest smidgen of your vote.
</p>
<p>
In practice, probably Cumulative Voting would not be quite as bad as Plurality,
because <i>some</i> people would be willing to spread their votes around,
instead of putting <i>all</i> their votes on the lesser evil &ndash; but it is
hardly worth dancing in the streets about.
</p>
<p>
<small>
Cumulative voting  also has been suggested for use in <i>multi</i>winner elections &ndash;
the top W vote-getters win, if we want a W-winner election.
It is not a very good method for that purpose either, 
but that would be a different discussion.
