RangeVoting.org - can't split voting reform forces? Must go with IRV?
</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">

<H2> 
Q. OK, OK, I concede IRV is a worse voting system than Range Voting, 
<i>but</i> it has the Reform-<i>Momentum</i> right now.  So you by promoting range voting are doing us
all a disservice and being tactically unwise by splitting voting-reform forces.
</H2>

<p>(<a href="IRVsplitExec.html">Executive summary</a>)</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Exactly wrong:
we shall demonstrate that
Range Voting is actually <i>unifying</i> reform forces that would <i>otherwise</i>
remain divided.
</p>

It unfortunately is correct there has been division among voting-system reform
advocates, with the "Center for Voting and Democracy" pushing 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>, the "Center for Approval Voting", the "Center for Range Voting" (US) and 
<a href="http://condorcet.org">condorcet.org</a> pushing Condorcet. And you are right that this internal dispute could 
paralyse voting
reform.
</p>

<p>
<i>But</i>
there is one system that is better than all the others, and which the
US third parties (who will have to be the troop-supplier on this one) can
unify behind: range voting.      Once education occurs, there is no split anymore.
Because: 
<ol>
<li>
Range voting <i>experimentally</i> generates <a href="PsEl04.html">much greater support</a>
for third parties
than either approval or plurality voting.
</li>
<li>
Range voting is <a href="VotMach.html">usable on today's voting machines</a>
&ndash; while IRV and Condorcet are not &ndash;
which means it has a lot more chance of getting adopted.
</li>
<li>
IRV <a href="TarrIrv.html">leads</a> to 
self-reinforcing <a href="Duverger.html">2-party domination</a>, just like plurality voting &ndash;
meanwhile range voting (probably) doesn't (and plurality with a genuine separate runoff, definitely
doesn't).
</li>
<li>
The best Condorcet methods are <a href="SchulzeComplic.html">far more complicated</a>
than range voting, quite plausibly also lead to 2-party domination,
and there is no consensus on which of the many of them is the best.
</li>
</ol>
Third parties are not complete idiots.  Given these facts, they are going to unify
behind range, not the others.
That means <i>only</i> range voting can get unified dedicated core support.  So only
it can achieve reform.
</p>

<p>
OK? It is not a matter of Range Voting splitting reform forces and preventing
reform.  It is exactly the opposite: range voting engenders <i>unification</i> of
those forces <i>allowing</i> reform for the first time.
</p>

<p>
So once that is realized, support for Condorcet, IRV, 
and approval is gone.  
We are slowly educating third parties, and as they get educated, they switch to range and do not
come back.   IRV is in fact suicidal for third parties since it 
just <a href="TarrIrv.html">leads to 2-party domination</a>
e.g. in all countries that've tried it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Moral:</b>
The "split" is an illusion.   There is no split, there is only a temporary illusion caused
by a slowdown in education.  If you support IRV then you are merely prolonging
that bad and deluded state of affairs by slowing education and fostering delusions.
<font size="-1">
You may also find it interesting that the (first) inventor  of approval 
voting, <a href="OttewellEndorse.html">Ottewell</a>,
is now endorsing range voting and the CRV as superior.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>Think of</b> IRV as <i>snake oil</i> and range voting as a genuine cure.  
Benefit for society is not got by pushing snake oil, even if the polls say it
is temporarily more popular than the genuine cure by an incredibly tiny margin.
IRV is like a <i>stock bubble</i> &ndash; may look temporarily like a good investment, but it isn't!
</p>

<p>
Now you might object that maybe the above has 
placed too much emphasis on <i>third</i> parties.  We need
support from the <i>top two</i> parties.  Good point.
<b>So consider our main push</b> &ndash; to get Range Voting in the 
<a href="IowaExecSumm.html">Iowa 2008 caucuses</a>.
Suppose we were to instead push IRV in Iowa 2008.  
That would be a tactically worse idea with far less chance than Range of succeeding and
which would yield a less-good result even if it did succeed:
<ol>
<li>
The top Democrats and Republicans who would make this change, see an upside with Range
&ndash; better  presidential choice for them so they can win &ndash; and a downside.  What is the downside?
</li>
<li>
Their downside: risk of major election <b>screwup</b> ala the
<a href="rangeVirv.html#SanF">San Francisco IRV experience in 2004</a>
<!-- (2 week delay for results reported by the <i>SF Chronicle</i> at the other end of that 
<a href="rangeVirv.html#SanF">link</a>) -->
or ala Florida 2000  
(near tie between Gore &amp; Bush &ndash; IRV offers <i>many</i> tie
possibilities, one per round, and hence 
greatly increases the risk of this sort of nightmare, versus plurality voting). 
Also, the Democrats &amp; Republicans risk looking stupid
with IRV if mostly plurality-style
"truncated ballots" are cast (if they allow truncation) or
furious voters (if they instead demand full rank ordering).
Result: ridicule for them and their party.  Ultra-bad news.
</li>
<li>
Unlike range,
IRV <b>cannot be done via just having precincts compute totals</b> and send them in.
That means with IRV, precincts have to compute first round totals.
Then send them in.  Then wait until every precinct has reported.  Then report
the first round results.  Then precincts compute second round totals.
Then send them in.  Then wait until every precinct has reported.  Then report
the second round results.  Then precincts compute third round totals...
Then precincts compute 10<sup>th</sup> round totals.
Then send them in.  Then wait until every precinct has reported.  Then report
the 10<sup>th</sup>  round results. 
If ever an error is found, 
that could force everyone, statewide, to go back to the beginning to the massive
annoyance of all.
This is an election administration nightmare if it is conducted manually
by precinct as currently done in Iowa.  If it were
conducted by computer, then it could be done, but
then you'd have to have <i>every</i> computer connected in a 
statewide <i>network</i> (another nightmare)
<i>or</i> you'd have to ship all the ballots to one Iowa central location, where they
all would be counted centrally (another nightmare and a complete change in procedure from
the current system &ndash; i.e. just asking for trouble).
</li>
<li>
Are the top Ds and Rs idiots?  Why risk ridicule?  With range, they get
the same upside (in fact better upside than IRV &ndash; higher quality election results on
average as proven by extensive <a href="BayRegDum.html">computer simulation studies</a>) 
but no downside (range is in fact superior to plurality
voting in the senses of having <i>less</i> chance of a tie and
is far simpler to total than IRV hence no chance of San Francisco style screwups).
</li>
<li>
The third parties will refuse to help with voting system reform efforts
(except perhaps in a confused and disunified manner and
they'll be angry later when they find out they were scammed) if
those efforts push IRV in Iowa.
But they <i>will</i> help reformers if the push is for Range Voting.  
Because <a href="NurseryEffect.html">range benefits third parties</a>,
but <a href="TarrIrv.html">IRV doesn't</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Another advantage for reformers is that
range leads to less <a href="BackSlide.html">backslide risk</a>.
(Many US cities including NY City adopted IRV voting, especially in the 1930s,
but almost all of them backslid and converted back to plurality voting.  
In contrast I am unaware of any entity that, once it adopted range voting, backslid.
Ever.)
</p>

<p>
One backsliding rationale (used by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>
as justification for their own backslide) 
is that with IRV and Approval Voting, a lot of voters want to vote
plurality style ("truncated ranking").  If you force them to provide full rankings
then the system is unpopular and complicated for the voter, and highly 
<a href="SPRates.html">likely</a> to
lead to invalid ballots, and then
you are exactly wrong in saying that IRV is simpler for the voter.  
Range is simpler:  no permutation constraint &ndash; linear &ndash; additive &ndash;
runs on today's voting machines &ndash; and voters can leave candidate scores 
<a href="Blanks.html">blank</a>
if they feel ignorant about that candidate.  In IRV, blanks are not possible
except via truncated ballots (which oftentimes are disallowed) and this gives
the wrong effect anyhow.  (For example,
even in IRV with truncation, a voter simply <i>cannot express</i> the idea that
Gandhi is best, Hitler is worst, and he feels ignorant about Perot and Anderson.)
A small subset of Australia has allowed
IRV ballot-truncation and the result in Kuring-gai was 63% plurality-style
IRV voting.  That behavior provides good rationale to backsliding
advocates to go back to plurality!  Meanwhile plurality-style range ballots
experimentally are rare &ndash; only 19% even in the extremely highly plurality-genic 2004
US presidential election (<font size="-1">in which the top two candidates got over
99% of the plurality votes &ndash; this is from our 2004 range voting presidential election study
#82 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>
</font>) &ndash; so there will be no such no backsliding
rationale with range voting.
</p>

<p>
OK?  So I hope you can see this pro-IRV anti-range argument &ndash; good as
it might initially sound &ndash; was deluded.
Range is better <i>tactically</i>,
less likely to be a reform that merely <i>backslides</i>, and range is better 
<i>quality-wise</i> and range is <i>less confusing</i> (not more) for 
<i>both</i> the voter <i>and</i> for the 
election officials, and range is much less likely than IRV (and also
less likely than plurality) to lead to <i>nightmares</i> for
election and party officials.
</p>

<p>
And just how much "momentum" has IRV got that we risk sacrificing, anyhow?  Not a whole
heck of a lot.   Most US citizens don't even know what IRV is.
Not a single US state has adopted it.  
A great number of US cities have abandoned STV schemes including New York City
and Cincinnati.  
The "momentum" should be interpreted as "in favor of improving the voting system"
not "about IRV."
That is the <i>real</i> direction of the momentum.
if so, then nothing is lost by advocating a superior 
system &ndash; <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
</p>

<p>A zen anecdote: 
"Global cooling sounds like a great idea, but we need to unify behind global <i>warming</i>,
because it has all the momentum!"</p>
