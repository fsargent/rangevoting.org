<H2> Point by point examination of proposal of IRV for Denver </H2>

<p>(<a href="RangeVoting.html">Return to main range voting page</a>)</p>

<p>
The proposal of <a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a> for Denver
is available (as a CRV local copy) in <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">this pdf file</a>.
We are now going to go through that proposal (and some associated remarks made by
<a href="http://www.fairvote.org">fairvote.org</a>
founder <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/about_us/richie.htm">Rob Richie</a>),  
point by point in detail  correcting erroneous,
false, or misleading points.  
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately IRV advocates, including fairvote.org, have a 
<a href="Irvtalk.html">long history</a>
of making erroneous, false, or misleading statements.

<dt><b>Fairvote.org misrepresents academic experts:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
Fairvote.org listed an 
"advisory board"
containing some well known names, including a couple in academia.
(Here is our
<a href="FairVoteAdvBoard.html">local copy</a> of that fairvote.org web page
giving that list.) 
We were surprised to find, as the top academic expert listed, Professor Steven J. Brams
of the NYU politics department, who (like most academic experts on
voting systems) has often expressed disparaging opinions
about fairvote.org, and indeed Brams once published a paper refuting some false
claims in the <a href="Irvtalk.html#RBMscience">single academic paper</a>
Rob Richie (fairvote.org founder)
ever published.   So we wrote to Brams.  
Brams <a href="BramsNot.html">replied</a> in a letter he 
gave us permission to show to anybody, that he had no idea how fairvote.org had
ever come to list him as a "member" of its "advisory board."

<dt><b>Misleading presentation of one-sided admiring picture of San Francisco:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
Fairvote.org, in its greatest achievement to date, got San Francisco to adopt IRV voting
for its 2004 elections, and it is repeatedly mentioned in the
Denver <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a> as an example of
a "success."  This was misleading because they "forgot" to mention:
</p><p>
1. San Francisco's voting software screwed up and was <a href="SanFranDelay.html">unable</a>
to call the four nontrivial IRV races,
whose result-announcements had to be delayed for weeks.
(Fortunately, SF had mandated a "paper trail" to allow the ballots to
be recounted manually if necessary.)
</p><p>
2. San Francisco's new system not only had trouble
producing <i>winners</i>,  it also confused <i>voters</i>
to a much greater degree than plain plurality voting.
The result was a <a href="SPRates.html">seven times greater</a> rate of
"spoiled" ballots in SF's IRV versus its plurality races.
The <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a> 
described this as "87% of those San Franciscans polled understood 
ranked choice voting."   It may be just us, but we fail to appreciate why
it is a "success" to have a voting system that 13% of the citizens do not understand.
Also do not know how fairvote.org decided the 87% "understood" IRV anyhow.
For example, suppose we had asked these voters:  "In IRV voting, can raising  your ranking of
a candidate from bottom to top, actually cause that candidate to <i>lose</i> instead of win?"
The correct answer, sadly, is "yes" as this
<a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">election example</a> (see fact #5 there)
demonstrates, but we rather doubt that 87% of San Franciscans
would have known that.
</p></dd>

<dt><b>False claim about IRV #1:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
The  <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a> 
on page 6 ("how ranked choice voting works")  says
"it's best to use all three of your rankings."
Unfortunately this statement, while appealing and making IRV look
good and logical, is simply mathematically false.
The same 4-candidate <a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">counterexample IRV election</a>
as before also demonstrates that (see fact #2 there).
Specifically: it can be best to rank only <i>one</i> candidate and 
<i>not</i> the top 3 (which since there are 4 candidates, in this example
is equivalent to ranking all 4).
Specifically: if the "F>N>G>B" voters foolishly rank all the candidates,
then in that example election their most-hated candidate B wins, but if they
rank only one ("F" only) then G would have won (which those voters prefer as
a lesser evil).  We do not see how electing your most-hated candidate is "best" for you.
</p></dd>

<dt><b>False claim about IRV #2 (actually <i>two</i> false claims):</b></dt>
<dd><p>
One page 3 of their <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a> is
<blockquote>
[IRV assures] that a "spoiler effect" will not result in undemocratic outcomes.
IRV allows all
voters to vote for their favorite candidate without fear of helping elect their
least favorite
candidate, and it ensures that the winner enjoys true support from a majority
of the
voters.
</blockquote>
Again, this sounds simple and great for IRV, but again, sadly, it is simply
mathematically false.
In fact,  it took advantage of the fact it had two sentences to use, to make
<i>two</i> false claims:
</p><p>
1. Actually, IRV can and does exhibit "spoiler effect."
To review, in the Bush-Gore-Nader 2000 presidential race, Nader was a "spoiler"
and the act of <a href="Flor2000Res.html">97488 Florida voters</a>
of voting for Nader, caused <i>both</I> their favorite Nader, <i>and</I> their
second-favorite (in most cases) Gore, to lose.   If these voters had (dishonestly)
voted instead for their <i>second</I> choice, then Gore would have won.  
Thus those Nader votes "spoiled" it.
Now consider the following (hypothetical) IRV election:

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their IRV Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
    45
</td>
<td>
Bush>Gore>Nader
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    10 
<td>
Gore>Bush>Nader
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    10 
<td>
Gore>Nader>Bush
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<td align="center">
    <b>35</b>
<td>
Nader>Gore>Bush
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the above election, by the rules of the IRV system, Bush wins.
But if the 35 Nader-voters in the last line were to dishonestly vote
"Gore>Bush>Nader" or "Gore>Nader>Bush", then
Gore would have won.  
So again, these voters' act of honestly voting Nader caused <i>both</i>
Nader and their second-favorite Gore to lose &ndash; again, Nader was a "spoiler"
even though we are now using the IRV system.
The claim that  "IRV allows all
voters to vote for their favorite candidate without fear of helping elect their
least favorite
candidate"
was simply false.
</p><p>
2.   The claim that the IRV winner "enjoys true support from a majority
of the voters" is also simply false:


<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their IRV vote </th>
<th> simplified </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 50 </td>
<td align="center">  A>B>C>D>E </td>
<td align="center"> A>B </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 51 </td>
<td align="center">  B>A>C>D>E </td>
<td align="center"> B </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 100 </td>
<td align="center">  C>D>B>E>A   </td>
<td align="center"> C>D </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 53 </td>
<td align="center">   D>E>C>B>A  </td>
<td align="center"> D </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 49 </td>
<td align="center">      E>D>C>B>A         </td>
<td align="center"> E>D </td>
</tr>
</table>

In the above 303-voter example by Mike Ossipoff,
the centrist candidate C is the favorite of far more voters than anybody else,
and not only would win a head-to-head contest with any single opponent
(based on these votes) but in fact would do so 
by approximately a 2:1 <i>margin</i>.     
(Details: C beats A by 202 to 101; beats B by 202 to 101;
D by 201 to 102; and E by 201 to 102 according to voter preferences.)
So the "right"  winner here clearly seems to be C,
and almost every ranked-ballot voting system would indeed elect C.
But not IRV.  IRV elects D!
(The reason: IRV only examines the preference relations in the "simplified" votes, and
<i>ignores</i> the others.  In contrast, range voting <i>never</i> ignores any part of
your vote.)
</p><p>
We fail to see why it is that the IRV winner D here, as the 
<a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a> 
puts it,
"enjoys true support from a majority
of the voters."   A 2:1 supermajority for C over D
would have been a more massive "landslide" than any US presidential 
election ever, yet IRV in this example tells that supermajority to go jump in a lake!
</p></dd>

<dt><b>False claim about IRV #3:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
On page 2 of the Denver <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a>,
it says
<blockquote>
Voters can vote for the candidates they really like, which eliminates spoiler candidates
and "lesser of two evils" dilemmas.
</blockquote>
But this is simply false, as we just demonstrated (countererexample election 1 to
false claim #2):  the voters favoring Nader could <i>not</i> vote for the candidate
(Nader) they "really liked" because that would lead to the (in their view)
<i>greater</i> evil (Bush) being elected; they instead were forced to
dishonestly vote for the "lesser of two evils" (Gore, in their view) to prevent that.
The lesser of two evils dilemma is <i>still</i> there for Nader voters with IRV,
exactly the way it was there with plurality voting.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, with <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, voting Nader top 
can <i>never</i> hurt a voter
who favors Nader.  
Range voting <i>genuinely</i> cures the spoiler problem, and <i>genuinely</i>
permits voters to vote for their favorite without fear, IRV doesn't.
</p></dd>


<dt><b>False claim about IRV #4:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
On page 2 of the <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a>, they note that
IRV is used in "London," and on page 3:
"Instant runoff voting (IRV) is a well-tested voting method for single-seat offices, 
such as Mayor or  Governor."
Well, London does not have a Governor, but it does have a Mayor, who is
the most prominent "single seat office" there.  We have no idea what the proposer
had in mind about London, but we can tell you that London's Mayor definitely is <i>not</i>
elected using the IRV method, although London's system is related.
For example, under IRV, if you vote A top but B second-choice, then under the IRV
system, A could be eliminated and
then your vote would <i>entirely transfer</i> to B.   Then if B in turn were eliminated,
your vote would entirely transfer to your third choice, and so on.
But under London's system, 
if there was not anybody who got over 50% of the first-choice
votes, then your second choice votes are then counted instead of being ignored,
<i>except</i> if your first-choice had been for one of the top-two, <i>or</i> if
your second choice had <i>not</i> been for one of the top-two, in which case
your second choice still is ignored.
Then, whoever has the most (non-ignored) votes wins.
(If you had any third, fourth, etc, choices, those are always ignored, and there
are no further rounds byond the second, unlike IRV.)
Thus in the (most recent) 2004
London Mayor election, the first choice vote totals were

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<tr> 
<th> candidate </th>
<th> vote % </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Livingston
</td>
<td>
36%
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Norris
</td>
<td>
28%
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Hughes
</td>
<td>
15%
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Maloney
</td>
<td>
6%
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> (others)
</td>
<td>
12%
</td>
</tr>
</table>

so that nobody got over 50%.  The second-choice votes <i>if</i> they
were for Livingston &amp; Norris <i>and</i> if they
were cast by voters who did not vote for Livingston &amp; Norris originally,
were then added on  
at which point
Livingston (who originally had 685541 votes) now had 828380 votes
and won.  This is not the same system as IRV.

<dt><b>IRV "promotes cost-saving elections"?</b></dt>
<dd><p>
That is what it says on page 3 of the fairvote.org <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a>.
But we repeat, IRV voting does not work with simple non-computerized
voting machines (or many computerized
kinds either).  Meanwhile, plurality and range voting both <a href="VotMach.html">do</a>.
So we fail to understand how that "saves costs."  
We agree IRV perhaps could save money versus a <i>two</i>-election runoff system
(but perhaps not, if the two elections both could be run with today's voting machines but
the IRV election could not, and if the second election often was not held) &ndash;
but  <i>any</i> single round system such as range voting would accomplish <i>that</i>.
</p><p>
Another thing: since IRV elections can lead to a tie (or near-tie) in <i>every single round</i>
and each such can affect the final election result and hence is very serious, 
the <a href="TieRisk.html">tie-risk</a> with IRV is
far greater than with plain plurality voting.  (Meanwhile, switching to range voting
would vastly <i>decrease</i> the risk of ties.)    As you may recall, every near-tie
election leads to a nightmare for election administrators
with an expensive and heavily scrutinized recount
&ndash; and often a legal battle ala Bush-Gore Florida 2000.
We fail to see how having vastly more such battles will "save costs."
</p>
<p>
It should be illuminating to check this press report about the 
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">Univ. or Vermont IRV cost study</a>.

<dt><b>Fairvote.org's North Carolina "success" and the "movement" of the USA "toward" IRV:</b></dt>
<dd><p>
Rob Richie, commenting on and replying to our preference 
for <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> on the 
<a href="http://lists.newworldcultures.com/mailman/listinfo/irv-l">bulletin board</a> set up for
public comments about the Denver voting-reform <a href="DenverIRVProp.pdf">proposal</a>, said:
"Jan may like range voting, but the rest of the nation continues to
move toward instant runoff voting.
The North Carolina state
legislature just passed a bill to use IRV for judicial vacancies
(elected with public financing) and test it out in up to 20 cities
and counties..."
</p><p>
This was misleading for three reasons.
</p><p>
<i>First</i>, range voting, since it is used for academic 
"election" of valedictorians (the "candidates" are the students,
and the "votes" are their grades in each class, each grader in each class gets one vote,
and the student with the highest average range vote, i.e. highest GPA, is elected)
has been used for far more "elections" in the USA over the last 200 years, than IRV.
The academic world  reached a worldwide consensus that range voting
was the best voting method to use for this purpose, long before Rob Richie was born.
We find it exceedingly dubious 
that the academic community now, were Rob Richie to present them with the "superior"
IRV voting method, would be interested in switching to a technique in which each
professor would, as his vote for valedictorian, present a rank-ordering of every student in the
school, from best to worst.   In fact, we very much doubt that Rob Richie would be able to
obtain even one such vote from even one professor at any sizable college or
university anywhere in the entire country.  And even if each professor were required merely
in his vote to select the <i>top three</i> students in the school (in best-to-worst order;
this is a simplified degenerate form of IRV which would be illegal in Australia),
we think that would still be rejected by every school in the country as clearly unacceptable
in comparison to their current range voting system.
</p><p>
<i>Second</i>, the USA has <i>not</i> "continued to move toward instant runoff voting."
In fact, more US cities have decided to <i>abandon</i> single-transferable vote 
(after they tried it for many years) 
and go back to the plain plurality system, than fairvote.org has managed to
get to <i>adopt</i> IRV.  The most famous abandonment examples
were New York City and Cincinnati.
Based on that, it might appear that it would have been more accurate for Richie to say
that the nation has "continued to abandon the IRV system as a failure"!
What about range voting?  Well, no city has ever adopted range voting,
to our knowledge, so we unfortunately cannot claim any great national movement as yet.
(We would like Denver to begin such a movement.)
But we will say this.
Among the numerous US <a href="ConsensusSumm.html">organizations</a> 
that do employ range voting, as far as we know
<i>zero</i> have ever abandoned it in favor of any other voting system,
and as we mentioned above (the academia/valedictorians example) such abandonment
would probably be considered so ludicrous it would not even <i>be</i> considered.
That is not the case with IRV; for example the 
<a href="http://www.ams.org">American Mathematical Society</a> abandoned IRV for its
internal elections and now employs <a href="AppExec.html">approval voting</a>
(a simplified form of range voting which we "approve" of less).  Range and approval
voting both also have the advantage of
being substantially simpler since they both run on 
<a href="VotMach.html">every voting machine in the USA, right now</a>, no
modification required.  (Try <a href="quickdemo/PresBallot.html">demo</a>.)
</p><p>
<i>Third</i>, 
the North Carolina bill that Richie is referring to, did <i>not</i> implement IRV, but 
rather a bastardized version of it which seems far worse than genuine IRV (which in
turn is worse than range voting).   The North Carolina measure, as
described in fairvote.org's
<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/irv/?page=21&articlemode=showspecific&showarticle=2229">own
description</a> (local <a href="FVNCdesc.html">copy</a>),
says
"In an instant runoff, voters would be allowed to rank their order of
preference among the candidates. The first choices of voters initially
would be tallied. If the leading candidate failed to win more than 40
percent of the first-choice votes, the top two candidates would
advance to the runoff."
</p><p>
The use of "40%" is very peculiar and undesirable.
If a candidate gets a 41% plurality, there is no runoff;
that candidate wins immediately. 
(Even if another candidate was close, say 40%.)
Now wait a minute. I thought voting reformers agreed pretty much
unanimously that Plurality voting is bad.  But the North Carolina
system acts exactly like Plurality when <i>any</i> candidate has more than
40% of the first-choice votes.
</p><p>
For a real-life example, consider Florida 2000. Under IRV, the
preferences were roughly:

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> Candidate </th>
<th> vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bush </td>
<td> 49% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Gore </td>
<td> 49% </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Nader </td>
<td> 2% </td>
</tr>
</table>

where the Nader voters preferred Gore over Bush.
</p><p>
So it's pretty clear that Gore would have won under regular IRV and
almost every other voting system ever proposed (other than the one
actually used).  <i>Regular</i> IRV does fine in that kind of scenario.
</p><p>
<i>But</i>, with the North Carolina mutant so-called-IRV, the Plurality
winner (Bush) had more than 40% of the votes, so Bush would have been
chosen as the winner without any sort of runoff.  Don't you think this
sort of situation is exactly the sort in which a runoff is maximally desirable?
</p><p>
Examining our <a href="FunnyElections.html">table</a>
of historical national presidential elections, we observe that in
Romania 2004, Senegal 2000, Cyprus(Greek) 1998, Estonia 1992, Cyprus(Greek) 1993, and
Portugal 1986, the North Carolina system would in all cases have
elected the same winner as plain plurality system; 
but in all of these cases
a top-two runoff was then held (those countries employed the
same rules as Denver now uses) and elected somebody else that the voters wanted more.
Thus, in our seven historical examples, fairvote.org's
North Carolinian pseudo-IRV system would have elected a winner
the voters wanted less than the winner that Denver's present system
would have given them!   We consider, therefore, this example of
a fairvote.org "success" to be, compared to the system Denver has now,
a "large step backwards."
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Fairvote.org's North Carolina "success" (Richie reply):</b></dt>
<dd><p>
<p>
Rob Richie replied as follows:
<blockquote>
The North Carolina bill was a remarkable success story, where
advocates in the legislature did a tremendous job getting it through.
Your attack shows the kind of political naivete that I can find so
irritating. There isn't a prayer in the world that they could have
won with range voting or your other objects of enthusiasm, and they
should be applauded for doing something really hard and really important...
You should understand that traditional runoffs are already used for
state and congressional primaries in the North Carolina. The state
already has a 40% threshold that triggers these primary runoffs, set
in part due to concerns relating to voting rights and opportunities
for African American candidates to win in white-majority primary
electorates. The North Carolina bill accepts that threshold for some
offices, but does allow a 50% threshold for localities that want to
try out IRV.
I know you enjoy the math of all this, but there's a political
world we live in.
</blockquote>
To that we reply: we agree progress was made in those instances (if any &ndash; we
are not aware of any actual instance) where the 40%
has been replaced by 50%.  However, in the cases (which were the only ones
mentioned in the 
<a href="FVNCdesc.html">Associated Press article</a> about it)
where 40% has stayed 40%, the only "progress" that has been made has been to replace
a possibly-2-round system by a single-round system, thus hopefully saving some time and money
&ndash; 
but at the same time unfortunately requiring in some cases new voting machines
and allowing new dishonest and damaging
voter strategies, which may be enough to cancel out the cost savings and/or decrease
the winner-quality.  (Note: every IRV country 
is <a href="TarrIrv.html#facts">2-party dominated</a>, just
like the USA, because the IRV voting system discriminates against "third parties" just like
plurality.  However, in contrast, plurality+top-2-runoff countries
such as France, Romania, Chile, etc have <i>more</i> than 2 parties &ndash;
as was recognized by <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger</a>.  This illustrates
the fact that the "instant" and "genuine separate" runoff systems are <i>not</i>
equivalent, even though they naively sound similar.)
So in those 40&rarr;40 cases we do not consider this to be a "remarkable success story,"
but rather "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
</p>
<p>
To be a little less dramatic (?) about it: the reason we are in the voting reform business
is to improve fundamental flaws in our voting system, which cause
undemocratic phenomena like "voting for your favorite <i>hurts</i> your cause" and
"more candidates on the side of Good actually makes it <i>more</i> likely that Bad
will win" and "a candidate preferred over everybody else by the voters, still loses."
Range voting fixes all three of these flaws; IRV fixes only the middle one.
We are <i>not</i> in the voting reform business because we want to re-issue essentially
the same voting system as before, but done in a way which hopefully will save a little money.
That could be nice, but there are far more impactful ways to save taxpayer money than that,
so if that were your goal it would hardly be worth bothering.
</p>
<p>
We invite Rob Richie to apply his formidable political skills to pushing a
voting system which is simpler, cheaper, more reliable, and less likely to lead to a tie,
than IRV, and produces <a href="BayRegDum.html">better winners on average</a>
with fewer undemocratic
pathologies &ndash; <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
We believe Denver could be an excellent opportunity for that, and the result 
would be something that <i>everybody</i> would agree was an improvement,
even the <a href="ApisMellifera.html">bees</a>.
