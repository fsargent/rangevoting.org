Approval and Condorcet winners conflict?  Amazing "no-conflict" theorem!
</h2>

<p>(<a href="#Summary">skip to end</a>)</p>

Steven Brams
once contended it was very rare in practice for Approval and Condorcet winners to differ
(when the latter existed).  I disputed that, noting that
<a href="RandElect.html">computer simulations of random normal elections</a> said different.   
Also Blake Cretney at
<a href="http://condorcet.org">condorcet.org</a> had the idea
they'd often differ and usually Approval in such cases was "wrong" and Condorcet "right."
I now do some interesting analysis that tends to support Brams' view.
Also, we note that D.Roderick Kiewiet in <i>Polity</i> 12,1 (1979) 170-181,
on p180 claimed that Approval Voting was "far more likely to elect Condorcet Winners"
(than plurality), a claim we and our computers fully agree with.
For definitions of terminology, it may help to consult the 
<a href="Glossary.html">glossary</a>.

</p>

<p>
The simplest possible election example in which Condorcet and Approval
disagree on the winner is:
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
2
</td>
<td align="center">
C > A > <font color="purple">|</font> > B
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
1
</td>
<td align="center">
A > <font color="purple">|</font> > C > B
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Here 
<b>A is the approval winner</b> (unanimously approved by all 3) beating C (2 approvals) and B (0);
<b>C is the Condorcet winner</b> (C>A by 2:1 ratio, C>B unanimously);
C also is the plurality, Borda, and IRV winner;
and we denote the approval threshold with "<font color="purple">|</font>".
</p>
<p>
However, <i>knowing</i> it was down to C versus A, the C>A>B approval-voters would strategically
(and I wouldn't even call this "dishonest";  I'd call it "semi-honest" because it
only shifts the "<font color="purple">|</font>" without altering any ">") 
disapprove A, in which case this election really would be
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
2
</td>
<td align="center">
C > <font color="purple">|</font> > A > B
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
1
</td>
<td align="center">
A > <font color="purple">|</font> > C > B
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
and C would win with every method, so actually
this was <i>not</i> a realistic example of an Approval versus Condorcet "conflict."
</p>
<p>
So: what if we instead ask for an example of Condorcet versus Approval 
disagreement
where all the approval votes are <i>strategic</i>
about A versus C  (i.e, always approve
of exactly <i>one</i> of them).
</p>
<p><b>
AMAZING "NO-CONFLICT" THEOREM: 
</b>
There <i>does not exist</i> a 3-candidate tie-free election in which the approval voters
are both honest about their candidate orderings and strategic about their threshold-placement, 
in which the Approval and Condorcet winners differ!
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
Maximize  s  subject to these inequalities  (note I use 4-letter-long variable names):
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">
CBTA+CTBA+ACTB+ATCB+CATB+CTAB &ge; s + BCTA+BTCA+ABTC+ATBC+BATC+BTAC, 
<br>
CATB+CTAB+BCTA+BTCA+CBTA+CTBA &ge; s + ACTB+ATCB+BATC+BTAC+ABTC+ATBC, 
</font>
<br>
<font color="blue">
ABTC+ACTB+BATC+CATB+ATBC+ATCB &ge; s + BCTA+BATC+CBTA+BTCA+BTAC+ABTC,
<br>
ABTC+ACTB+BATC+CATB+ATBC+ATCB &ge; s + CBTA+CATB+BCTA+CTBA+CTAB+ACTB,
</font>
<br>
ABTC &ge; 0,
ACTB = 0,
BCTA &ge; 0,
BATC &ge; 0,
CBTA &ge; 0,
CATB = 0,
ATBC &ge; 0,
ATCB &ge; 0,
BTCA = 0,
BTAC = 0,
CTBA &ge; 0,
CTAB &ge; 0,
<br>
<font color="green">
ABTC+ACTB+BCTA+BATC+CBTA+CATB+ATBC+ATCB+BTCA+BTAC+CTBA+CTAB = 1000
</font>.
</p>
The
<font color="red">
first two</font> inequalities state C is the Condorcet winner, and if s>0 without a tie;
the 
<font color="blue">next two</font>
state A is the Approval winner, and if s>0 without a tie;
the next 12 make the number of voters of each type be non-negative (and zero in
the case of vote-types with non-strategic threshold placements), and the 
<font color="green">final</font> equality says the total
number of voters is 1000 &ndash;  or any other positive number could be substituted for 1000,
that will not matter.
The maximization can be done with the "simplex algorithm 
for linear programming" since these inequalities constitute a "linear program in standard form."
The result is that s=0.  I.e, it is not possible to make s>0.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Remarks:</b>
For information about linear programs, standard form, and simplex method, see 
George B. Dantzig: <i>Linear progamming and Extensions</i>,
Princeton University Press 1963.
We can, by examining the optimum of the linear program, strengthen the theorem to
state that the only possible way for Condorcet and Approval to disagree is if
there is an exact tie for the approval winner <i>and</i> an exact 
tie for the Condorcet winner (which still isn't much of a "disagreement").

<p>
Actually, the above proof, while valid, is overkill.
We can prove a better theorem with a simpler proof:
</p>
<p><b>
EVEN BETTER "NO-CONFLICT" THEOREM: 
</b>
Let N&ge;2.
There <i>does not exist</i> an N-candidate tie-free election 
in which the Approval (A) and Condorcet (C) winners differ, <i>provided</i>
that, if they were going to differ (A&ne;C) that all the approval voters would
place their threshold strategically under the assumption the winner was going
to be either A or C, i.e. would place it somewhere between them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
Assume for a contradiction that A&ne;C.  Then the approval voters
will strategically place their thresholds
<font color="purple">|</font> between C and A.
But that will cause C to be approved more times than A is approved (since C, being
the Condorcet winner, is preferred over A by a majority).  Hence the claim A
was the Approval winner and A&ne;C, leads to a contradiction.  Hence either A=C
or there is no Condorcet winner C.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>
<H2> Conclusions (some counterintuitive)  </H2>
<p>
In view of this fact, it seems that much of the so-called "conflict"
between the Approval and Condorcet "philosophies," is illusory.
</p>
<p>
We now see that approval voting <i>always will</i> elect the
Condorcet Winner C (if C exists) provided merely that the voters
consider it <i>likely</i> that both C and whoever (A) the putative non-C approval winner
might be, might be elected &ndash; and hence vote strategically
about C versus A.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a highly realistic assumption in practice.
</p>
<p>
So we see that in practice, the supposed "difference" between Approval and
Condorcet
actually will rarely exist &ndash; so for practical purposes, Approval <i>is</i> a Condorcet
method!
</p>
<p>
Indeed &ndash; counterintuitively &ndash; it might actually be that
Approval Voting is <i>more</i> likely to elect the Condorcet Winner in practice,
than Condorcet Methods!
</p>
<p>
Why? Because in approval voting it is quite rare that strategically voting 
dishonestly,
is wise. (And when it is wise, it is even rarer that people will actually realize it and do it.)
In other words, with AV, people will tend to honestly order the candidates, and
the only strategic decision they'll make is where to locate their approval
<font color="purple">|</font> "threshold."
</p>
<p>
In contrast, with Condorcet methods with rank-order ballots, it seems a lot more
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">common</a>
to see a way to be usefully strategic-dishonest in your vote. In other words, I
suspect
it will be comparatively common that voters will dishonestly misorder their preferences.
</p>
<p>
In that case, it might well be that Condorcet rank-order ballot systems will do
something
silly (like <a href="DH3Summ.html">not electing</a>
whoever should have been the Condorcet Winner with
honest votes)
more commonly than AV will in practice fail to elect the Condorcet Winner.
</p>
<p>
In that case, for practical purposes AV will be a better Condorcet method than
actual "official" Condorcet methods!
</p>
<p>
I really think this is actually quite likely, it is not just some unlikely theoretical
speculation. 
And if so, it is quite a remarkable counterintuitive conclusion.
