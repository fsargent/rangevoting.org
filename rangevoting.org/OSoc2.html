Why Socialists Should Support Range Voting

Presidential Candidate Walter Brown.

<p>
The lesser-of-two-evils problem
makes most progressives vote for some 
sleazy corrupt "lesser-evil," 
abandoning the honest candidates for whom they wish they could 
vote.
And you know that is why Socialists, Greens, Ralph Nader, and 
other progressive candidates receive vote-totals 
only representing a fraction of 
their true support.
</p>

<p>
But what isn't generally appreciated is the <i>size</i>
of this problem and the <i>degree</i> to which the 
lesser-of-two-evils problem is 
nothing but an artifact of a bad voting 
system -- the vote-for-one Plurality system
now in use.
</p>

<p>
That's good news, because it means 
that this is a huge problem that could be eliminated just by 
changing to a better voting system: Range Voting.
</p>

<p>
We're not just blowing smoke here.
The table shows both the official  2004
popular vote results (USA-wide)
for the Republican, Democrat, 
Nader, Green, and Socialist Workers presidential candidates,
and what their range-vote average scores would have been
(NY state suburbs, from
our RV exit poll study using scores on an 0-100 scale).

</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">

<p>
<i>All</i> of 
the minor party candidates did <i>over 50 times</i>
better (relative to Bush) 
in the Range Voting poll than in the actual 
Plurality voting election.

<p>
Range Voting is <i>not</i> Instant Runoff, which has been heavily 
promoted around the 
country. Instant Runoff, <i>contrary</i> to its promoters' 
claims, and <i>unlike</i> Range Voting,
<i>won't</i> get rid of 
the incentive to betray one's favorite by 
voting him below top to help some lesser-evil.
<font size="-1">
(We know that both because of several counterexample elections
on our web site,
and also
because all the world's IRV countries are 2-party dominated.)
</font>
</p>

<p>
Range Voting is already familiar to you
since we've all 
been asked to rate things from 1 to 10. 
Some Olympic events are scored by 
Range Voting. The definition:
<br>
Each voter may give points to any 
number of candidates, giving to each any 
number of points that the voter wants to, 
within some range pre-specified by 
the election rules.
The candidate with the  highest average rating wins.
</p>

<p>
E.g. in one popular version, you could give 
any rating from 0 to 10
to any candidate.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of Range Voting is that 
you never have any reason to vote anyone 
over your favorite. 
Even if you want to fully help the 
Democrat (by giving him/her 10 points), 
that doesn't prevent your vote
from also giving 10 points to the Socialist, Green,
or Nader.
</p>

<p>
For the first time, everyone would 
be able to fully vote for their favorite, 
<i>even</i> if they feel a need to 
help the corrupt sleazy Democrat. For the 
first time, vote totals would finally reflect true support.
</p>

<p>
Another thing: No more rivalry. 
Socialist parties and candidates are not 
each other's enemies, though vote-for-one 
Plurality pits them against each other. 
With 0 to 10 Range Voting, Socialists could give 10 
points to <i>all</i> the 
Socialist parties' candidates. Why not?
<br>
So here's how two ballots could look.
</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<p>
I (voted by a Socialist, Naderite or Green)
</p>
<hr>
<pre>Socialist A: 10 points
Socialist B: 10 points
Socialist C: 10 points
Ralph Nader: 10 points
Green:       10 points
Democrat:     0 points
Republican:   0 points
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<p>
II (compromise progressive)
</p>
<hr>
<pre>Socialist A: 10 points
Socialist B: 10 points
Socialist C: 10 points
Ralph Nader: 10 points
Green:       10 points
Democrat:    10 points
Republican:   0 points
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table> 

<p>
Note that these ballots only vote 
the extreme ratings, 10 points and 0 
points. That's good strategy:
maximum points to the acceptable 
and minimum points to the unacceptable candidates. 
But anyone can vote 
intermediate ratings if they choose.
</p>

<!--
<p>
With Range Voting the 
cautious compromise progressive could help genuinely 
progressive candidates, while also fully helping the 
Democrat that he thinks 
he needs to vote for.
And Socialists and all progressives could be 
united by Range Voting into a powerful 
progressive force, whose members 
would receive much better vote results (relative to
the major party candidates) than they get now with the 
current voting
method.
</p>

WHAT IS SOCIALISM all about?
We think it is about the people getting power and using it
to make  good decisions.
Well range voting is a superior collective decision-making
tool.  We've done computer simulation studies of different
voting systems and found range voting to deliver 
robustly the best quality decisions (on average) among
about 30 systems compared.  In contrast, plurality voting is
an excellent tool for rich fat cats to use to control
everything via locked-in 2-party dominance and 
98%-predictable US elections, while making
the people <i>think</i> something
"democratic" has happened.
</p>

<p>
DO YOU WANT Socialist Party supporters to feel free to vote for the
SP candidate, without fear of "wasting their votes" 
or "spoiling" the
election (electing the Republican)?
</p>

<p>
DO YOU WANT the different Socialist Parties to be allies rather than rivals in
the election?
</p>

<p>
DO YOU WANT the Socialist Party to get much better vote results that
it has been so far?
</p>

<p>
DO YOU WANT the media to pay much more attention to Socialist Party
campaigns, and to the issues promoted by the Socialist Party and its
candidates?  (We can assume that the media will pay more attention to
the minor parties if they get much better vote results.)
</p>

<p>
IF SO: urge the SP Platform Committee to make promotion of Range
Voting for public elections a part of the SP Platform, and a high
priority action item in the SP's strategic plan.
