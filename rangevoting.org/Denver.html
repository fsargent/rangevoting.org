<H2> Welcome, Denverites! </H2>

<p>
This is essentially the same article that was posted at <a href="http://denver.yourhub.com/Story.aspx?contentid=107610">http://denver.yourhub.com/Story.aspx?contentid=107610</a>

<H3> MacKenzie's election reform proposal should use Range Voting </H3>

<p>
Denver Councilwoman Kathleen MacKenzie proposed replacing
Denver's election procedures with Instant Runoff Voting (IRV).
The intent is mainly to eliminate the expensive and troublesome runoff
elections that are sometimes used to choose the mayor, auditor, and
most city council members.  We agree it's a good idea to eliminate the
runoffs but recommend <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>
as a better replacement.
</p>

<p>
According to current election rules, if no candidate gets 50% of
the votes in the May election, a runoff is held about a month
later to choose between the top two.  Runoff elections
are cruel and unusual punishment for everyone.  The candidates have
probably spent their last dimes campaigning for the first round
election; suddenly, they have to raise more money
and campaign for another month. The candidates are exhausted.  The
<i>voters</i> are exhausted!  The election department has to scramble to
determine which races need runoffs, print new ballots, and prepare 
and conduct the runoff election.  And after all that, voter turnout
for the runoffs is generally poor.
</p>

<p>
MacKenzie's proposal eliminates the need for runoffs by asking voters
to <i>rank</i> the candidates (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd...).  The
ballots are then counted by the IRV method to choose the winner. 
No separate runoff election is needed.
</p>

<p>
We recommend Range Voting instead:  Voters are asked to give
each candidate a score in a range of, say, 0 to 10; the one with 
the highest average score wins.  (Again, no runoff needed.)
</p>

<p>
We do <i>not</i> recommend simply eliminating the runoff and reverting to the
"vote for one" method (called Plurality Voting).  That can
yield "vote splitting" election fiascos like Florida 2000.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious
advantage of Range Voting over IRV is
that it gives voters more freedom of expression.  
With IRV you might rank three candidates 
<br>
<center>
Favorite: 1st choice  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Middling: 2nd  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worst: 3rd.
</center>
<br>
But, do you like Middling a lot or a little?  
With IRV ballots, you can't say, and no one can tell by looking at your ballot.
With Range Voting, you can give scores (ratings) to the candidates, e.g.
<br>
<center>
Favorite: 10  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Middling: 5  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worst: 0.
</center>
<br>
would indicate that Middling was indeed somewhere in the middle.  But,
if you like Middling almost as much as Favorite, you can score
Middling 9.  You can even give a score of 10 to both Middling
and Favorite, if you want to help Middling win as much as possible.
With IRV, if you marked Favorite and Middling as tied for 1st place,
your ballot would be discarded.  
That's one reason San Francisco, when it adopted IRV in November 2004,
experienced <i>seven times</i> more "spoiled ballots."
</p>

<p>
With IRV, suppose you fear Worst is most likely to win &ndash; <i>but</i> 
Middling might win
if some of those preferring Favorite would vote Middling 1st.
Many people would thus vote for the "lesser of two evils"
Middling,<sup id="r-weevils"><a href="#f-weevils">1</a></sup>
who might indeed win as a result.
Unfortunately, such "strategic" voting causes the election results to
under-represent the actual support for Favorite.  Favorite could get
discouraged and not run again.  With Range Voting, there's <i>never</i> any
strategic reason <i>not</i> to score Favorite maximum.
</p>

<p>
Range Voting is fully compatible with all existing voting machines,
so Denver could use it in the May 2007 municipal elections with
the existing equipment.  But most voting machines and software don't
properly check and count IRV ballots.  In the San Francisco
election, vote counting software glitches delayed reporting
preliminary results.<sup id="r-delays"><a href="#f-delayss">2</a></sup>
Denver's voting machines are not expected to handle IRV by May 2007.
</p>

<p>
We urge the Denver City Council to create a ballot measure to be voted
on in November 2006, to change the City Charter to mandate
Range Voting in Denver municipal elections, beginning
with the May 2007 election.
<sup id="r-timeline"><a href="#f-timeline">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
By adopting Range Voting, Denver can eliminate its expensive runoff
elections, make excellent choices of winning candidates, and perhaps
most important of all, serve as an example for others
to follow, leading to better elections throughout the USA.

<p>According to MacKenzie:
"It has to pass on final consideration by August 28.  Counting backward,
that means that it has to be on first reading (published) by August 21.
Consequently, the actual bill has to be filed in final form by noon on
August 17.  Because it will be controversial, we shouldn't eliminate any
steps, so it must be considered in committee no later than August 8.
And even that will seem rushed to people -- and you don't want to give
Councilmembers the "out" of rejecting the idea because there hasn't been
time to appropriately consider it. Ideally we would have the whole month
of July to consider it in committee and lobby Council members once
specific language is determined. Kathleen MacKenzie"
