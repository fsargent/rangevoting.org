<H2> Why we have not provided a computerized election administrator </H2>

<p>
The only way to provide a tool which not only <i>prints out</i> ballots, but
also in fact <i>runs &amp; counts</i> elections, is if voters pre-register,
then we put all the voters in a database,
then we make an election, then each voter when voting types in his
secret pre-registered password (preventing vote-abuse),
then it checks the votes versus the database  (preventing vote-abuse),
and totals the legitimate ones.
</p>

<p>
It is a royal pain to do all that...  and even if we did then the pre-registration process 
could also be subject to abuse by the creation of, e.g, fake voters.
