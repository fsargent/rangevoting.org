RangeVoting.org - Gerrymandering by "independent commissions"
</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">

<H2> Do "independent" or "bi-partisan" district-drawing commissions work
to "solve the gerrymandering problem"? </H2>

<p>
<a href="RosenbEd.html">Eli Rosenbaum at the <i>Washington Post</i> says no</a>:
&quot;In practice, such commissions have not been nonpartisan, apolitical or
effective.&quot;
</p>

<p>
We do not entirely agree with that -- they <i>have</i> been highly effective
in <i>Canada</i>. But in the USA, it looks like Rosenbaum is correct: he
cites 
<a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd108_gen/ind_pdf/Arizona/AZ_CDloc.pdf">
Arizona</a>,
<a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd108_gen/ind_pdf/New_Jersey/NJ_CDloc.pdf">
New Jersey</a>,
and
<a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd108_gen/ind_pdf/Washington/WA_CDloc.pdf">
Washington</a>
as the 3 states
with
such commissions already with more than two House districts.
And as you can see by clicking the links to their district maps,
all three look pretty darn gerrymandered, with Arizona being especially blatant,
but the  other
two still seem fairly clearly
gerrymandered.  (Do you like the two "go out to sea and come back to land"
districts in Washington?)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&quot;in the past two House election cycles, every incumbent in New Jersey,
Washington and
Arizona won. &quot;
<br><br>
&quot;as the current commissions demonstrate, equal representation on the panel for
both
parties tends to favor the status quo. The commission is indeed <i>bi</i>partisan, not
nonpartisan, and each party's delegates on the panel are closely connected to
their state
parties and politicians. To avoid gridlock and approve a plan, commissioners
must draw a
map that is pleasing to both sides, and of course nobody on either side really
wants a
competitive district. Political scientists even have a name for this type of
redistricting
scheme: bipartisan gerrymandering.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;In New Jersey, the commission worked closely with the state's congressional
delegation,
even scrapping one proposed map because it failed to win the support of key
Democrats.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even worse, Rosenbaum argues, should such a commission produce unfair or unsatisfactory results, 
voters have <i>no recourse</I>.
</p>

<p>
In view of this, it seems to us that the non- or bi-partisan commission "solution"
is not as good as our own <a href="GerryExamples.html">algorithmic solution</a>.
