<H2>  IRV versus Top-2-Runoff &ndash; T2R "flips" more winners </h2>
<H3> (perhaps explaining why IRV yields 2-party domination while T2R doesn't) </H3>
<p><small>
By Jim Riley &amp; Warren D. Smith, Sept. 2009.  (Skip to <a href="#conclu">conclusion</a>.)
</small></p>  

<p>
We examine the hypothesis that <b>IRV</B> (<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff</a>) 
and <b>T2R</b> (ordinary top-2-runoff voting;
2-round elections, 2nd round undertaken if no candidate gets over 50% of the votes in
the first round)
<b>behave rather differently</b> in practice, despite the fact that naively speaking,
they might seem similar.
We and <a href="DuvTrans.html">others</a> 
(e.g. <a href="Duverger.html#furtherread">Taagapera &amp; Shugart</a>)
had previously 
noted
(see also
<a href="HonestRunoff.html">comparison</a> and 
<a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">evidence</a> and 
<a href="TTRvIRVreasons.html">possible reasons</a>)
that IRV apparently always causes a country to devolve into 
<i>(&le;2)-party dominated</i> ("duopoly") status (at least, in IRV seats), while top-2-runoff
usually <a href="DuvTrans.html">doesn't</a>.
</p><p>
The question is why.  One possible <b>hypothesis</b> is that with IRV, the <i>same winner</i>
nearly always
wins (in practice in the real world) as the one who would have won with plain 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting.  And it is well known
(<a href="Duverger.html">"Duverger's law"</a>) that the latter causes duopoly, with the 
top reason being that
voters fear "spoilers" and strategically alter votes in effort to avoid them; this causes 
"third parties" to weaken and die.
Meanwhile (the hypothesis continues) it is significantly less 
frequent that T2R and Plurality elect the same winner.
</p><blockquote><small>
Suppose IRV voters tend to vote one major-party-candidate top (and the other bottom or nearly)
in a naive effort to "increase the impact" of their vote. THEOREM: If over 1/3 of IRV voters
rank each major-party candidate top (and there are two major parties) then a third-party candidate 
can never win.  ANOTHER THEOREM: If over 75% of the voters vote in one of the two forms
"A&gt;almost all others&gt;B" or
"B&gt;almost all others&gt;A" then either A or B will always win.
It <A href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">appears</a>
these 66.67% and 75% threshholds are comfortably exceeded in Australia
&ndash; 
exactly why in its three House election cycles 2001-2007 (comprising 450 individual IRV elections)
there were a grand total of zero third-party winners.  This also presumably explains the
heavy agreement between IRV and plain plurality voting's winners.  
(<a href="NESD.html">NESD property</a>.)
</small></blockquote>
<p>
If so, it would be logical that IRV would behave highly similarly to plurality and, over time,
fatally weaken third-parties and thus force duopoly.   But T2R would behave differently-enough from
plurality that third parties could stay strong enough usually to prevent duopoly.  
(Both empirically happen.)
</p><blockquote><small>
And there may be a nonlinear "tipping point" positive-feedback effect
such that if third parties are too weak, they get weaker (leading to death), while if strong 
enough, they can stay that way.  (This is the same principle that makes nonlinear bistable
"flip-flop" electric circuits work.)
</small></blockquote>
<p>
Our purpose here is to examine the veracity of that hypothesis. We shall
<a href="#conclu">end up</a> confirming it.

<p>
Similarly some of the IRV-table's "same-winner" numbers
has been split into races "decided on first preferences"
and those "where a distribution of preferences was necessary to determine the elected candidate"
(according to the <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au">AEC</a>).  Evidently the latter happens
about 45% of the time.
</p>

<blockquote><small>
<b>Later note:</b>
Antony Green provided a <a href="AustralianElectionsTable.html">table</a>
of many more years of Australian House-IRV elections, which we have not verified.
Green's table finds an average (over the 24 election cycles 1949-2007)
plurality&rarr;IRV winner "flip rate" of 5.4% and the percentage of races where a pseudo-runoff 
was required was, on average, 35.5%.  
</small></blockquote>

<p><b>IRV Notes:</b>
Voting (and full rank-ordering) is theoretically 
compulsory in (most of) Australia, although 
about 6% break the law and
<!-- 94.32% turnout in 2004 house els says AEC; 94.85 in 2001 -->
do not vote and of the ones that do vote,
about <a href="SPRates.html#aust">5%</a> fail to cast a valid ballot.
I think in 100% of the Australian IRV races tabulated, there were at least 3 candidates.  
However, of the 10 Irish presidential races, there were only 3 cases with &ge;3 candidates
(1945:3, 1990:3, and 1997:5) &ndash; i.e. in the other 7 cases (five with 1 candidate, two with 2)
the use of "instant runoff" voting was illusory.
Irish turnout was 48% for the 1997 election.  In <a href="Ireland1990.html">1990</a>, 
over 99% of the ballots were valid but about 10% of them
failed to give a full rank-ordering of the three candidates.
</p>

<p><b>T2R Notes:</b>
Factors leading us to use Texas include: large number of
elections (150 districts contested every two years) with relatively large
electorates (around 140,000 persons per district in 2000; note Texas has about 15%
greater population than Australia).  
In addition, there
is a quasi-non-partisan nature to the primaries. Texas does not have party
registration; you simply choose your party on election day.  (Texas used to have
one-party domination by the Democrats &ndash; so the primary effectively was the real election
&ndash; which is the historical reason there is a runoff.)
In many areas, if you want to vote for your
local county officials, you have to vote in the Democratic or Republican
primary. 
<!-- And on the primary ballot there is nothing equivalent to party
affiliation. Well duh. (unless you include ethnicity ??!!) -->
Voter turnout (as a fraction of adult population; these numbers would be higher
as a fraction of registered voters)
in competed TX house primaries appears to range from about 4% to 50%,
averaging about 14%.  The reason we restricted attention to the Texas races with &ge;3
candidates is those were the only ones where a runoff was even a possibility.  
Most Texas House primaries have 0 or 1 candidates &ndash; i.e. are not elections at all! &ndash;
and the majority of the genuine elections involve fewer than 3 candidates making
a runoff impossible.  E.g. in the 1992
Democratic Primary (150 districts), only 28 had &ge;2 candidates, only 13 had &ge;3,
of which there were 9 runoffs:
</p>
<pre>
   35  No Candidate (causing Republican to be unopposed in general election)
   84  1 Candidate (i.e. primary was not necessary)
   15  2 Candidates
   11  3 Candidates (7 with runoff, 4 without).
    3  4 Candidates (3 with runoff).
    1  5 Candidate race (led to runoff).
    1  7 Candidate race (led to runoff).
</pre>
<blockquote><small>
Incidentally, the fact that only 3.5% of the 2700 primaries over the
18-year span needed a runoff suggests that arguments against runoffs based on cost savings 
may be largely irrelevant.

<h2> Criticisms </h2>

<p>
This data has been criticized as not a truly-fair comparison of T2R versus IRV, because, e.g.
<ol><li>
Low-turnout-Texans psychologically differ from high-turnout Australians &ndash; so ours
is an "apples to oranges" not "apples to apples" comparison.  (One could also attack Ghana,
Ireland, etc as not
being "apples," but since the data is dominated by 
Australia and Texas, that matters little.)
</li><li>
Usually candidates only run if they think they have a chance to win.  Therefore
by employing <i>only</i> the Texas races with &ge;3 candidates, we created a "selection bias"
towards "less clear" races.   
</li><li>
Apple: Australia in IRV seats (house)
has 2-party domination (although not in its non-IRV senate seats).
Oranges:
Texas also has 2-party "duopoly," but in <i>primary</i> elections this is not terribly relevant
because every candidate is from one party, which has no particularly-organized subparties.
And most of the T2R countries are not duopolies.
</li><li>
When computing the statistical error bars (see <a href="#conclu">conclusion</a>)
we assumed all the IRV elections were independent of each other.  (Ditto for the T2R
elections.)  In fact, there are dependencies, since, e.g, a similar race might occur
next election in the same district.  Therefore, the error bars
ought to be greater than we said.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Our responses:</b></p>
<ol><li>
No matter what we had done, we could be attacked for this reason.  The fact is, there are not 
very many large IRV and T2R elections in the world, and one has to use the limited data that is 
available.  We did.  If you want to study an unreal artificial world in which the T2R and IRV 
elections <i>are</i> conducted in exactly-alike settings, then use a computer simulation study.
(We've done those too.  What generally happens is, critics complain about computer studies 
since they are "not the real world" and complain about real-world studies since they are 
"not in a perfect jewel-like setting like a computer-simulation study would have been." Sorry.)
So far, our critics on this score have not suggested better data sources.
Further, a factor&gt;3 alteration in flip rate, is so large it is difficult to credibly
ascribe to such psychological differences.
</li><li>
One could counter-argue that every Australian race
had &ge;3 candidates, and Australian races usually have more candidates than in Texas &ndash;
so that, if anything, the bias operated in the other direction!   Indeed, this would seem
to mean that Australia should, a priori, expect <i>more</i> chance of "flips"
than Texas, but in fact they get a factor of 3.3 <i>fewer</i>, which <i>strengthens</I>
our main conclusion that T2R flips more races (not weakens it).
[But it could be counter-counter-argued that in Australia, many of the contenders were running 
merely to "carry the flag" for various Australian third-parties, 
not because they had a reasonable expectation of winning; while in Texas most thought they
had a chance to win &ndash; different candidate psychologies,
therefore more selection bias in Texas.  One then could counter<sup>3</sup> that
in Texas, unanointed candidates could select a race to try to win, but in Australia third parties
won zero out of 450 seats and hence they could not even <i>try</I> to be selective since no matter
what they tried, they always lost &ndash; thus proving Australia's comparative lack of democracy 
versus Texas, due to IRV versus T2R.]
</li><li>
True.  But that <i>reinforces</i> our point: IRV leads to duopoly, T2R mainly 
does not.
You can criticize 
our study for such differences, but one of the points of making a 
real-world study is to <i>detect</i> and <i>observe</i> such differences!
They really exist.  Duopoly is a self-strengthening feedback loop; it is not just
that (a) IRV's election results yield duopoly; duopoly also (b) creates a setting in which IRV's
election results are affected, yielding... duopoly.
In the real world (a) and (b) both happen and cannot be disentangled.
(One could <i>try</i>
to disentangle them by using recently-created countries like <a href="FijiPol.html#2pd">Fiji</a>
which have not yet had
time to develop full duopoly.  However, there is less data of that sort, and if we 
had done this we would have been &ndash; justly &ndash;
criticized for using "atypical" and "irrelevant" election
data from dubious infant/proto-democracies!)
</li><li>
These dependencies don't amount to much.   E.g. in Australia, the 9 flipping districts in 2007,
were entirely different from the 8 in 2004, which in turn were entirely different from
the 5 in 2001.   In Texas, the 148 runoff-possible races
were scattered
so rarely among the 2700 total primaries that again, little dependency could happen; 
even the top three most-competitive districts (#28, #47 and #75) 
each only had 4 races during the 18-year
(10-primary) span with &ge;3 candidates each, and of the 
11 runoffs that resulted, none repeated both contenders and only two
repeated one contender.  
</li></ol>

<p>
To sum up:
I think we've done this study nearly as well as could have been reasonably expected given the
limitations forced upon us by operating in the real world.  The conclusions are pretty clear.
Which are:

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p><small>[Warning: ???NEEDS SLIGHT REVISIONS IN NUMBERS SINCE ADDED NEW 
<A href="assets/documents/SFelhistory.txt">SF</a> DATA.]</small></p>

<p>
Based on the data here, real-world IRV elections yield a (4.86&plusmn;0.99)% "flipping" rate 
(i.e. rate of changing the winner away from the plain-plurality winner).
But T2R elections lead to (16.36&plusmn;2.49)% flip rate. 
[We have provided "mean&plusmn;1&sigma;"
error bars viewing all exemplars of each election-type as 
i.i.d. Bernoullis.]
We therefore have over 4.29&sigma; worth of confidence, <a href="NormTble.html">i.e.</a>
over 99.999% confidence, that T2R elections really do yield a greater flip rate than IRV elections.
(In fact, the <a href="PuzzNormalArith.html">ratio</a> is 3.37&plusmn;0.93.)
Hypothesis confirmed!
</p>
<blockquote><small>
Of course, the underlying reason <i>why</i> TTR has over 3&times;
greater flip rate, is a separate
question which this data does not directly address.  See the
<a href="TTRvIRVreasons.html">reasons</a>
page for our guesses.  But just the fact that it does, regardless of why, is probably a big 
reason for further effects like IRV 2-party-domination dysfunction.
<br><br>
One also could argue, based on this, that by campaigning to change true-runoff elections
to instant in the USA, that the voting-"reform" group "FairVote" has actually been 
<i>reducing</i> democracy.
