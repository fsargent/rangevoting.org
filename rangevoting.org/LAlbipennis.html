<H1> Voting: The wisdom of ants </H1>

<p>
If the nest of the tiny (about 3mm long) eusocial ant 
<a href="assets/images/LAlbip.gif"><i>Leptothorax Albipennis</i></a>
is damaged, then the inhabitants will collectively locate new
nest site candidates and choose among them before moving the colony there
and building a new nest.
Their decision-making process is described and modeled in

<p>
The ants' process is very similar to the (more heavily studied and
better understood) ingenious range-voting process
employed by <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a>,
but with the following differences:
<ol>
<li>
 The ants walk at millimeters per second while the bees fly at 3 meters/second.
 That allows the bees to explore an area of about 150 sq km seeking the best nest site.
 Meanwhile the ants only explore an area of a few square <i>meters</i>.
 The ants make their decision in 2-5 hours, while the bees take 5-350 hours.
</li><li>
Most scout ants 
inspect more than one 
candidate site, enabling a direct comparison.
But most scout bees only inspect <i>one</i>.
</li><li>
Bees have a "dance" sign language that allows them to inform other bees of both  the location
and the numerical desirability of a possible nest site.
However, ants do not have sign language and can only inform other ants about locations by
requesting that they follow (or physically carrying them) there, and apparently
cannot directly indicate a numerical desirability level at all, only a "yes" or "no"
ala <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In view of the last fact, it might at first seem impossible for ants to do 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voting at all.
However, ants <i>can</i> recruit other ants to inspect a site with different
<i>probabilities</i> and with different <i>delays</i> between recruitments.
(And they do.)
That <i>still</i> enables the ants, in a <i>statistical</i> sense averaged over many recruitment
acts, to convey 
continuum "site quality" information as a continuously variable "exponential growth rate."
Eventually, the faction representing
the site with the greatest average "perceived quality" value, will dominate.
</p>
<p>
The idea (same as the <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a>
use) is for each "faction" supporting some site-candidate
to recruit new members, where each faction grows exponentially at different growth rates
proportional to the <i>average</i> (up to statistical noise)
of some measure of its site's quality.
