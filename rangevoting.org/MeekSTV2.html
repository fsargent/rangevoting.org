<h3>Abstract</h3>
The feedback counting method used for Single Transferable Vote elections,
developed in an earlier paper, is extended to cover situations in which
there are non-transferable votes. It is shown that present counting methods,
on the other hand, may not satisfy the condition that the number of wasted
votes be kept to a minimum in such situations. The extension of the method
to permit voters to give equal preferences to candidates is also described.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
In an earlier paper<a href="#r1">[1]</a> (hereafter referred to as Paper
I) the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system of voting was considered from
the point of view of certain conditions, the main one being that as far as
possible the opinions of all voters are taken equally into account; it was
shown that present STV counting methods do not satisfy this condition. A
'feedback' counting mechanism was suggested which would overcome this
problem. In Paper I, however, we confined ourselves only to the cases where,
whenever a vote is rescrutinised for transfer, a next preference is always
given. In this paper we shall show how the feedback method can be extended
to cope with situations where no such preference is available. We shall here
adopt the reverse procedure to Paper I; we shall consider the application of
the feedback mechanism to these cases first, and only then discuss present
counting methods in the light of the conditions.

<h3>2. Rules for vote-casting</h3>
Even within the same voting system major differences can be made simply by
changing the rules governing what constitutes a valid ballot. For example,
in a multiple-vacancy election by simple majority where each voter has one
independent vote for each vacancy, the result can be totally different if
the voter is forced to use all of his votes (in effect to vote against his
favourite candidates) instead of using only some.<a href="#r2">[2]</a>  In
STV the equivalent requirement would be that all candidates should be listed
in preference order. However, in the simple-majority case distortions can
arise in that some votes may not be genuine, having only been added in order
to make up the correct number; in STV a voter may only wish to express his
preferences for a few candidates, being indifferent to the remainder. Normal
STV practice is in fact to accept as valid any ballot showing a unique first
preference; thereafter the voter may, optionally, give further preferences
for as many or as few of the remaining candidates as he wishes. In STV the
feedback mechanism could be applied as it stands simply by declaring as
invalid any votes which do not give preferences for all candidates or
(relaxing this somewhat) declaring invalid during the progress of the count
any vote encountered for which a next preference is required but not
available, and then restarting the count. However, it would clearly be more
satisfactory not to impose additional restrictions on the voter if this can
be avoided.

<h3>3. Extension of the feedback method</h3>
We recall here the two principles of the feedback mechanism stated in Paper
I:
<ul>

<li><b>Principle 1.</b> If a candidate is eliminated, all ballots are
treated <i>as if that candidate had never stood</i>.
 
<li><b>Principle 2.</b> If a candidate has achieved the quota, he retains a
fixed proportion of every vote received, and transfers the remainder to the
next <i>non-eliminated</i> candidate, the retained total equalling the
quota.

</ul>

Since transfers are only made from eliminated or elected candidates,
non-transferability only arises when all the marked candidates are
eliminated or elected. The simplest case to consider is that when all the
marked candidates are eliminated. By Principle 1, such a ballot has to be
treated as if those candidates had never stood; and hence as if the ballot
is invalid. This implies that the total <i>T</i> of valid ballots is
reduced; this in turn implies that, on the elimination of any candidate, if
non-transferable ballots occur the feedback should include the recalculation
of the quota, using the reduced value of <i>T</i>.

<p>
The case of a ballot with marked candidates who are elected is less
straightforward. Suppose an elected candidate C receives a total <i>x</i> of
votes with no further preferences marked on them (any marked eliminated
candidates can, by Principle 1, be ignored). By Principle 2, C must pass on
a fixed proportion <i>p</i> of these, as all other, votes and retain the
rest as part of his quota. The difficulty arises because it is not clear to
whom these votes should be transferred.

<p>
If the difficulty were to be avoided by increasing the proportion
transferred of votes for which a next preference is marked, to enable all
<i>x</i> votes to be retained by C, this would clearly reintroduce
inequities of the kind Principle 2 was designed to eliminate. Not to
transfer the proportion at all would mean leaving C with more than the quota
(see also section 4). The two possible ways of strictly obeying Principle 2
are

<ul>
<li>(a) to divide the otherwise non-transferable proportion equally between
the remaining (i.e. unmarked and uneliminated) candidates; or

<li>(b) to subtract this quantity from the total <i>T</i> of votes cast, and
recalculate the quota with the new value.
</ul>

Method (a) is based on the view that the voter regards the unmarked
candidates as of equal merit, which is why he has not given preferences. The
second method is based on the view that the voter's action is a partial
abstention; he has not sufficient knowledge of these candidates to judge
between them, and prefers to leave the choice to the other voters. It should
be noted that the two methods are not equivalent; in the first the totals of
the unmarked candidates, in particular the non-eliminated ones, are raised
equally, whereas in the second the quota increases the proportions
transferred from the elected candidates, and the increase in the votes of
non-elected candidates will vary according to these values.

For the moment we shall resolve the (apparent) dilemma by making the
(apparently) arbitrary decision to adopt the second method. The <i>prima
facie</i> case for this is that in general some unmarked candidates will be
elected candidates, and hence the adoption of the first method will in any
case involve the recalculation of the quota. However, the real justification
will appear in section 6, when it will be shown that the dilemma need not,
in fact, exist at all.

<h3>4. Current STV practice</h3>
Current STV procedure in dealing with non-transferable votes involves
different rules in different circumstances. The main rules are

<ol>
<li> If a vote is not transferable from an eliminated candidate, it is set
aside; such votes play no further part in the count.

<li> If the number of votes non-transferable from an elected candidate is
not greater than the quota, those votes are included in the quota and only
the transferable votes determine the distribution of the surplus. If the
number is greater than the quota, then the transferable votes are
transferred (at unreduced value), the difference between the
non-transferable votes and the quota increasing the non-transferable total.

</ol>

In Paper I we considered STV from the point of view of three conditions.
Condition (C) we shall discuss later; the others were

<ul>
<li>(A) The number of wasted votes in an election (i.e. which do not
contribute to the election of any candidate) is kept to a minimum.

<li>(B) As far as possible the opinions of each voter are taken equally into
account.

</ul>

It is clear at once that, when there are non-transferable votes, condition
(B) cannot be satisfied even by the feedback counting method unless
recalculation of the quota is included, for otherwise candidates at a later
stage of the count, when a number of non-transferable votes have
accumulated, need less that the original quota to be elected. Indeed, if as
many as <i>q</i> votes become non-transferable, it is impossible for the
last elected candidate to achieve a full quota.

We saw in Paper I that condition (A) is satisfied when there are no
non-transferable votes. When votes do become non-transferable these have to
be added to the 'wasted' total <i>W</i>, and the formula in Paper I becomes

<p>
<i>W</i> &lt;= <i>T</i>/(<i>S</i> + 1) + <i>T</i>0

<p>
where <i>T</i>0 is the non-transferable total. However, this is derived from
a quota calculated on the total <i>T</i> and not on the total available vote
<i>T</i> ' = <i>T</i> - <i>T</i>0. Thus with recalculation of the quota we
have

<p>
<i>W</i> ' &lt; <i>T</i> '/(<i>S</i> + 1) + <i>T</i>0 = <i>W</i> - <i>T</i>0
/(<i>S</i> + 1) &lt; <i>W</i>

<p>
i.e. condition (A) is violated unless the quota is recalculated<a href="#r3">[3]</a>.

<p>
It is clear that rule (ii) above is an attempt to satisfy condition (A), but
it only does so at the cost of violating condition (B);  for example,  if  a 
candidate E is elected with <i>q</i> + <i>x</i> votes, <i>q</i> of which are
non-transferable, the <i>x</i> remaining votes will be transferred at
unreduced value to the next preference even though their earlier preference
for E has been satisfied. Further, the present rule that votes cannot be
transferred to an elected candidate (see Paper I) means that both by rule
(i) and by rule (ii) many whole votes may be declared completely
non-transferable, thus swelling <i>T</i>0 and <i>W</i> above, whereas the
feedback method allows each vote to count partly for the elected candidates
marked and only a fraction becomes non-transferable.

<p>
Thus, on two grounds, current STV counting methods violate condition (A). It
could perhaps be argued that the feedback method cannot satisfy condition
(A) unless method (a) rather than method (b) of section 3 is used when
dealing with unmarked candidates. We shall discuss this point in section 6.

<h3>5. Recalculating the quota</h3>

It can be seen that in recalculating the quota and having to apply it in
retrospect to candidates already elected, the same difficulties occur as in
the simple feedback situation, without non-transferable votes, described in
Paper I. We consider first the case of an elected candidate. If some of his
votes are non-transferable, the appropriate proportion is subtracted from
the total vote, and the quota recalculated. the reduction in the quota makes
more of the elected candidate's votes surplus, which increases the
proportion for transfer; this increases the non-transferable proportion to
be subtracted from the total, which further reduces the quota, and so on.
The equations to be solved are

<p>
<i>q</i> = [(<i>T</i> - <i>p</i>1<i>&times;t</i>10)/(<i>S</i> + 1) + 1]  .....(Equation:1)

<p>
<i>t</i>1(1 - <i>p</i>1) = <i>q</i>  ............(Equation:2)

<p>
where, as in Paper I, <i>S</i> is the number of vacancies, <i>T</i> is the
total votes (now ignoring any which mark only eliminated candidates),
<i>t</i>1 the total for the elected candidate, <i>p</i>1 the proportion he
transfers, <i>t</i>10 the total vote for the candidate not transferable to
others, and <i>q</i> is the quota.

<p> 
These two equations can be solved easily for <i>p</i>1 and <i>q</i> by
equating the expressions for <i>q</i>; however, if there is more than one
elected candidate the iterative method of finding the <i>p</i>i, described
in Paper I, will be needed, and it is convenient to discuss the extension of
the iterative process to include the recalculation of the quota in terms of
the simplest case, above. Equation (1) with <i>p</i>1 = 0 gives the original
value of <i>q</i>. Equation (2) then gives a first value of <i>p</i>1 &gt;
0. Substitution of this value in (1) gives a new value of <i>q</i> smaller
than before; use of the new <i>q</i> in (2) gives a larger <i>p</i>1, and so
on. Thus we have a monotone increasing sequence of values for <i>p</i>1,
bounded above by 1, and a monotone decreasing sequence of values of <i>q</i>
bounded below by 0; these sequences must therefore tend to limits which are
the solutions to the equations. The convergence rate is satisfactory; simple
analysis shows that the errors are multiplied in each cycle by a factor
which is at most 1/(<i>S</i> + 1).

<p>
The process is extended to the case of <i>n</i> elected candidates by adding to the equations in Paper I the equation

<p>
<i>q</i> = [<i>T</i>n/(<i>S</i> + 1) + 1]

<p>
which must be evaluated for <i>q</i> first in each iterative cycle.   
<i>T</i>n = <i>T</i>n(<i>p</i>1,<i>p</i>2,....,<i>p</i>n) is the total
available for transfer in each case; for <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 3 it is given by

<p>
<i>T</i>1 = <i>T</i> - <i>p</i>1<i>&times;t</i>10

<p>
<i>T</i>2 = <i>T</i> - {<i>p</i>1<i>&times;t</i>10 + <i>p</i>2<i>&times;t</i>20 + <i>p</i>1<i>&times;p</i>2(<i>t</i>120 + <i>t</i>210)}

<p>
<i>T</i>3 = <i>T</i> - {S1 <i>pi&times;ti</i>0 + S2 <i>pi&times;pj&times;tij</i>0 +
S3 <i>p</i>1&times;<i>p</i>2<i>&times;p</i>3&times;<i>t</i>(123)0}

<p>
In these formulae <i>tij</i>...<i>k</i>0 is the total transferable from
candidate <i>i</i> to candidate <i>j,</i> to ..., to candidate <i>k</i> but
not further; S1 denotes summing over <i>i</i>;  S2  denotes summing over all
<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>i</i> /= <i>j</i>;  S3 denotes summing over all
permutations of (123).

<p>
The reader will easily derive equivalent formulae for higher values of
<i>n</i>; putting <i>pn</i> = 0 in the expression for <i>T</i><i>n</i> gives
the expression for <i>T</i><i>n</i>-1.

<h3>6. Equal preferences</h3>

In section 2 we discussed briefly the effect of different validity rules on
otherwise identical voting systems. The usual STV counting procedures depend
on the existence at each stage of a unique next preference, the only
deviation allowed being, as we have seen, that the absence of further
preferences does not make the vote as a whole invalid. It is standard
practice to accept as valid a vote with a unique first preference, and to
accept further preferences provided one and only one is marked at each
stage; if no, or more than one, next preference is given at any point, all
markings at and past this point are ignored.

<p>
For the simplest form of STV counting, involving the physical transfer of
ballot papers from pile to pile, the need for a unique next preference is
obvious. However, with the feedback method such a restriction is no longer
necessary, and indeed it is not necessary even with Senate Rules counting. A
vote can be marked A1, B1, C2, ... with A and B as equal first preferences
and credited at 0.5 each to A and B. If A is elected or eliminated the 0.5
is transferred at reduced or full value to the next preference &mdash; which
of course is B and not C. In effect, such a vote is equivalent to two normal
STV votes, of value 0.5 each, marked A,B,C... and B,A,C... respectively.
Similarly, if A, B, C are all marked equal first, this is equivalent to 6 (=
3!) votes of value 1/6 each, marked A,B,C...; A,C,B...; B,A,C...; B,C,A...;
C,A,B...; and C,B,A... . It is easy to see that this can be extended to
equal preferences at any stage, and that <i>K</i> equal preferences
correspond to <i>K</i>! possible orderings of the candidates concerned, each
sharing 1/<i>K</i>! of the value at that stage.

<p>
Such an extension of the validity rules enables us to resolve the dilemma
between the methods (a) and (b) in section 3 of dealing with
non-transferable votes. A voter who, at a certain stage, wishes his vote, if
transferred, to be shared equally between the remaining candidates, can
simply mark those candidates as equal (i.e. last) preferences. Thus the
dilemma does not after all exist; both of the methods can be used, and the
voter himself can determine which is to be used for his own ballot by the
way that he marks it; failure to rank a candidate indicates a genuine
(partial) abstention.

<p>
This extension of the validity rules also enables condition (C) of Paper I
to be satisfied more closely. The condition was:

<ul>
<li>(C) There is no incentive for a voter to vote in any way other than
according to his actual preference.
</ul>

Here we are interpreting this condition in a particular way not discussed in
Paper I: the STV voting rules not merely encourage but force a voter to vote
other than according to his preference in the restricted sense that, e.g. if
he rates two candidates as equal first he is not allowed to vote
accordingly, but must assign a preference order between them which may well
be arbitrary. In view of the importance of first preferences in STV, this is
undesirable. A voter is similarly forced to make an unreal ordering of
candidates to which he is indifferent if, for example, he has listed his
real preferences but wishes to give the lowest ranking to a candidate he
particularly dislikes. This kind of voting is very common.

<p>
Permitting equal preferences thus gives much greater flexibility to the
voter to express his ordering of the candidates, and is thus a desirable
reform whether the feedback method is used for counting or the Senate Rules
retained.<a href="#r4">[4]</a>

<h3>7. Concluding remarks</h3>

Two distinct problems arise in the development of a voting system; the
information with regard to the choices which is required from each voter,
and the way in which this information is to be processed to arrive at "the
social choice".

<p>
The first problem is mainly outside the scope of these papers, but has been
touched on in the last section. It is a basic assumption of STV that the
individual preference orderings of each voter is sufficient information<a
href="#r5">[5]</a> to obtain the social ordering, and the voting rule
extensions described above follow naturally from this principle, and indeed
bring STV more closely into line, in a certain sense, with the work of
Arrow.<a href="#r6">[6]</a>

<p>
The possible development of (preferential, transferable) voting systems
which use further relevant information is the subject of continuing
work.<a href="#r8">[8]</a>

<p>
The second problem is the classical problem of decision theory. Assuming the
basic STV structure, these papers have shown that the feedback method of
counting is needed to satisfy the declared aims of STV as a decision-making
procedure more consistently.

<p>
This improvement can be made without causing any more difficulty to the
voter, and allows the counting procedure to be described by two simple
principles instead of by a collection of rules, some of which are rules of
thumb.

<p>
The disadvantage of the method is the need for many repetitive calculations,
which for reasons of sheer practicality rules it out for manual counting
except when the numbers of vacancies, candidates and votes are small.
However, as pointed out in Paper I, an STV count is already a sufficiently
tedious process for it to be worthwhile to use a computer, and the additions
to the feedback method described in this paper would be simple to add to the
computer program.

<p>
As E G Cluff has pointed out,<a href="#r7">[7]</a> one advantage of
election automation is that one is not restricted in the choice of voting
system to what is practically feasible in a manual count. The feedback
method can lead to different results from the Senate Rules in non-trivial
cases, and is therefore a choice to be considered when the automation of STV
elections is being implemented.
