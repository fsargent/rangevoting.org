<h2> American National Election Study "Feeling thermometer" 1968-2008 </h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://electionstudies.org">American National Election Study</a>
has interviewed
a large number (over 1000)
of random Americans each presidential election year pre- and post-election &ndash;
including a range-voting pseudo-election using an 0-to-100 score-range.
They published the following ridiculously abbreviated
<b>"summary table"</b> giving the results of those pseudo-elections.
Note: this table <i>omits</i> data (which they also collected) about
all the non-Democrat non-Republican candidates, and also totally discards all sorts
of other interesting conclusions which could also have been drawn from their data
had they not been incredibly lazy about it.  It would be good if somebody were
to re-examine their data.  For example based on the thermometer data
P.R.Abramson et al:
<i>Third-Party and Independent Candidates in American Politics: Wallace, Anderson, and Perot,</i>
Political Science Quarterly 110 (1995) 349-367
found that in the years 1968, 1980, and 1992 (and this also is true in 1996) where
there were significant third-party candidacies,
the official election winner always 
also was the "Condorcet winner," i.e. was preferred versus each rival
pairwise by a voter majority.   However, that arguably was not true in 2000:
Barry <a href="Burden.pdf">Burden</a> showed that the ANES thermometer data indicated
that Ralph <a href="#GoreBushNader">Nader</a>
was the Condorcet winner i.e. was preferred versus every rival X by
a majority of the voters who scored both Nader and X.  (Although a substantial number
of voters did not provide a score for Nader, and so this conclusion depends how the
Nader non-scores are treated.)
</p><p>
Anyway, for what little the ANES
summary table is worth, note that it finds that in <i>every</i> case
1968-2008 the <i>same</i> president would have been elected with highest-average-score
range voting as with
ordinary plurality voting (<i>popular</i> vote), namely
1968=Nixon,
1972=Nixon,
1976=Carter,
1980=Reagan*,
1984=Reagan,
1988=Bush I,
1992=Clinton,
1996=Clinton,
2000=Gore (popular vote winner; Bush II only won thanks to Electoral College &amp; Florida),
2004=Bush II,
2008=Obama...
</p><p>
*<i>except</i> that in 1980, the range voting data actually 
gave a <i>tie</i> between Reagan and Carter, at least after rounding their average scores
to whole numbers.   
The range voting assessment also found that Reagan's VP George H.W.Bush was slightly preferred by
the electorate using range voting versus Carter's running mate Walter Mondale.

<h2> 1980 US Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
<b>Official plurality results:</b>
Ronald Reagan won with 50.7% of the popular vote, beating Jimmy Carter (41.0%),
John Anderson (6.6%), Ed Clark (1.1%), and Barry Commoner (0.27%).
</p><p>
<b>Approval &amp; Condorcet voting:</b>
Brams &amp; Fishburn devote chapter 9 of their <a href="RVPapers.html">book</a> 
to an analysis of the top three finishers in this election.  An ABC News exit poll 
(unpublished data given to B&amp;F) found these results in hypothetical 2-candidate contests:
RvA 53:41 (6 abstain),
AvC: 49:46 (5 abstain),
RvC: 54:43 (3 abstain),
so Reagan was the clear Condorcet winner with <i>Anderson second</i>!
(Polls also showed Anderson was preferred pairwise over Carter everywhere but the South.)
Brams &amp; Fishburn after a long analysis concluded Anderson probably also would have beat
Carter also under <a href="AppExec.html">approval voting</a> despite the fact a 
<i>Time Magazine</i> poll 2 weeks before the election found the percentages
of voters rating each candidate "acceptable" were R=61, C=57, and A=49.
In any event, it is clear that Anderson got <i>enormously</i> less support in the official
results, due to
plurality-system distortions, than he deserved.
</p><p>
<b>Range voting:</b>
ANES therometer data indicates Reagan &amp; Carter would have finished in a near-tie.
</p>

<h2> 1984 US Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
Reagan re-elected by "landslide" (58.8%) over Walter F. Mondale (40.6%).
In third was David Bergland with 0.3%.
We do not believe any reasonable election method would have changed that.
</p>

<h2> 1988 US Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
<b>Approval voting:</b>
NBC News/Wall Street Journal 
(they released this poll data on 18 November 1988)
asked 1721 US citizens by telephone:
"Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of
Michael Dukakis?" 
The same question was asked also of other presidential candidates or people and also at other 
dates.   Note: the Bentsen figures below, and those labeled CBSNYT,
are instead from a CBS/New York Times poll 8-10
October 1988 of 1009 "likely voters."
<small>
(There also was an ABC News/Washington Post Poll in September 1988 asking the same questions, but
I do not have that data.)
</small>
The results were:
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">

<tr><th>Lloyd BENTSEN [CBSNYT]</th><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>43/20</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Gallup asked 
1232 registered voters by telephone on 21-23 October 1988:
"Would Dukakis make a good president?" 
Results:
</p>
<pre>
Dukakis: 36% yes,  31% no,  33% don't know / no-opin
Bush I:  48% yes,  28% no,  24% don't know / no-opin
</pre>

<p>
Gallup asked 
1007 people US-wide by telephone on 7-9 October 1988:
"Is Dan Quayle qualified to be president?" Results:
</p>
<pre>
Quayle:   46% yes,  42% no,  12% no-opin
Bentsen:  76% yes,  11% no,  13% no-opin
</pre>

<p>
It appears from 
this data that Bush I would have won under approval as well as  (as he did)
under plurality voting, <i>except</i> that if Jesse Jackson had run (but 
in fact, Jackson dropped out
of the race after losing the Democratic Party nomination to Dukakis) then
it appears Jackson would have defeated Bush or come close.
And definitely Jackson would have beaten Dukakis
(based on this data) with approval voting.
However Jackson lost to Dukakis among both Democrat voters and
Republican pollees in the <i>plurality</i>-voting primaries and 
all Gallup polls
when the full or anyhow a substantial set of Dem-party contenders
were also present in that same primary or poll.  So here we appear to
have an example where the approval and plurality-voting winners 
(e.g. of the 1988 Democratic primary) differed. (Asterisk:
since these polls were taken at different <i>times</i> that conclusion
can be attacked.)  Finally, <b>Bentsen</b> it seems would have won the whole
ball of wax if he'd run under either range or approval voting.
</p>



<p><b>Range Voting:</b>
Gallup asked 4089 registered voters by telephone on 3-6 November 1998:
"Is your overall opinion of George Bush very favorable, mostly fav,
mostly unfav, or very unfav?" (And same for other candidates.)

<i>However</i> the Jackson poll data in the above table was <i>not</i> got by 
Gallup on Nov 3-6 but instead is based on combining two Gallup polls
of 1204 and 757 registered voters respectively taken on
21-23 April and 30-31 March.  It thus is a good deal less legitimate for
comparison purposes, indicated by using a different color for that row. 
It appears from the above data that the range-voting
winner would have been (if he had been running 
for president instead of vice president) Lloyd <b>Bentsen</b>!
</p>


<!--
in 1988 USA presidential rangevoting poll  (winner=Bentsen) I find
winner=Bush with medians provided NO-OPINION counted as zero.
But Bush also wins with average if Noop=0, so that wasn't really a discrepancy.
--

NY Times (23 Aug 1988) reports:
</p>
<blockquote>
Mr. Bush had one of his strongest personal ratings ever, with 39 percent saying they had a favorable view of him and 25 percent saying they had an unfavorable opinion. That compared to 27 percent favorable and 33 percent unfavorable at the beginning of the month.

The Democratic convention had boosted Mr. Dukakis's favorable rating to its highest level, at 38 percent favorable and 19 percent unfavorable in the early August survey. But in this CBS News Poll his rating settled back to 32 percent favorable and 25 percent unfavorable. 
</blockquote>


range voting (Louisianans only)...:
Question: On a thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 degrees. Ratings
between 50 and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm
toward that person. Ratings between 1 and 50 degrees mean that you
don't feel too favorable and are cool toward that person. You may use
any number from 1 to 100 to tell me how favorable or unfavorable your
feelings are for each person. If you don't feel particularly warm or
cold toward the person, you would rate the person at the 50 degree
mark. How would you rate Bruce Babbitt?

<h2> 1992 US Presidential Election: Range(1-7) poll, Approval poll, Plurality vote </h2>

<p>
<b>Approval voting:</b>
We combine this New York Times telephone poll of 1854 US citizens (on 23 Oct. 1992)
"Is your opinion of Ross Perot favorable, not favorable,
undecided, or haven't you heard enough about him yet to have an
opinion?" (same question also asked for Bush &amp; Clinton)
with the result of an independent 
Gallup telephone poll of 1579 US citizens (on 31 Oct. 1992) [almost identical question phrasing
except "undecided" and "don't know" lumped into one].
The results (for all 3433 pollees; note some rows may not sum to exactly 100% due
to integer twice-roundoff effects) are as follows:

<p>
An exit poll by
"Voter Research and Surveys" (reported in <i>NY Times</i> 5 Nov. 1992)
found that Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush and 38% from Clinton, 
while the rest of his voters either would have stayed home or voted for somebody else
had he not been on ballot.  This indicates Clinton still would have won
using "instant runoff voting" and also indicates Perot clearly did not play a "spoiler" role;
his candidacy did not affect the election result.
</p><p>
It also indicates that at least 
43.0+18.9&times;0.375=50.1% of the voters were "Clinton&gt;Bush"
voters (i.e. if they'd provided full preference orders as votes, at least 50.1% would
have ordered Clinton above Bush). Does this mean that Clinton was
a <a href="Glossary.html#condwin">Condorcet winner</a>?
No, because it remains conceivable that, e.g. all Bush-voters preferred Perot&gt;Clinton
in which case Perot would have been preferred over Clinton by &ge;56.3 of
the voters.  (Perot would have needed at least 86% of Bush voters to feel that way,
to beat Clinton pairwise.)
However, that didn't happen because
NES "thermometer" data indicates Clinton indeed was a Condorcet winner.
<small>
(To quote the analysis of that data from the Brams-Merrill paper:
"Clinton is easily the Condorcet winner, beating Bush 953.5 to 687.5 
and Perot 1038.5 to 585.5. Bush beats Perot in a relatively close race, 865.5 to 761.5."
They also remark:
"<a href="Glossary.html#Borda">Borda</a>
totals for the three candidates are: Clinton 2,017.5; Bush 1,577.0; and Perot 1,379.5,"
where I presume they are artificially excluding candidates besides these three.)

<b>Effect of Perot:</b>
CNN/Gallup polls were conducted of 866 registered voters
in which pollees were given a 3-way choice {Clinton,Dole,Perot} and a 2-way forced choice 
{Clinton,Dole}
via "If Bill Clinton and Bob Dole were the only candidates running for     
president in 1996, who would you vote for?"  
This allows us to enquire about Perot's effect &ndash; did he act as a "spoiler" and for whom?
It appears that Perot, by running, hurt Dole (i.e. more Perot voters
supported Dole than Clinton), based on the early polls (April).
But in later polls (May &amp; July) the situation reversed, and Perot by running seems
instead to have hurt Clinton.   So in 1996 just like in 1992, Perot was <i>not</i> a "spoiler" who
ruined the election for Dole; instead if anything Perot's run hurt Clinton and helped Dole (relatively)
albeit not by enough to alter the winner.

<b>Head-to-head matchups &amp; Condorcet voting:</b> 
A CNN/USA-Today/Gallup poll released  13 Dec. 1999 (phone interviews with 1037 adult Americans)
found <b>McCain</b> would defeat Gore
52% to 44% in a hypothetical head-to-head race. 
Gallup also asked this again in late February 2000, finding a landslide win for
McCain: 59% versus Gore's 35%.
And of course, Gore beat Bush by a small margin in
an effectively-2-way race &ndash; the official popular vote &ndash; although Gallup polls
during this early period (Feb. 2000) predicted the opposite (53% to 44% win for Bush over Gore;
sampling error &plusmn;5 %points).   This poll also predicted both McCain and Bush would defeat
Bradley head-to-head, although again McCain would beat him bigger.  However, Bush easily
defeated McCain in this poll among Republican voters <i>only</i>: 56% to 34% in a hypothetical
2-way matchup.  (Later, McCain gained on Bush, but not by enough to win the Republican nomination.)
</p><p>
If it really is true that the US public as a whole (not just Republican primary voters)
preferred Bush over McCain, then that demonstrates a 
<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>
</p><center>
Bush &gt; McCain &gt; Gore &gt; Bush;
</center><p>
but if instead (which seems more likely)
McCain would have defeated Bush USA-wide then McCain was the beats-all winner
among these three.
</p><a name="Burden"></a><p>
From
<a href="Burden.pdf">Burden's paper</a>:
"Examining the pre-election rankings (NES 'feeling theormometer' data), <b>Nader</b> beats
Buchanan (659-240), Gore (527-500), and Bush (562-491), thus making
him the <i>Condorcet winner.</i>  Nearly every other [voting] method makes Gore the
winner."  
<i>But</i> this is only if voters ranking Nader with "don't know" are excluded, or
treated as midrange score (evidently the former).  
If these voters instead are regarded as rating Nader 0, then Gore is the Condorcet winner.
The USA-wide popular-vote winner (in this case Gore) has been the Condorcet winner
in every US presidential election studied by the NES under the latter convention.
The reason Nader did so poorly in the official election (Burden found
from the 
<a href="http://electionstudies.org">NES</a> data) is that
<i>over 90% of people who rated Buchanan or Nader highest did not vote for them</i>,
i.e. the voting was dominated by strategic dishonesty!
</p><p>
But <b>Gore</b> wins based on the NES data using either "instant runoff,"
"range voting,"
or "Borda count."
</p>
<p>
<b>Instant Runoff:</b>
This race, incidentally, is a good example of where <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
(instant runoff voting) would 
have failed America in a 3-way McCain vs Gore vs Bush race where we assume
McCain would have continued running
as a 3rd-party or independent candidate.   McCain would have been the
true-democratic 
winner in that race, based on our polls, range voting, approval voting, and the fact 
Bush voters tended to prefer McCain over Gore, and Gore voters tended to prefer McCain over Bush,
making McCain the "Condorcet (beats-all) winner."  (As the head-to-head polls agreed too.)
However, with IRV, McCain presumably would have been
"eliminated" and thus unable to benefit from "vote transfers" from either Gore or Bush.
Thus IRV would, in this race, have behaved the same as plain plurality voting.
</p>

<b>Approval voting:</b>
The above Dec. 1999 
poll also asked the voters' opinion of McCain ("favorable" or "unfavorable") and found
57% favorable versus 11% unfavorable; by Feb. 2000 (new poll based on interviews with
1018 American "likely voters") 
this had grown to 67/12
while for Bush  it was 63/31, for Gore  57/37, and for Bradley 63/18.
This indicates <b>McCain</b> 
would have won the presidency (versus those rivals) with approval voting
(at least, in Feb. 2000); also note Bradley would have beaten Bush.
</p>
<p>
There also was a Gallup poll 14-16  July 2000 finding for Nader 42% favorable, 22% unfavorable, 
36% other (e.g. "don't know");
for 
<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141269/favorable-ratings-gore-down-cheney-biden-flat.aspx">Gore</a>
52-64% favorable and 30-46% unfavorable (fluctuated on poll dates during Jan-Nov 2000;
Gallup's final Gore figures by election day were F=52, U=46);
and for 
<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/144350/book-tour-begins-george-bush-favorable-rating.aspx">Bush</a> 
about 55-66% favorability and 36-39% unfavorability
(fluctuations during late 2000).
This indicates <b>Bush</b> or <b>Gore</b> would have won (with the most "favorables")
although <b>Nader</b> might well have been the winner in the sense of having the greatest
F/U <i>ratio</i> (ignoring "don't knows").
But an ABC News/Washington Post poll of registered voters released 8 Sept. 2000 found only
31% favorable and 29% unfavorable for Nader, contradicting that.

<h2> 2007 French Presidential Election </h2>

(also some 
<a href="OrsayTable.html">details</a> on range-type substudy).
</p>
<p>
Sarkozy won (also would have won with IRV), 
but Bayrou would have won with score and approval voting.
Bayrou was clearly the winner France preferred both at the time
(e.g, beat every rival pairwise, said polls) and later, in hindsight,
based on more polls.

ABC News/Washington Post asked 1108 people by telephone on August 19-22 2008

McCain? Do you feel that way strongly or somewhat?" (Also Obama.)

It appears from the data 
here that <b>Obama</b> still would have been the winner with either Approval or Range.
</p>

<p>
<b>Range(1-5):</b>
Zohopolls.com, a commercial polling site, ran a range(1-5) poll  of
numerous early candidates for the US president (including many political figures
who eventually did <i>not</i> actually run,
and even including one <i>fictional person</i> and several actors and comedians).
The poll, created by <a href="">rangevoting.org</a> member Clay Shentrup,
began in September 2006 and continued until February 2009.
There were 5785 <i>self selected</i>  voters.  That is, anybody in the world
with a net-browser who happened
to browse to the <a href="http://zohopolls.com/us/pres">zohopolls.com</a>
website and wanted to participate, 
could.  (And if you clicked on any candidate name, you got a window with the wikipedia article 
about that candidate.)
Voters could refuse to score candidates, in which case their scores only affected
the averages for the subset of the candidates whom they <i>did</I> score.
There were measures 
(which seem to have been successful; 
although sufficiently determined hackers probably could have defeated
these measures, apparently they did not try)
to prevent people from voting more than once.  
Unlike most polls, any voter could <i>examine</i> the results-so-far of the poll-so-far and
could <i>change</i> any or all of
her votes over time &ndash; but only the last change counted!
</p>
<p>
Here are the (Feb. 2009, but nobody's score moved more than &plusmn;0.02 since November 2008) 
results.  We have put asterisks(*)
next to "candidates" who in fact were not US politicians
but instead were actors, commentators, fictional, or non-US citizens &ndash; but in the actual poll
no such marks were present.

<h2> 2009 </h2>

<p>
The four most-important-to-the-USA elections of 2009 
are examined <a href="Nov09PR.html">here</a> (and subpages
<a href="Races2009.html">1</a>,
<a href="AfghanVoting.html">2</a>).
In two of the first three cases democracy (based on plurality voting)
severely malfunctioned; range
or approval voting would have behaved reasonably but 
instant runoff voting (IRV) would not have.  
In the fourth case, the election was fraudulent and IRV would
have made things even more of a mess.
</p>

<h2> 2012  France Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
See <a href="France2012.html">this page</a>.
Hollande still would have won with several flavors of score voting and
approval voting.  But the second-place finisher probably would have changed.
</p>

<h2> 2012 Egypt Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
See <a href="Egypt2012.html">this page</a>.
The official system &ndash; plurality plus 2-man runoff &ndash;
malfunctioned because both finalists
Morsi and Shafik apparently won due to vote-splits among their rivals.
It appears from poll data that the Condorcet and score-voting winner
was either Moussa or Sabahi, neither of whom made it into the official final round.
Morsi's approval ratings plunged while in office from about 75% to about 25%
and then after only 1 year he was overthrown by a coup with wide popular support.
However, Morsi's remaining supporters justifiably objected to his overthrow
(since he was legitimately elected using the official rules)
and as of 2013 the situation remains unclear with possible decay of Egypt into 
chaos, military dictatorship, or new rebooted democracy all possible.
</p>

<h2> 2012  USA Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
See <a href="USA2012primary.html">this study</a>.
Obama still would have won with either Approval or Range voting (versus all rivals
we have those-kinds-of-voting data on), but the second place finisher might
have been any of
</p>
<center>
{Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, Mitt Romney, or Rick Santorum}
</center>
<p>
among those candidates we have data for. (Also, we <i>lack</i>
such data for 
Gary Johnson, Buddy Roemer, and Jill Stein.)
The Republican Primary race featured crazy plurality-voting pathologies and
disserved both that party and the USA as a whole.
</p><p>
Both Obama and Romney had about 50:50
approval:disapproval ratio (each), while Stein and Johnson each had about 33:66, which
was less than O &amp; R, but indicates their true support (undistorted by
"fear of wasting vote")  far exceeded that indicated by their official plurality voting
totals (both below 1% each), in yet another all-too-typical enormous distortion of democracy.

<h2> 2016  USA Presidential Election </h2>

<p>
See <a href="USA2016retro.html">this study</a>.
Donald Trump won with the official procedure based on plurality voting
with an electoral college.
Sanders or Kasich would have won with score voting,
and Sanders with approval voting.
Under "popular vote,"
H.Clinton wins with approval voting restricted to the 4 finalists
{Clinton, Trump, Johnson, Stein}
as well as with plurality voting;
with score voting restricted to these 4 it could have been any of
{Clinton, Trump, Johnson}; too close to call which.
Clinton was a "spoiler" but Johnson and Stein weren't.

<h2> Summary </h2>

<p>
In many of these elections, range or approval voting would not have
changed the winner and the whole election would have come out
approximately the same.
However, in others, range or approval <i>would</i> have changed either
the winner, the finish-order among the top few, or both.
Also, in some elections the winner with range or approval would have been 
different if <i>that candidate had run</i> but thanks to the "to avoid
wasting your vote, you must vote for one of the 'top two'" mindset
of plurality voting
that candidate was discouraged from running, did not run, and hence could not win.
Specifically:
</p>
<ul><li>
In USA 1980 John <b>Anderson</b> would have done far
better with Approval voting &ndash;
finishing comparable or perhaps even
ahead of Carter, although he could not have won.
With Range Voting Carter would have been comparable to Reagan, not far behind.
</li><li>
In USA 1988 our data is inadequate and these conclusions can be criticized,
but anyhow as far as it goes it suggests Jesse Jackson (if he had continued to run)
would have finished comparable with Bush and ahead of Dukakis with
approval voting; and senator 
<b>Lloyd Bentsen</b> would have finished ahead of <i>everybody</i> if he had
run for president instead of vice president and if range 
or approval voting had been used.
</li><li>
In USA 1992, <b>H.Ross Perot</b> could not have won, but would have done far better
(comparably to Bush) with either range or approval voting.
</li><li>
In USA 2000, <b>Ralph Nader</b> would have done far better with approval voting
(exceeding Bush) and <b>John McCain</b> would have done even better still
(if he had continued to run) exceeding both Bush, Gore, and Nader to win the presidency
with either range, approval, or Condorcet (but not <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>) voting!
Gore would also have defeated Bush in Florida with either range or
approval voting, so that Bush would not have won.
</li><li>
In France 2002, <b>Le Pen</B> would have done far 
<i>worse</i> under approval voting,
and Jospin and Chirac would have finished comparably, perhaps
altering the winner or perhaps it would still be Chirac.
</li><li>
In USA 2004, <b>Ralph Nader</b> would have done far better with range or
approval voting &ndash;
not enough to boost him out of third place, but enough to finish in the same
vote-total "ballpark"
as Bush and Kerry.  Also with range voting, every third-party candidate would
have <a href="PsEl04.html">gotten</a>
far more votes (usually a factor of 10 or even 1000 times more)
relative to Bush &amp; Kerry.  This would have represented far more accurately
what the electorate actually wanted.
</li><li>
In France 2007, range voting (either 
<a href="MedianVrange.html">median</a>- or average-based)
would have changed the winner from Sarkozy to <b>Bayrou</b>,
at least based on the 1752 Orsay range-voters who were <a href="OrsayTable.html">studied</a>.   
And clearly Bayrou would have done
far better than he did with plurality+top2-runoff (where he came third).
This switch probably would have been an improvement since nationwide
polls indicated Bayrou would have beaten every rival in a head-to-head race
with that rival.
</li><li>
In 2009, two of the three most-watched elections in the USA malfunctioned severely under
plurality voting, ranking the most-probable winner with range, approval, or Condorcet voting 
far-last.  (All three candidates were near-equal under either range or approval voting.)
The same huge distortion would also have occurred using instant runoff voting (IRV).
