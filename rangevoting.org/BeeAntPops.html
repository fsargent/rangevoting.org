<H1>  Bee and Ant populations; comparison versus Humans </H1>
<p><small>Warren D. Smith, July 2021.</small></p>
<p>
How many bees and ants are there, and how long have they been around?
Why do I ask?
Bees and ants are <a href="ApisMellifera.html">known</a> to hold democratic elections,
and I want to compare them numerically, as democrats, versus humankind.
</p><p>
First of all, how much of <i>every</i> kind of life is there?
Some people measure "mass," some "dry mass," but the former can vary with hydration while
the latter term is imprecisely defined.  A more precise unit therefore is recommended by
Bar-On, Phillip & Milo in their 2018 world biomass census:
total mass of whatever species' <i>carbon atoms</i>.
They claim
(unfortunately with rather large uncertainties for some kinds of life)
that, e.g. the total carbon mass of humanity
(pop. 7 billion at that time)
is 0.06 gigatons,
and of their livestock 0.1 gigatons.
The wild mammals and birds
are only 0.007 and 0.002 gigatons respectively, which demonstrates how completely humanity had already taken over
and killed the Natural World by 2018.
</p><p>
<!-- In terms of numbers of individuals, insects seem by far the most common land animals.-->
Wilson &amp; H&ouml;lldobler 2005 claim <b>ants</b> constitute "at least 1/3 of all insect biomass."
<!--and estimate there are between 10<sup>15</sup> and 10<sup>16</sup> ants
But 10^15 to 10^16 Ants at 1-10 milligram each, would mass (1-100)*10^9 kg.
Humans at 50 kg avg each would (if 7 Billion, year 2013) be 350*10^9 kg. Oops.
"If we were to weigh all the ants in the world, they would weigh as much as all of the people."  really?
This claim was originally made by Harvard University professor Edward O Wilson, and the German
biologist Bert Hoelldobler, in their 1994 book Journey To The Ants.
They based their estimate on an earlier one by British entomologist C B Williams, who once calculated that the
number of INSECTS alive on earth at a given moment was 10^17 to 10^19.
Wilson and Hoelldobler: "Individual workers weigh on average between 1 to 5 mg, according to the species."
Francis Ratnieks, Professor of Apiculture at the University of Sussex: "The common ants which live in British gardens weigh 1-2mg."
-->
<b>Termites</b> are the insect that has been counted most carefully due to their economic importance.
They are estimated to <i>outmass humanity</i>: Sanderson 1996 counted 0.05 or 0.07 gigatons of carbon in termites,
according to 2 different claims about Sanderson both(!) made in Bar-On et al 2018, the latter seeming more valid.
<i>If</i> we believe Wilson &amp; H&ouml;lldobler's "&ge;1/3" claim, then
that suggests, e.g. based on Bar-On, et al's central estimates for insect mass &ndash;
and the claim by 
Nyffeler &amp; Birkhofer 2017 that  400-800 megatonnes of prey are consumed each year by spiders,
more than the total mass (287 megatonnes) of humanity as weighed by Walpole et al 2012 &ndash;
that <i>ants also have mass comparable to humanity</i>.
If so, and if the average ant weighs 3 milligrams, then there are perhaps 5&times;10<sup>16</sup> ants.
</p><p>
However, I warn you that various numbers I've seen confidently proclaimed in biology literature about ants,
definitely are wrong since they contradict one another.
And there are large error bars on many of Bar-On et al's biomass estimates.
Exercise caution when reading claims, based on zero cited evidence,
such as [Schultz 2000] that on average, ants "monopolize 15-20% of the terrestrial animal biomass,
and in tropical regions where ants are especially abundant, they monopolize 25% or more."
</p><p>
The UN FAO (United Nations Food &amp; Agriculture organization)
keeps track of many things, including how many domesticated beehives there are in the world.
They counted 90999730 during year 2017, i.e. roughly 10<sup>8</sup> hives.
(In the 2019 USA alone: 2669000 hives.)
Each such beehive contains, on average, about 20000 bees (more during summer, fewer in winter),
for a total domesticated <b>honeybee</b> population of about 2&times;10<sup>12</sup> individuals,
which if they each weighed 150 milligrams would total 0.3 megatonnes, i.e. about 1/1000 the mass of humanity.
Undomesticated, i.e. wild, bee numbers are far less clear.
However Jordan et al 2021 estimated the total economic value of USA bees as pollinators
was $34 billion/year in 2012,
while Reilly et al 2020 estimated
the value of wild pollination services in USA at $1.5 billion/year.
This suggests that in agricultural areas (which currently constitute about 50% of
the Earth's ice-free land area) wild bees have about 5% of domesticated bee pollination-power,
and hence, very roughly, 5% of their mass. In non-agricultural areas,
wild bees presumably are nearly 100% of the bees, and probably more numerous than
in agricultural areas since agricultural crop monocultures are nutritionally unhealthy for bees.
So it is probably safe to estimate that to get the total (wild+domesticated) bee mass, we should multiply
the domestic-only mass by something between 1.05 and 3.
</p><p>
Ants are 140-168 Myr <b>old</b> according to sources collected by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant#Taxonomy_and_evolution#Taxonomy_and_evolution">wikipedia</a>.
Bees are 100 Myr old, as was realized after a bee was found trapped in amber that old
(<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061209083342.htm">Two Studies On Bee Evolution Reveal Surprises</a>,
Cornell Univ. press release to<i> Science Daily</i> 14 Dec. 2006).
This is pretty new information as of the present date 2021;
previously it was thought bees and ants were only about half this old.
</p><p>
In view of both their total tonnage and longetivity,
Schultz 2000 called ants
"<i>arguably the greatest success story in the history of terrestrial [i.e. non-marine] metazoa</i>."
That would have made sense if Schultz had not forgotten that termites are comparably successful.
</p>
<h3> Insects as democrats </h3>
<p>
There are exactly two known classes of nonhuman animals with lives affected in
a major way by voting in &ge;3-candidate elections:
<a href="ApisMellifera.html">bees</a> and ants.
Honeybees annually democratically vote to select a new hive location.
Certain ants also conduct such a vote if their nest is destroyed.
Regard those as independent Darwinian experiments, for bees 100 megayears 
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061209083342.htm">long</a>
comprised of 10<sup>16</sup> individual elections.
<!--  https://www.businessinsider.com/insects-dying-off-sign-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-2                                                                                                                                   "In the US, the number of honey-bee colonies dropped from 6 million in 1947 to 2.5 million just six decades later."                                                                                                          citing F.Sanchez-Bayo et al 2019.  6M in USA would mean about 100M bee colonies worldwide,                                                                                                                                   which over 100M years is 10^16 = 10 quadrillion  elections. -->
That's over 10<sup>6</sup>&times; more elections than humankind ever
(even computer simulations cannot reach bee numbers!).
[Lawless 2012
in a table found there are 519682 elected officials in USA, mostly town and county governments and school districts.
So the total number of human elections thoughout all history ought to be &lt;4000 times that, i.e. 2&times;10<sup>9</sup>,
and at least 2&times;10<sup>8</sup>.]   
The bees did it
during a timespan &gt;10<sup>3</sup>&times; longer,
comprising &asymp;10<sup>5</sup>&times; more generations.
Even today honeybees exceed
200&times; human population and run &gt;10&times;
more elections each year than humans &ndash;
<i>and</i> with those elections closer-linked
to each bee-voter's survival chances, than elections matter to almost all human voters.
That makes bees an indicator <i>at least</i> 10<sup>6</sup>&times; more sensitive than humans.
Democrats: Ignore bees at your peril.
</p><p>
Similar remarks apply for ants given that they are 140-168 Myr
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant#Taxonomy_and_evolution#Taxonomy_and_evolution">old</a>
<!-- <a href="https://expeditions.fieldmuseum.org/australian-ants/ant-evolution-and-environment">old</a> -->
and outnumber bees &gt;10<sup>4</sup>&times;.

At the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization website, FAOSTAT, you can now download the latest 2017 data
on the number of managed bee hives worldwide across 125 countries (though not my own country, the UK!). The individual country data can be
downloaded as a juicy detailed spreadsheet or the data can be visualised in interactive attractive graphs for you in the
Visualize data section -- this tells us that there was a worldwide total of 90,999,730 hives (up slightly from 90,564,654 hives in 2016).
In USA alone: 2,669,000 hives in year 2019.

So based on that, wild bees preumably are 1/20 of domesticate bees in agricultral areas, hence about 1/10 summed over all areas.

In North Carolina, soil samples to a depth of 5 inches yielded a calculation that there were approximately 124 million animals per acre, of which 
90 million were mites, 28 million were springtails, and 4.5 million were other insects. 
Neither springtails nor mites count as insects.
Mites are small arachnids (eight-legged arthropods).
A similar study in Pennsylvania yielded figures of
425 million animals per acre, with 209 million mites, 119 million springtails, and 11 million other arthropods...
There are more than 200 million insects for each human on the planet.
  These NC+PA studies extrapolate to 10^19 land animals worldwide, almost all of them insects. Perhaps 1% are ants.

Bar-On's unit of biomass is grams carbon per sq meter, or also (whole earth) Gtonnes carbon (GtC).
Restricting to macroscopic land animals:
Annelids contain both marine and terrestrial species - dominant
contributions the terrestrial earthworms and the worm family Enchytraeidae. 0.2 GtC on land
Nematodes contain both marine and terrestrial species.                    0.006 GtC on land. 
Chordates:
 Humans           0.06  GtC
 Domestic animals 0.1   GtC
 Wild mammals     0.007 GtC
 Wild birds       0.002 GtC
 Reptiles         0.003 GtC
 Amphibians       0.1   GtC  very crude estim
 Land Arthropods  0.2 GtC   (global insect pop 10^18 say Holldobler+Wilson.  Somebody else 10^19.)
They extrapolate samplings by Williams and others to ice-free terrestrial surface area of 1.3*10^14 m^2.
Also termites alone = 0.07 GtC.
