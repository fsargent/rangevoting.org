<H2> Voting about two events; and the demise of naive majoritarianism </H2>
<p>
<small>Clay Shentrup &amp; Warren D. Smith, Aug 2015</small>
</p>
<p>
Suppose that somewhere in the universe, there exist 
two possible events X and Y, and three voters Amy, Bob, and Cal,
such that each of the voters has the following 
(see table) personal valuations for X and Y;
and they each will simply value
the combined event X&amp;Y as the <i>sum</i> of their X and Y values.
</p><p>
<small>
The four possible combination-outcomes are 
&empty; (i.e. neither X nor Y happen), just X, just Y, and "X&amp;Y
both happen,"
For simplicity we're assuming each of our voters values X and Y <i>independently</i>; i.e.
the value of X (in the view of each voter) is unaffected by whether Y happens, and vice versa.
One also could consider 
voters for whom X and Y are dependent events, e.g. the value of X
to such a voter would depend on whether Y happens.   Then our examples would
still work provided the voters value X and Y nearly-enough to independently, e.g.
the effects of Y on the value of X, and vice versa, are small enough.
</small>
</p><p>
Example election #1:
</p>
<table bgcolor="yellow" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr bgcolor="pink">
<th>Voter</th>
<th>X value</th>
<th>Y value</th>
<th>combination values<br>
&empty;, &nbsp;&nbsp; X, &nbsp;&nbsp; Y, &nbsp; X&amp;Y
</th></tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Amy</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center"><b>&ndash;</b>6</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Bob</td>
<td align="center"><b>&ndash;</b>6</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Cal</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
What would happen if we handled this election with
<b>simple-majority 2-choice votes?</b>
</p><p>
In election #1 using simple majority votes:
</p><ol><li>
 X would be <i>enacted</i> by 2:1 majority (Amy &amp; Cal) whether or not Y was.
</li><li>
 Y would be <i>enacted</i> by 2:1 majority (Bob &amp; Cal) whether or not X was.
</li><li>
 "X&amp;Y" would be <i>defeated</i> by 2:1 majority (voters Amy &amp; Bob)
versus "neither" (&empty;)!
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>These three simple majority votes <i>contradict</i> each other.</b>
</p><p>
This makes us realize that the naive philosophy that "the majority should win"
in any simple-majority two-choice vote, is logically <i>untenable.</i>
</p><p>
Example election #2 (same as election #1, except Cal replaced by Deb):
</p>
<table bgcolor="lightgreen" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr bgcolor="orange">
<th>Voter</th>
<th>X value</th>
<th>Y value</th>
<th>combination values<br>
&empty;, &nbsp;&nbsp; X, &nbsp;&nbsp; Y, &nbsp; X&amp;Y
</th></tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Amy</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center"><b>&ndash;</b>6</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Bob</td>
<td align="center"><b>&ndash;</b>6</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&ndash;</b>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Deb</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The exact same three simple majority votes would happen in election #2
(except replace "Cal" by "Deb").
</p>
<p>
Given that naive majoritarianism is untenable, what should replace it?
We believe the best available philosophy is
&quot;<a href="Bentham.html">utilitarianism</a>.&quot;
I.e, if these two example elections had been decided by summing
everybody's honest valuations
of all 4 options, then the summed-scores would have been
</p>
<table bgcolor="#DDDDFF" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
<tr bgcolor="yellow">
<th>Election #1</th>
<td>&empty;=0</td>
<td>X=1</td>
<td>Y=2</td>
<th>X&amp;Y=3</th>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="lightgreen">
<th>Election #2</th>
<th>&empty;=0</th>
<td>X=<b>&ndash;</b>1</td>
<td>Y=<b>&ndash;</b>2</td>
<td>X&amp;Y=<b>&ndash;</b>3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
We devised the two example elections so that their sums-of-honest-scores yield 
exactly opposite conclusions.
But neither election features any self-contradiction, and their respective winners
would have been the best (reckoned by summed honest values) for their respective societies.
</p>
<p>
The philosophy of utilitarianism would be instantiated by
"honest <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>."
I.e, if these two example elections had been held using <!--0-to-9--> score voting on
all 4 options, their summed-score winners with <i>honest</i> scores 
would indeed have been X&amp;Y and &empty; respectively.
</p><p>
However, in 2-choice elections score voting degenerates to simple-majority voting
if all voters "exaggerate" their scores to the max and min ends of the allowed-score range.
So with all-exaggerating voters, the same contradictions would happen if the same three
2-choice elections were held.  With a full 4-choice election, score voting
with honest votes would enact X&amp;Y in election #1 but neither (&empty;) in election #2;
but with "normalized" scores (i.e. honest scores <i>except</i>
each voter scales them to employ the full 
allowed-score interval), both elections with 4-choice score voting
would elect X&amp;Y
&ndash; which in election #1 would be the best, but in election #2 the worst, possible outcome.
With honest-voter
plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting 
both elections would yield 
3-way exact ties between X, Y, and X&amp;Y.
With <a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff</a> IRV
election #1 would be a 2-way tie between Y and X&amp;Y;
with Condorcet systems it would be a
a <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">cycle</a> "&empty; &gt; X&amp;Y &gt; Y &gt; X &gt; &empty;."
</p>
<a name="NoValues"></a>
<h3>What if you don't like voters who have numerical values in mind?</h3>
<p>
Or you just don't like numerical valuation <i>at all</i>?  No problemo... Example election #3:
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr bgcolor="pink">
<th>#Voters</th>
<th>Their preferences</th>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">35%</td>
<td align="center">X &gt; &empty; &gt; X&amp;Y &gt; Y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">33%</td>
<td align="center">Y &gt; &empty; &gt; X&amp;Y &gt; X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">32%</td>
<td align="center">X&amp;Y &gt; X &gt; Y &gt; &empty;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this version, the voters have only preference orderings among the 4 
possible outcomes.
If we handled this election with
simple-majority 2-choice votes:
</p><ol><li>
 X would be <i>enacted</i> by 67:33 majority whether or not Y was.
</li><li>
 Y would be <i>enacted</i> by 65:35 majority whether or not X was.
</li><li>
 "X&amp;Y" would be <i>defeated</i> by 68:32 majority 
versus "neither" (&empty;)!
</li></ol>
<p>
Again, <b>these three simple majority votes <i>contradict</i> each other.</b>
</p><p>
<small>
Plain plurality, Borda, and IRV all would choose "X" in this situation with honest
preference orderings as votes, but Condorcet systems would regard it as
a <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">cycle</a> "&empty; &gt; X&amp;Y &gt; X &gt; Y &gt; &empty;."
Approval voting (if all voters approved top two) would choose &empty;.
</small>
</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<ul><li>
Naive majoritarianism is logically untenable.  
</li><li>
This is shown by a very simple
election example about only two events X and Y.
</li><li>
Utilitarianism is free from logical self-contradictions, but
in the real world of dishonest, exaggerating, colluding voters,
there is no way to implement it perfectly via a voting system.
</li><li>
The best voting systems are the ones best approximating utilitarianism.
A way to measure how close they come, is <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.
</li><li>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score voting</a> in tests has one of the lowest Bayesian Regrets
among commonly-proposed voting systems,
with either honest, or dishonest/strategic voters, or any mixture.
</li></ul>
