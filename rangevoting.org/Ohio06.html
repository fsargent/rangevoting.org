<H2> The Ohio 2006 Governor Race </H2>

<p>
In the 2004 US presidential election, the critical state on which everything turned was 
<a href="Ohio04.html">Ohio</a>.
Bush beat Kerry in Ohio, thus winning the presidency.
Bush was vastly aided in this quest by J.Kenneth Blackwell, the man in charge of
Ohio elections who was simultaneously the Bush-Cheney Ohio campaign co-chair.
</p>

<p>
Bob Fitrakis, lawyer, professor of political science
at Columbus State Community College,  
and journalist,
is the Editor of The Columbus
<a href="http://www.freepress.org">Free Press</a>.
He won  ten major investigative journalism awards including 
"Best Coverage of Politics in Ohio" from the 
Ohio Society of Professional Journalists.
Fitrakis grew disgusted with the rampant
<a href="Spoiled.html#ohio">election-manipulation techniques</a> orchestrated by Blackwell
that the <i>Free Press</i> exposed during the Ohio 2004 Bush-Kerry race.
Fitrakis became even more disgusted when the Libertarian and Green parties filed
for a recount of that race &ndash; and then 
both claimed that the "recount" they got was wholy inadequate and illegal under
Ohio law &ndash; a contention later supported by a
<a href="PlainDealerOHrec.html">special prosecutor</a> 
and then the 
<a href="OhioConvictns.html">jury's convictions</a> 
&ndash;
and sued.
Fitrakis undoubtably was even more disgusted when
Kerry and the Democratic party, amazingly enough,
did <i>not</i> ask for a recount, leaving that to the Greens and Libertarians,
even though  they obviously had the most to gain and even though
the <a href="RollingStoneOH.html">Rolling Stone</a> analysis
claimed Kerry quite probably should have won.
(<a href="LessFraud.html#thy">Why did Kerry opt out?</a>)
</p>

<p>
So in 2006 Fitrakis
announced his candidacy for governor of Ohio on the 
<a href="http://www.greenparty.org/">Green Party</a> ticket,
running  on an election-reform platform.
</p>

<p>
Fitrakis was aided by the fact that sitting Ohio governor Bob Taft had
become embroiled in <a href="TaftEthics.html">corruption scandals</a>.  
The Republican party
then chose to run <i>J.Kenneth Blackwell</i>
for Governor, allowing him to <i>run his own election</i>
while <i>remaining in office</i>
as the highest Ohio election official with hire-and-fire power
over anybody in the system!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the Democrats chose congressman (and former 
minister and assistant psychology professor)
Ted Strickland.
</p>

<p>
Now considering the immense unpopularity of the Republicans at that point, it
might have appeared that Strickland would have an easy
landslide victory (June polls found him leading 
Blackwell 52 to 36 percent) &ndash; but perhaps not
with Blackwell supervising his own election!  
Also, it seemed plausible that Strickland and
Fitrakis might <i>split the vote</i>, causing both to lose even if a majority of the voters 
preferred both over Blackwell!
</p>

<p>
That "spoiler" pathology of course would not happen if we 
had <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>,
but it was highly likely under plurality voting.
</p>

<p>
So then, just to make Fitrakis have a harder time,
he was placed on the Ohio ballot <i>not</i> under the "Green Party" flag,
but rather as "Other-party candidate"!
This was due to Ohio election laws specially designed to discriminate against
third parties.
</p>

<p>
So then the question became: how much would Blackwell abuse the power of
his office to bias and manipulate
his own election?
This <a href="NYTimesEdBlackwell7June.html">New York Times editorial</a>
reports.
</p>

<h2>
Postscript (Feb 2007)
</h2>
<p>
Strickland won with 60.5% of the vote.
However, there is reason to believe the vote was manipulated against him:
The <i>Columbus Dispatch</i>'s  poll, ending the Friday before the Tuesday election,
predicted Strickland would get 67&plusmn;1.2% (standard error bars).
The <a href="NormTble.html">chance</a> of a deviation this large or larger 
was therefore below 1 in 3 million.
The <i>Dispatch</i> noted:
"The survey's 7-point [discrepancy] broke a string of five straight gubernatorial elections 
in which the poll exactly matched the victor's share of the vote."
This gives you an idea of the magnitude of the manipulation.
</p><p>
In 2004, Bush beat Kerry in Ohio by a margin of 118,775 votes (figure officially
certified by Blackwell after
the "recount"; this figure ignores over 92,000 machine rejected ballots and 14,000 provisional
ballots that were never counted and which probably would have heavily favored Kerry because
provisional and rejected ballots occurred predominantly in Kerry-supporting areas.
E.g. Kerry got 54.5% of the 147,400 provisional and absentee ballots that were counted 
<i>after</i> election night, all of which, incidentally, were counted by <i>hand</i>.)
This margin represented 2.1% of the &asymp;5.7 million votes cast.
