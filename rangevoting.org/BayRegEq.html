<H2> Bayesian Regret of Single-Winner Election Methods as one Big Fat Equation </H2>

<p>
People wanted to see "the formula" for <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.   
Actually, I'd never written
the whole thing all in <i>one</i> whacking big
equation before. But doing so has educational value, 
so here goes:
</p>

<p>
Let's unpack that:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>C</b>
</td><td>Is the set of candidates, and |C| is its cardinality (i.e. the number of candidates).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>V</b>
</td><td>Is the set of voters, and |V| is its cardinality.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>E</b>
</td><td>Is the election method, and BR(E) is its Bayesian Regret [and the whole point of the
formula is to tell you how to calculate BR(E)].</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>S</b>
</td><td>Denotes the strategy used by the voters to choose their votes. (For example, S
could be "honest voting."  A more-sophisticated S might be
"a 53-47 mix of 'artificially demote my favorite's top rival to bottom' with 'honest'.")
Note that BR depends upon S as well as E.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>M</b>
</td><td>Denotes the probability measure (on the space of utilities).
Note that BR depends upon M as well as E.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>U<sub>v</sub>(c)</b>
</td><td>Denotes the utility (a real number) to voter v of the event "candidate c wins the 
election."
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>W<sub>U,S</sub>(E)</b>
</td><td>Denotes the winner (which is a candidate in C) of the election
that would happen using
election method E, assuming that the voters employ 
voting strategy S, and that the utilities they have for
electing the candidates are described by U.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>The sum over voters &sum;<sub>v</sub></b>
</td><td>The purpose of this sum is to compute the <i>total</i> regret for all of society,
of the event "W(E) gets elected" versus the optimum possible event "c gets elected"
where c is the utility-maximizing candidate.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>The max over candidates max<sub>c</sub></b>
</td><td>Its purpose is to make sure we 
compute the regret with respect to the <i>best</i> possible winner. Note that because of
this, the sum always has <i>nonnegative</i> value, causing BR(E)&ge;0 for every
election method E.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>The integration &int;...dM(U)</b>
</td><td>The purpose of this integration is to find the <i>expected</i>
regret over the entire probability-space of all possible election scenarios, 
using the correct probability measure M.  This space is |V|&middot;|C|-dimensional
(and hence the integration really is a <i>multiple</i> integration of that dimensionality)
because location within it
is described by |V|&middot;|C| utility values, one for each voter-candidate pair.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<i>Good</i> election methods E are those with <i>small</i> regret BR(E).
</p>
<p>
It is possible by means of this formula and "Monte Carlo integration" on a computer, 
to <i>evaluate</i> (as a number) BR(E) 
for any given election method E, approximately
to any desired number of decimal places of accuracy,
provided you know |C|, |V|, S, and M and you have a fast-enough computer.
And if you do not know those things you still can try different simplified "models" for them
and see what happens &ndash; hopefully the best election methods will just be good in
a way fairly insensitive to modeling assumptions.   (That pretty much happens
with <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.)
</p><p>
This hope will not necessarily be fulfilled, but then you'll be able to see for <i>which</i> kinds
of scenarios we get large regret.  For example, if in 3-candidate elections 
with cherry-flavored dishonest/strategic voting, some election method E suffers enormous regret,
then the computer and this formula would have found that out for us, allowing E's
designer to now try to modify E to make it perform better under those circumstances.
</p><p>
The formula also (if E, M, and S are simple enough) 
can sometimes make it possible to just do the integral <i>exactly</i> using the human mind 
(not a computer).
Both these things have been done.
