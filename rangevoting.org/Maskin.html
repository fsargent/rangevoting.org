<H2> Flaws in Dasgupta and Maskin's Scientific American article </H2>

<p>
Unfortunately, Dasgupta and Maskin's article in  Scientific American
was flawed and misleading.
</p>
<blockquote>
P.Dasgupta &amp; E.Maskin: The fairest vote of all,
Scientific American 290,3 (March 2004) 92-97.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>What voting system are they talking about?</b>
First of all, Dasgupta &amp; Maskin do not actually <i>specify</i> the voting system they are 
pushing (!?!), but I believe that they meant 
<a href="Glossary.html#black">Black's system</a>, which 
dates to the 1950s or earlier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Strategic voting &ndash; ignored without a trace:</b>
Dasgupta &amp; Maskin completely ignored the massive effects of voters 
who vote "strategically" instead of honestly in an attempt to "game 
the system."  For example, in the 2000 election, approximately 
<a href="http://www.electionstudies.org">90%</a> of the voters who 
liked Nader best, instead chose to dishonestly vote (as they
were urged in hundreds of editorials) for somebody else, e.g. Gore, for strategic 
reasons ("don't waste your vote").  It is an easy theorem
that with strategic voters who employ the strategy: "determine the two 
frontrunners (based on pre-election polls); then vote one top and the other bottom,"
the winner in an N-candidate 
Black-Dasgupta-Maskin election will be the <i>same</i> as the winner 
in a plain-<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
election!  This theorem destroys Dasgupta &amp; Maskin's
claim that Black's system is "superior" to plain plurality.
This theorem also holds for the 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV system</a> (which Dasgupta &amp;
Maskin also mention but do not describe) and
is an equally severe indictment of IRV.
</p>

<p>
<b>What if voters are honest?</b>
Dasgupta &amp; Maskin also disserved us by propagating the myth that
the "true majority winner" (if one exists) always is the best.
Counterexample:  Suppose candidate Hitler, if elected,
will award 51% of the voters 1 dollar worth of societal benefit
but kill the other 49%.  Meanwhile candidate Gandhi won't kill
anybody and will award 1000 dollars to the 49%.
Everybody knows this
and everybody acts (i.e. votes) for their own benefit solely.  
While Hitler will be the "true majority winner," Gandhi is better
for society as a whole.  Range voting with honest voters
would allow the election of Gandhi in this situation, but no
other competing system would.  
</p>

<p>
<b>What about voting paradoxes and pathologies?</b>
Such as the <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p56">fact</a>
that in Black's system, casting an honest vote can cause the
election result (from your point of view) to <a href="CondPF.html">worsen</a> 
versus if you had
not voted at all?
(And in this respect, D&amp;M's Black system actually is <i>worse</i> than plurality voting,
albeit there are plenty of reasons to vote strategically even with plurality.)
D&amp;M leave that unmentioned as though it did not exist.
</p>

<p>
<b>What about <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>
as an objective yardstick of voting system quality?</b>
Dasgupta &amp; Maskin completely ignored the entire BR concept as though it never existed.
However, my 1999-2000 computerized study
(paper #56 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>, 
which included both
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>,
D&amp;M's favored Black system, and
IRV, and many other systems too as "contenders") found that
Range Voting was superior to all other systems compared there, for either "honest,"
"strategic," or "ignorant" voters (various ignorance levels) in all of 720
different probabilistic scenarios.
</p>

<p>
<b>What the devil did Dasgupta and Maskin actually accomplish, anyhow?</b>
They wrote a more formal paper titled 
<a href="assets/documents/REVISEDMajorityRule.pdf">On the Robustness of Majority Rule and Unanimity Rule</a>.
<small>
This paper still has not been published in any journal as of March 2008, i.e. 
exactly 4 years after
their Scientific American popular
article about it, but they made the 2007 revision available
electronically, and that is what you get by clicking the link.
</small>
This paper claimed to prove a new theorem, which was basically the same
as <a href="BlackSingle.html">Duncan Black's single-peakedness theorem</a>
from 1948, but made to
hold under more general conditions than Black had.  Precisely what those
new improved conditions were, was not easy to elucidate by reading D&amp;M.
</p>

<p>
<b>So what was Black's theorem, and does it matter in the real world?</b>
Black's theorem was that in "one dimensional politics" where all candidates are
located on a <i>line</i> and voter quality-ratings of those candidates are <i>single peaked</i>
(i.e. rising, then peaking, then falling) functions of location on that line,
then, with honest rank-order ballots, a "Condorcet winner" will always exist,
i.e. <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">preference cycles</a> are impossible.  That theorem's
validity is due to the fact that, if 3 candidates A,B,C
occur in that order along the 1-dimensional line, then
(in Black's model) no voter can regard B as worse than both A and C.
Here are three reasons Black's assumptions differ from reality:
<ol>
<li>
Real voters are <i>strategic</i>.  A voter may well decide
to exaggerate the badness of B, dishonestly ranking him "worst",
for strategic reasons ("don't want to waste my vote").
In other words, D&amp;M's assumption of voter honesty is wrong in real life.
</li><li>
Real voters <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> rank B as worse than both A and C.
For example, suppose the most important issue is whether
to invade and conquer an enemy country that is threatening to
kill us all by next week, or to make a peace treaty with them.  
Well, I would prefer my leader to do one or do the 
other, but definitely do it fast.  I would <i>not</i> want my leader
to take the middle course and do neither. 
More prosaically, on page 94 Dasgupta &amp; Maskin state that their singlepeakedness 
"simplifying" assumption leads them to regard it as "impossible" that a voter in
the 2000 USA presidential election could have had the preference orders
Gore>Nader>Bush>Buchanan or Gore>Nader>Buchanan>Bush.
In other words, Black's "single peakedness" assumption can just be wrong in real life.
</li><li>
Real voters are not 1-dimensional.
For example, consider the Gore-Bush-Nader 2000 election.
<ul>
<li>
Voter #1 cares about <i>honesty</i> and says that, as far as honesty
is concerned, Nader>>Gore>Bush.
</li><li>
Voter #2 cares about <i>experience</i>: number of years in high office.
So he ranks  Gore>Bush>>Nader.
</li><li>
Voter #3 cares about <i>lowering his taxes</i> and figures Nader, as a consumer
advocate, will cut taxes more (or raise them less) than Gore, so
he ranks   Bush>Nader>Gore.
The net result of these 3 voters (who note, here live in a <i>three</i>-dimensional
"issue space") is to create a preference cycle.
</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
So Black's theorem (and presumably also Dasgupta and Maskin's improved version of it)
is a perfectly 
fine theorem in a mathematical world, but in the real world, it is not necessarily
applicable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Suppose I don't buy your criticisms of D&amp;M and I like their 1-dimensional singlepeakedness assumptions just fine?  And/or I like their desire for a Condorcet winner just fine?  Then what?</b>
Then you still should probably prefer Range Voting over D&amp;M's Black-system.
Even when Range Voting takes on Dasgupta &amp; Maskin battling in a world in 
which <i>their assumptions</i> are perfectly satisfied, Range Voting wins and Black's 
system loses.
What do I mean by that?  Well, 
<ul>
<li>
in paper #95
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>, I do a computer-aided
Bayesian Regret study of precisely the 3-candidate 1-dimensional politics scenario
Dasgupta &amp; Maskin favor,
and Range Voting does better (Bayesian Regret wise) than Black voting. 
<small> Maskin nowhere cites this work by me. </small>
</li><li>
A <a href="AppCW.html">remarkably simple theorem</a> shows that range (and approval)
voting, under certain fairly realistic assumptions about voters' strategies, will
automatically elect the Condorcet Winner when one exists.  In other words, if
D&amp;M like honest-voter Condorcet Winners then (this time <i>not</i> ignoring the fact voters
can strategize) they ought to like range voting.
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>In summary</b>, while most or all of these errors and omissions
might have been excusable in a specialized
publication with limited scope, Dasgupta and Maskin chose to make big utterly-unjustified
claims in their
title (few regard Black as even one of the better Condorcet systems), 
chose to publish in an ultra-high readership magazine, and exuded an aura of
apparent scholarship and authority
due to Maskin being a professor at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study 
("president of the Econometric Society") and Dasgupta being a knighted
professor at Cambridge.   
But their article was so badly written that it did not even clearly explain the voting system they
were pushing, and was organized around two "proofs by example" (the
first-listed logically vacuous proof technique on
<a href="HowToProveIt.html">this list</a>).
All that combined, seems to me to render the above sins inexcusable.
