<p>
This 100-voter example election illustrates an old controversy between 
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
and 
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>
dating back to
the days of the French Revolution in the 1700s.
According to Condorcet, A should win.
(A also wins under the <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting method.)
But according to Borda, B should win.
Who really should win?  Good question.
</p>

<p>
Now let's see how range voting would handle this.
If the voters say
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
51
</td>
<td align="center">
A=99, B=70, C=60
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    49
</td>
<td align="center">
B=95, C=90, A=85
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<th>
Average
</th>
<td align="center">
<b>A=92.14</b>,
B=82.25,
C=74.70
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
then A wins. But if they say

</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
51
</td>
<td align="center">
A=99, B=95, C=40
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    49
</td>
<td align="center">
 B=90, C=85, A=40
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<th>
Average
</th>
<td align="center">
A=70.09,
<b>B=92.55</b>,
C=62.05
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
then B is the winner.
</p>

<p>
The point is that range voting allows voters to say <i>how much</I> they
prefer B over A (or whoever).  <i>Quantitatively</i>.
Really, Borda or Condorcet are <i>both</i> right  &ndash; but who is right depends
on intensity-of-preference information that simply is unavailable to their voting methods,
but is available to range voting.  So this example illustrates an advantage of range voting
over both of these previous voting systems.
</p>

<h3> More examples </h3>
<p>
Here's a
<a href="CondorcetCycles.html#PoundstoneCycPic">pictorial</a> example 
and another <a href="SimmonsGeomCyc.html">cleaner version</a>
(we don't need no stinking numbers, we want a <i>Picture</I>!)
</p>

<p>
Another example is in <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p30">puzzle 30</a>.
In that example, Borda and Approval voting both are clueless but range voting, thanks
to quantitative preference information in votes, can act sensibly.
And here is <a href="Goofier.html">yet another example</a> that makes the same point
perhaps even more powerfully.
</p>
<p>
<a href="UngerExp.html">
Still more examples</a> (by Professor Stephen Unger, Columbia University, NY)
this time demonstrating how <i>approval</i> voting can <i>also</i>
have more expressive power than any ranked method.
