<H2> How voting for your favorite can be a huge mistake </h2>

<p>
Consider a simplified approximate version of the 2000 US Presidential election.
Here's approximately how (poll studies showed) the voters felt.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>2000 feelings:</caption>
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> true favorite </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bush(Rep) </td>
<td> 43% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Gore(Dem) </td>
<td> 30% </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Nader </td>
<td> 27% </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
But the Nader-favorite voters, if forced to choose between Gore and Bush, favored Gore by about
an 80:20 ratio. 
It was <i>strategically stupid</i> of them to vote honestly for their <i>true favorite Nader</i>.
If they did so, as we can see, their most-hated candidate (Bush) would win easily.
If every Nader voter instead <i>refused</i> to vote for Nader, then approximately <i>this</i> 
would  have happened:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>2000 feelings (restricted to Bush &amp; Gore):</caption>
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bush(Rep) </td>
<td> 49% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Gore(Dem) </td>
<td> 51% </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
And Gore wins,
which &ndash; in the view of about 80% of the Nader voters &ndash;  was a better outcome.  
Our <a href="Plurality.html">plurality </a> voting system <i>incentivizes voters to lie.</i>
And not only that, but to lie in such a way that "third parties"
systematically are weakened and 
<a href="TPHist.html">die</a>.
</p>
<p>
So sure enough (studies showed) about 90% of the 
Nader-favorite voters <i>did</i> vote for somebody else!
(How would you feel about that if you were Nader?)
Here's how it went down (official election totals)
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>2000 official totals:</caption>
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> true favorite </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bush(Rep) </td>
<td> 47.9% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Gore(Dem) </td>
<td> 48.4% </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Nader </td>
<td> 2.7% </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> Others (combined) </td>
<td> 1.0% </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
and Bush won.  (Yes, Bush won with slightly fewer votes than Gore, thanks to
his extremely close victory in
the state of Florida and the USA's "electoral college" non-popular vote system.)
</p>

<p>
The 10% of Nader voters who voted honestly made a huge mistake by being honest,
and they paid for it.  
But <i>why</i> should honestly voting for your favorite be a mistake?  Couldn't
there be a better voting system in which it is <i>not</i> a mistake?
