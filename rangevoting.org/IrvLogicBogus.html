<H2> The logic behind IRV is flawed  </H2>

<p>
Usually when explaining IRV, advocates spend a great deal of time convincing
you that the candidate who receives the most (plurality)
votes is not necessarily the best.
Then, usually without any explanation, they assume
that the candidate with the <i>least</i> number is the <i>worst</i>.
</p>

<p>
The trick (the same kind of misdirection used by magicians):
They assume that as a former believer in plurality (and that's almost everybody)
you started with this assumption.
</p>

<p>
There's nothing wrong with eliminating candidates.  But eliminating
them based on the assumption that the lowest plurality candidate is the
worst doesn't make sense, unless you actually believe that first-preference
support is the best indicator of popularity.  But if you believe that,
you can't agree with IRV!
</p>

<p>
If you believe in IRV, then presumably you'd want to select the losers to eliminate, 
also using IRV.  But that simply will not work, because 
the IRV winner is <a href="IrvRevFail.html">entirely capable</a>
of being the same person as the IRV loser!  In other words, IRV is not self-consistent.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> is logically
self-consistent in this respect:   if you eliminate the worst (in terms
of their range-vote scores) candidates, you end up with the range voting winner.
