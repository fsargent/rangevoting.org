<p><small>(<a href="RangeVoting.html">Return to main page</a>)</small></p>

<p>
<a href="PressKenya2007.html">Press reports like these</a>
give me about 95% confidence that the 
27 December 2007 Kenya presidential
election "won" by the incumbent
Mwai Kibaki, was rigged. 
The real victor should have been opposition leader Raila Odinga.
</p>
<p>
To summarize the low points,
Odinga led comfortably
in 50 opinion polls, including 90% of all major polls during September-December 2007;
and also led in all the early election returns.  
But conveniently, the late-arriving returns 2+ days later
swung it to Kibaki despite more than half of his cabinet having been voted out
and Odinga's ODM party winning a majority in parliament.
Odinga demanded a recount but
just 3 days after the election Kibaki was sworn in.
An official of the Kenyan elections office came forward claiming it was rigged,
naming rigged districts, and claiming computers were used.
An EU observer noted how one total announced in front of him changed by 25,000 votes...
The EU's head observer, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, said "the presidential elections were flawed"
since
"the tallying process lacks credibility."
The EU called for an investigation.
</p><p>
The result was violence, riots, and chaos
(Over 1000 dead so far as of 12 February &ndash;
A BBC reporter saw 43 bodies with gunshot wounds 
in a mortuary in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, with a witness saying
police shot protesters; over 100 homes were burned in Mathare; 250,000 people
are 
<a href="PressKenya2007.html#guardianhome">estimated</a>
to have been forced from their homes
with 100,000 now at 
<a href="PressKenya2007.html#latstarve">risk</a>
of starving).
</p><p>
The government reacted by
suspending television coverage.
</p><p>
And even if by some miracle
it actually was <i>not</i> rigged
but just <i>looks</i> rigged, then all that,
please note, would have happened anyway.
Election <i>appearances</i> matter, 
sometimes at the life or death level of seriousness.
</p>
<p>
Rigged elections &ndash; or perceptions/accusations thereof &ndash; have 
<a href="LessFraud.html#fraudwar">led</a> in the
past in other countries to
civil wars and/or long periods of repression.
</p>
<h3> What if Kenya had had 
<a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">Rivest-Smith Antifraud Voting Protocols</a>?
</h3>
<p>
With Rivest-Smith, we get 
<ol type="a">
<li>
Essentially total confidence the election was not rigged (<i>if</i> it 
wasn't rigged).  
</li><li>
But if it was rigged, then we get either
<ol type="1">
<li>
Essentially total confidence it was rigged 
(and a decent estimate of how much rigging there was and in what direction; plus
ways to try to track down "whodunit" and "wheredunit");
</li>
<li>
Or it will be obvious to observers
at the polling places that they are not following the protocols.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In case (a), Kenya would be saved  from all the suspicion, riots, possible civil war, etc.
In case (b), international alliances of countries would be in a position to denounce
Kenya and/or to try to impose penalties.
(As opposed to the USA's unwise
move, which was  immediately to congratulate Kibaki on his "victory" and call for the
result to be "respected."
<small>
"The United States congratulates the winners and is calling for calm, and for 
Kenyans to abide by the results declared by the election commission. 
We support the commission's decision [to elect Kibaki]," said 
[US State Dept.] spokesman Robert McInturff.
But the USA later <a href="PressKenya2007.html#usq">questioned anomalies</a>
and <a href="PressKenya2007.html#backped">backpedaled</a>.</small>)
</p>
<p>
The main <b>price</b> you have to pay for Rivest-Smith, 
is	it's slightly more complicated for voters to vote,
although for Luddite voters there could be a "use old-style voting" option which <i>still</i> could
be made secure thanks to the remarkable
"contagious protection 'easy upgrade' property"
of Rivest-Smith (in which the secure new-style ballots "contagiously protect" the
old-style insecure ballots).
</p>
<h3> Are Rivest-Smith's benefits worth the price? </h3>
<p>
Let's do a numerical calculation.  I'm (re)writing this on 15 January 2008
(2 weeks after the election) and so far at least 600 Kenyans have been killed in
election-related violence and rising.  
Probably a lot more will die.
If they have a civil war and/or
enhanced repression/anti-democracy measures, you can bet on it. 
Plus there are now (as of 6 January) press reports that 250,000 have been made homeless and 100,000
are going to be at risk of starving.
I'm going to consider that to be equivalent to at least 1500 more deaths.
So
</p>
<center>
<b>Benefit of having Rivest-Smith</b> &ge; 2100 lives saved.  <br>
(But only 1000 lives saved if the victims 
are reckoned to have lost 47% of a life on average.)
</center>
<p>
But suppose, in order to use Rivest-Smith, voters have to think more
and work harder when voting, and/or waste time
being educated on how to use the new protocol.  
Suppose that extra effort is <b>N minutes</b> per voter.
There were 9 million voters. That is 9N million minutes of voter-time lost, which
figuring the 2007 life expectancy of Kenyans is 55 years, is
0.311&times;N lives worth of time, lost.
</p>
<center>
<b>Cost of having Rivest-Smith</b> &asymp; 0.311&times;N lives worth of time lost.
</center>
<p>
So the benefit of adopting Rivest-Smith in Kenya outweighs the cost provided
<center>
N&lt;6751 <br> (or in the view that the victims only lost 46% of a life,
if N&lt;3106)
</center>
<p>
There is no way  voters will need anywhere <i>near</i> as much as  3106
minutes worth of extra education and/or thinking to figure out
Rivest-Smith.    The truth is somewhere between 1 minute and a few hours per voter, probably a lot
closer to the former.
(Plus, even if it did take that long, then not
all that time
should be reckoned as "wasted" 
since learning how Rivest-Smith voting
works is a useful educational experience
with side-benefits.)
Also,
unfortunately, it is realistic to think the death toll is going to keep <b>rising</b>...
[in fact as of later on 31 December 2007
and AFP <a href="PressKenya2007.html#afp185">now</a>
reports at least 185 deaths... rising from 149 reported earlier... later,
as of 1 Jan 2008, press reports say "at least 200" deaths and
some may be starting to claim 250... as of 2 Jan
<a href=PressKenya2007.html#ap300">AP</a>
claims 300 dead... latest AP News claim on 15 Jan is 600 dead...
as of 12 February it is claimed "over 1000" have died...
Both BBC and 
AP news reported on
11 February: "UN humanitarian chief John Holmes said Monday that up to 600,000 
people have been displaced in the violence.
'There are something like 300,000 people displaced in camps,' Holmes told reporters in 
Helsinki after [visiting] Kenya.
'Beyond those 300,000 there are probably just as many who are not in camps who...
are sheltering with friends and neighbours somewhere else'."]
</p><p>
<font color="red"><b>So Rivest-Smith is clearly worth it.</b></font>
</p>
<h3> Attacks on (and defenses of) this conclusion </h3>
<p>
One could argue that only <i>waking</i> hours of your life count.
We don't necessarily agree with that, but if so, the magic
N estimate needs to be reduced by about 33%.
</p>
<p>
One also could complain that we have not reckoned the money (=time) required
to equip Kenya with Rivest-Smith voting-machines and technology.
(Which, by the way, do not yet exist.)
That objection is serious because in the 2007 USA, equipping populations with voting machines
costs about $8 per person.  With Kenya's 2007 population of 37 million, that would
add up to $261 million, which is equivalent to 261 lives if a life is
worth $1 million.  
<small>
And while $1 million might be in the right ballpark for a 2007 US life,
one could argue Kenyan lives are worth a lot less than $1 million.  
Cold hard reality is that Kenya's 2007 GDP in PPP$ per year 
is equivalent to about $1300 per citizen,
i.e. only about $72,000 per life. 
At that price, this money is equivalent to 3625 Kenyan lives.
</small>
Also it would take additional money to train election workers.
Since "only" 600 people have died as of 2 January (AP),
Rivest-Smith might not be worth that cost.  
</p><p>
A <b>reply</b> to these critics is that Kenya would
have to spend this kind of money <i>anyway</i> over time for
whatever other voting machines
and election worker training it is going to have. 
Therefore this "cost" (or a large portion of it) isn't real.
Plus, the rioting etc has <i>already</i> probably cost the average Kenyan around $8 worth of
some kind of cost (time, hassle, precautions... the entirety of usually-traffic-choked 
Nairobi was shut down except for soldiers, and Kenya's $billion/year 
<a href="PressKenya2007.html#tourismtoast">tourism</a>
industry is likely to lose over $261 million just this next year alone since who's going to
go there? [Reuters: "Bewildered tourists were stranded by delayed flights
at Mombasa airport on the Indian Ocean coast..." News.com.au: "Avoid Kenya, travellers told."
And from <tt>canada.com</tt>:
"[Kenyan] business leaders said this weekend's tribal clashes were costing more than $30 
million a day in lost <i>taxes</i> &ndash; not to mention looting damage &ndash;
and threatened investment in Kenya."].
Plus, it unfortunately is not likely the death-toll is going to stop at only 600,
and deaths from protesters and rioters are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg of
the price Kenya pays if it has a fraudulent democracy.
</p>

<!-- Ohio Pickaway County $500K for new voting machines. Population 52727.
CT. $24M for new voting machines opscan, entire st brought up to HAVA stds. Population 3,405,565.
Kenya population=37M (2007).  So estimate $261M. At $1M/life that is 261 lives. -->

<p>
<b>Bottom line:</b> 
although these critic-attacks may have a point, 
I (Smith) now believe that the costs to Kenya of all this have now risen to such a
absurdly huge degree, that that, combined with our defenses to the critics's attacks, 
is sufficient to 
cost-justify Rivest-Smith no matter how you reckon it.

<h3> Update (Kenya, March 2013) </h3>
<p>
Although Odinga lost the 2007 presidential election, 
he took office as Prime Minister in April 2008
(following the violent post-electoral crisis)
serving as supervisor of a national unity coalition government.
That violence has been estimated to have killed at least 1300 and displaced 600K.
The widely-blamed Electoral Commission of Kenya was disbanded and replaced by
an "Interim Independent Electoral Commission" (IIEC) on 7 May 2009,
then changed to the
"Independent Electoral &amp; Boundaries Commission" (IEBC) in 2011 by act of
parliament.
Then in 2013, the two top contenders for the presidency were
Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta.  Kenyatta was the son of former ruler Jomo Kenyatta
and one of the richest men in Africa, but 
both Kenyatta and his running mate William Ruto are due
to  be tried by the
International Criminal Court
for "crimes against humanity" for allegedly bankrolling gangs to exact "tribal revenge" 
(those gangs killed at least 40) during the 2007-8 crisis.
The court announced that the 
start of Kenyatta's trial would be delayed from April until July 2013.
</p><p>
<b>Election Result:</b> On 9 March, Kenyatta was officially declared victor with 50.03% of the vote
(provisional) then 50.07% (final announcement).
That 0.03% or 0.07% was crucial since without it he'd be forced into a second
runoff election versus Odinga.
Unfortunately I have major doubts that any country, including Kenya, is capable of counting
votes with this degree of accuracy even if we had no worries whatever about fraud.  
This 0.07% is about 7000 votes, and
the difference between the provisional and final tallies thus was about 4000, indicating
a "noise level" of at least 4000 in the winning margin.
</p><p>
<b>Contrast:</b>
In the <a href="Flor2000Res.html"><b>Florida 2000</b></a> USA presidential election,
a media consortium including
the New York Times, Wall Street Journal,  Tribune Company,  Washington Post, 
Associated Press,  St. Petersburg Times,  Palm Beach Post and CNN
hired the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago in January 2001
to examine the 6 million ballots (using three coders per ballot to avoid possible coder mistakes).
The resulting database of all Florida ballots gave different totals depending on what 
precise definition of
"a valid ballot" was employed, e.g. "detached chads," dimples, 
chad hanging by 1 corner, 2 corners, what sort of scribbles were regarded as valid votes 
or not, how to handle "overvotes" of different kinds, including the kind where somebody votes 
"Gore" <i>and</i> writes in the name "Gore," whether two or all three of the coders had to agree
about a ballot, etc.  
Using the most restrictive standard &ndash; fully punched ballot &ndash;
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011217183836/http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp">NORC</a> 
found that 5252 more votes would/should have been added to Florida's 5.96 million,
and that the new total would have elected Gore by 115 votes, not Bush by 
537.  (The state of Florida was counted using non-uniform standards and never
officially recounted, hence Bush officially won by 537.  
Gore tried by court challenges to force a <i>partial</i>
recount, i.e. in some but not all counties.
Gore lost the case in the US supreme court; if Gore had won it, it appears 
he still would have lost the election by 225 votes because he foolishly did not ask to recount 
the <i>whole</i>  state of Florida.)  Other standards would have produced
other results, although with most combinations of choices, Gore won.  NORC 
made available an interactive online tool where you could input your favorite combination of 
definitions of "votes you'd accept," and it would tell you the election result under that
definition-combination.)
My lesson from this very heavy and expensive study
is that the "noise level" in Florida 2000 was about &plusmn;5000 votes
as far as counting the total number of ballots was concerned, and about &plusmn;200
as far as the Bush-Gore margin was concerned (using uniform statewide standards)
and much larger, say 1000, with the nonuniform biased-toward-Bush standards they actually used.
And that is just the tip of the iceberg &ndash; if we further tried to investigate 
which voters were and were not really permitted to vote 
(since, e.g, felons, fraudulent addresses, falsely accused of being felons, etc)
then far more "noise" would have been introduced...  
</p><p>
<b>Returning to Kenya</b>,
The <i>Associated press</i>, Nairobi, Thursday 7 March 2013, reported:
</p><blockquote>
The political coalition led by Kenya's PM Raila Odinga, 
said on Thursday that the vote-tallying process now under way to determine 
the winner of the country's presidential election "lacks integrity" and 
should be stopped, and alleged that some vote results had been doctored.
</blockquote><p>
Odinga  claimed there were several districts where the number of votes cast exceeded
the number of registered voters.  Also the spoiled ballot count was claimed wrong by a 
factor of 8 due
to "software bug," and Kenya's "secure vote-results communications system" malfunctioned.
This <a href="Kenya2013flaws.html">report</a> by Peter Greste discusses the situation.
