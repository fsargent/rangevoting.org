<H1> A nation of hypocrites  </H1>

<h2>  NSA surveillance </h2>

<p>
The USA's 2-party domination, <a href="Duverger.html">caused</a> by its diseased 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system,
has distorted its politics to the point where, for a large fraction of
the country, it doesn't matter how good or bad some policy objectively is &ndash;
the only thing that matters is
which side proposed it.
</p><p>
Want proof?  Consider this complete reversal of opinions about NSA
surveillance programs.  When President G.W.Bush (R) was in charge, Republicans loved
his secret unconstitutional NSA surveillance programs while Democrats hated them.
Wait 7 years.
Now Obama (D) is president and (leaks revealed) considerably expanded Bush's
spying operations, completely contrary to his campaign promises.
Obama's NSA tracked
far more secretly-acquired information about every citizen than secret-police like
East Germany's Stasi ever dreamed of...
and voila:  suddenly Republican support for these programs has greatly declined
to nearly 50-50,
while the Democratic pollees developed a great love
for our Brave New World.
</p><p>
Amazing, isn't it?

<h2> Another example: Government health care plan </h2>

<p>
In February 1971 and again in <a href="NixonHealthPlan.html">Feb. 1974</a>
President Richard Nixon (R)
proposed a health insurance reform plan.
It was based around private insurance companies,
and entailed an employer mandate
to provide private health insurance,
plus federalization of Medicaid for the 
poor with dependent minor children.
The 1974 revision suggested state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based
premiums and cost sharing.
Nixon's plan did not include an "individual mandate," i.e. did not
require all Americans to purchase health insurance.
</p><p>
<b>Result:</b>
Hearings on national health insurance were held by the House Ways and Means Committee 
and the Senate Finance Committee in 1971, but committee 
chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills (D-AR) and Sen. Russell Long (D-LA)
blocked the bill from reaching the floor.
In 1974, the bill acquired some Democratic sponsors, but
the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers lobbied successfully to kill the plan.
</p><p>
Now skip forward 35 years to 2009-2010.
Lo and behold, Pres. Obama (D) spearheaded a drive for a very similar health plan
(but now including an individual mandate, and dropping the state-run plans,
contrary to Obama's campaign promises).
And golly gee. Now the AFL-CIO and UAW and Democrats <i>supported</i> the plan,
while it was the Republicans who opposed and almost killed it.
</p><p>
The only difference that mattered:  the <i>names</i> Obama and Nixon.
