<H2> Oversimplification of why IRV leads to 2-party domination </H2>

<p>
Based on my polling experiences, I can virtually guarantee
you that a big percentage of IRV voters are going to rank Bush top and
Kerry bottom, or vice versa, even though neither is their honest opinion.
</p>

<p>
You can fantasize all you want about how that isn't necessarily always strategically
best, or they wouldn't have been smart enough to think of that, or whatever.
<b>Reality</b> is, they'll do it.
</P>

<p>
Now assuming this happens, it is goodbye to all third parties:
under the rules of the IRV system, none can win, so game over.
</p>

<p>
(What if the same thing happens under range voting?  No problem, under those circumstances
a third party can still win easily under the rules of range voting.)
</p>

<p>
It's that simple.  So if you are a third party, we hope you are listening.
