<p><b>Puzzle #3 (interesting &ndash; easy once you see it, otherwise hard!):</b><br><small><font color="red">[4]</font></small>
Three people enter a room and a red or blue mark is made on each person's forehead. 
The color of each mark is determined by a coin toss, with the outcome of one coin 
toss having no effect on the others. Each person can see the others' marks but not his own.
<br>
<i>No communication of any sort is allowed</i>, 
except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. 
Once they have had a chance to look at the other marks,
they must (simultaneously) guess the color of their own marks, or pass. 
The group shares a hypothetical $3 million prize if at least one player guesses 
correctly and none guess incorrectly.
<br>
The problem is to find a 
strategy for the group maximizing its chances of winning the prize.
<br>
For example, one obvious strategy for the players would be for one player always to guess 
"red" while the others pass. That would give the group a 50% chance of winning 
the prize.  Can the group do better?

<p><b>Puzzle #5 (<strike>open</strike> now solved! &ndash; voting systems obeying both ICC and AFB):</b><br><small><font color="red">[7]</font></small>
Two desirable properties of a voting system &ndash; both of which Range Voting has &ndash;
are "immunity to candidate-cloning" (ICC) and "avoiding favorite betrayal" (AFB).
<br>
AFB: voters should never have strategic incentive to "betray" their favorite 
candidate by voting him below some other.
<br>
ICC: political parties should be unable to usefully manipulate an election
by running clones of their own, or of an opposed, candidate; voters here are assumed
to vote honestly and to have only tiny preferences (which they may express in their
votes, if they exist) among the clones.
<br>
In contrast: the USA's present "plurality" voting system fails both tests:
It was strategically unwise in Florida in 2000 to vote for Nader even if he was your favorite;
and by sponsoring extra "clones" of your top opponent, that can cause their vote
to be split and hence cause both clones to lose, and you to win.
<br>
<b>Question:</b>
Is range voting (and obvious variants of it) the <i>only</i> nontrivial single-winner
voting system to satisfy both properties?
(A "voting system" inputs a set of votes and [deterministically] outputs the name of a winner.
The votes are numerical scores for some-or-all candidates, or rank-orderings of
some-or-all candidates, optionally with ranking-equalities permitted.)
<br>
Note: Many voting systems are known (beyond just variants of range voting) which
<a href="FBCsurvey.html">satisfy AFB</a>, and many also are known 
(such as 
<a href="SchulzeExplan.html">Schulze<a/>
<a href="SchulzeComplic.html">beatpaths</a>,
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>,
[but not <a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>!],
Woodall-DAC, and Heitzig River)
that satisfy ICC.
But I do not know of any systems besides range voting variants
which satisfy both simultaneously.  
<br>
<b>Partial credit:</b> Must any such system employ continuum votes?
What if the problem is restricted to systems based on pure-rank-order ballots
(with candidate-equalities forbidden)?

Suppose there are 4 dice: Blue, Green, Red, and White.
These dice have different numbers than usual printed on their six faces.
After observing a long sequence of experiments rolling pairs of these dice,
you conclude that
<ul>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the blue die gives a higher number than the green die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the green die gives a higher number than the red die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the red die gives a higher number than the white die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
</ul>
You are now asked to consider rolling the blue and white dice simultaneously.
What can you conclude about the probability P that the blue die will
produce a higher value than the white one?  (Is P>50%?)

Puzzle #8: Probabilities of Favorite-Betrayal Lesser-Evil scenarios with
Condorcet voting in 3-candidate elections with equal rankings permitted:
</b><br><small><font color="red">[6]</font></small>
Again suppose there are V voters and all 12<sup>V</sup> elections
are equally likely.
We shall only be interested in the V&rarr;&infin; limit.
Suppose the election proceeds as follows.
If a candidate exists who pairwise-beats (or at least ties)
every other, then he is the winner.  (And we disallow elections with more than one winner.)
Otherwise, the candidate X,  suffering at most one
pairwise defeat and with that defeat being the "weakest,"
wins.
</p>
<p>
There are two possible ways to define that Y>X is the "weakest defeat":
<ol type="a">
<li>
"Margins":
the difference between the number of Y>X voters and X>Y voters is minimal.
</li>
<li>
"Winning votes":
There are the fewest voters ranking Y>X in the defeat of X by Y
(we <i>ignore</i> the number of X>Y and X=Y voters, so long as this <i>is</i>
a defeat, i.e. the number of Y>X voters exceed the number of X>Y voters).
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
In either system: <i>what is the probability</i> that this election will include a
"Favorite-Betrayal Lesser-Evil (FBLE) scenario" in which, say, A wins,
but some "C-top and B>A" voters by dishonestly rating their favorite C <i>below</i> top,
can cause the "lesser evil" B to win instead of A (a result they prefer)?
Note: It only counts as FBLE if those voters can <i>only</i> achieve their
B-wins goal by demoting C <i>below</i> top.

Puzzle #9 (<strike>open</strike> now solved! &ndash; voting systems in which semi-honest voting is strategic):
</b><br><small><font color="red">[7]</font></small>
Let a "voting system" mean a map from a set of votes (each a rank-ordering of the candidates
with equality-rankings permitted, or an assignment of a real number score in [0,1] to
each candidate) to the identity of a single "winner" candidate.
</p>
<p>
Call a voter's vote X "semi-honest" if it, while perhaps differing from his honest opinion,
has the same rank-ordering
as a <i>limit</i> of a sequence of score-assignments that agree in their ordering
with the honest one.
For example, if the voter honestly feels <i>A>B=C>D>E</i>, then a vote A=B=C>D=E
would be semi-honest, a vote A>B=C>D>E would be honest and hence automatically semi-honest, 
but both B>A and B>C would be dishonest statements that are not even semi-honest.
</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>
Does there exist a nontrivial voting system for 4-candidate
elections in which semi-honest voting is always strategically optimal?
(Range voting has this property for elections with &le;3 candidates.)

A well known way to cut a cake into two pieces that assures 
that each person gets at least half of
the value of the cake (where the two players may value 
different cake-parts differently, e.g.
one likes chocolate and another likes cherries) is the "cut and choose" protocol
where player A cuts the cake and then player B chooses his piece.
</p>

In the previous problem
completely arbitrary styles of cake-cutting were permitted,

Puzzle #13 (range-voting with outlier-discarding):
</b><br><small><font color="red">[2]</font></small>
Suppose each voter's "vote" is an integer
numerical score from 0 to 99 for each candidate, for example a legal vote
in a 4-candidate election might be (99, 54, 0, 99).
Suppose the "final score" for a candidate is the average of all his scores that remain
after you discard the top X% and the bottom X% of them. 
<small>
If X=50, this
is just the <i>median score</i>, and if X=0 then this is just the usual kind
of range voting. These are both important special cases.  But more generally
any fixed X with 0&le;X&le;50 can be considered.
</small>
One of the advantages of ordinary range voting, which appears to be sacrificed in this
more general kind of voting, is the fact that with range voting only a <i>small</i>
amount of information may be sent by each precinct to central tabulating, <i>summarizing</i>
all the ballots (no matter how many) in that precinct.  The entire set of
ballots need not be sent.
<ol type="a">
<li>
Show that this "appearance" is delusory &ndash; this more general kind of range voting
<i>still</i> has the small-amount-of-info-summary-can-be-sent property allowing
precincts to do their own "subtotals."
</li>
<li>
Why is this more-general kind of range voting (with X&gt;0)
far less democratic than ordinary range voting (with X=0)?
</li>
<li>
What bad phenomenon would often happen in practice if median-range-voting
(the X=50 special case) were adopted?  Hint: consider the

Puzzle #14 (mostly open &ndash; Social science/economics research. Suggested by Aaron Krowne):
</b><br><small><font color="red">[9]</font></small>
Compare macro-economic
metrics, including soft ones like "economic freedom" (a number of indexes for
this exist).   One might hypothesize that countries with "better voting
systems" will progress "forward" in these various metrics faster than countries
with worse voting systems.
There may already be enough historical data in the 20-50
most recent years past to reveal some 
interesting economic-political correlations.
<small>
Colloquially, this seems to be happening.  Median incomes in the US 
[which has one of the worst voting systems]
continue to fall (since the 70s), the Gini index is rising, class
mobility is falling, the prison population is rising (and accelerating),
the black market sector is growing, and economic freedom is falling.
Meanwhile Ireland and Switzerland [with two of the best, in my opinion,
governmental setups] have impressive economies.  (2010: Oops! &ndash; Ireland's
banks just blew sky high due to massive risk taking and speculation, then
the government bailed them out sending the ountry into huge debt over 10&times;GDP,
but Ireland was supposedly a great success when we wrote this, i.e. before that happened...)

Puzzle #15 (<strike>open</strike> now solved! &ndash; multiwinner EP &amp; PR voting systems):
</b><br><small><font color="red">[7]</font></small>
The goal of a "multiwinner voting system" is to, from the "votes,"
determine W winners from C 
candidates where 0&lt;W&lt;C.
The system is "proportional" (PR) <i>if</i>, 
supposing the voters and candidates each are colored one of
a finite number of colors (i.e. voter Joe is "green," candidate Mary is "black"), and
supposing each voter prefers each candidate of his own color above all others
(and says so in her vote), <i>then</i> the winning slate of candidates will
have the same color composition as the voters (up to unavoidable integer-roundoff effects
and limitations caused by perhaps too few candidates existing of some color).
<small>For example, the famous Hare/Droop-STV system [single transferable vote with 
"Droop quotas" and "reweighting"] invented by Hare and Droop in 1800s England,
is PR.  That is, if there are 60% red, 30% black, and 10% white voters,
then we will automatically get 6,3, and 1 red, black, and white winners respectively in
a Hare/Droop-STV
election with W=10 assuming enough candidates of each color are available.</small>
The voting system is required to depend upon the votes <i>only</i>, hence
does <i>not</i> know
the candidate- or voter-colors.  
"Votes" are either preference orderings or numerical scores
(and perhaps other things would also be permissible &ndash; if you can solve this we 
are willing to be generous with the conditions).
The system is "efficiently parallelizable" (EP) if an election with an enormous number
of voters can be handled by efficient combination of subresults computed
in each election district from only the votes in that district, and these subresults
consist of a very small amount of data compared 
to the large number of votes that they summarize.  For EP to hold, 
we require all this data
to be transmitted <i>unidirectionally</i>, i.e. 
voters&rarr;district-agency&rarr;central-agency.
<small>For example the plurality system is EP because each district can simply compute
its total vote counts for each candidate, then pass only these subtotals on to the
central election agency.</small>

Does there exist a nontrivial multiwinner voting system which is both

Puzzle #36: Additive utilities:
</b><br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
A common model in social choice theory is one in which
each human has a "utility" (real number) for each possible event,
and it is deemed "best" to alter events in order
to maximize the sum (over all humans) of the utility.
In this and the next few puzzles we explore the foundations and limits of that picture. <br>
<b>(a)</b>
If the quantity to be maximized is not &sum;<sub>n</sub> U<sub>n</sub>
but rather
g(&sum;<sub>n</sub> f(U<sub>n</sub>))
where f and g are some 1-to-1 smooth functions,
then argue that this is really just the same thing
as the original additive-utility picture.  (This is just
"utilities in disguise" where f and g are the "disguising functions.")
<br>
<b>(b)</b>
Recognize that many common symmetric
functions in mathematics are just addition in disguise.
In particular, do this for the <i>product</i> function &prod;<sub>n</sub> U<sub>n</sub>,
the <i>L<sub>p</sub>-norm</i> functions
(&sum;<sub>n</sub> U<sub>n</sub><sup>p</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup> with p&gt;0,
and (in a limit sense) the <i>max</i> and <i>min</i> functions.
<br>
<b>(c)</b>
But not every smooth continuous function invariant under permutations of its N arguments,
and monotonic in each, is just addition in disguise.  When N=3 prove that the 
"combined addition and multiplication" function abc+a+b+c is not
just addition in disguise.
<br>
<b>(d)</b>
But when N=2 it is: prove that ab+a+b <i>is</i> just addition in disguise. <br>
<b>(c')</b>
An example of a 2-person combining function which is not
just addition in disguise is
ab+a<sup>b</sup>.
<br>
<b>(e)</b>
It seems reasonable to demand that any method of combining N real utilities to get 
a single real "social utility"  must 
<ol>
<li>
be symmetric, i.e. invariant under permutations
of its N arguments,
</li><li>
be smooth and monotonic-increasing in each argument alone,
</li><li>
feature "zero," that is, there exists a "don't give a damn" utility value Z such that
combining U with Z always yields U.
</li><li>
feature "inverses," i.e. for each individual utility U, there exists a 
"negated" utility V such that combining U with V yields a constant value,
and in particular, the value Z.
</li><li>
be "self consistent," that is, if you combine a,b,c,d,  then you ought
to get the same result as combining in pairs such as (a,b) and (c,d)
and then combining the resulting two values.
</li>
</ol>
where I have ordered these demands in decreasing order of subjective 
reasonableness.  Prove that these demands <i>force</i> the utility-combining
function to be 
the same thing as real-number addition (or one of its disguises). <br>

Prove that the following three axioms force

<b>
Axiom 1. [invariance under voter reordering]</b>
Social utility does not depend in which order the voters are
permuted.<br>
<b>
Axiom 2. [utility-order-invariance under adding a constant]</b>
After you add an arbitrary constant C to every utility of some particular voter,
then if A was a "better" candidate than B (higher
social utility) then it still is.<br>
<b>
Axiom 3. [non-silly]</b>
With random real number input (i.e. each individual utility independently sampled from
some probability density), there will (at least with some
positive probability) exist some unique candidate yielding maximum social utility,
i.e. the social utility does not
merely always say all candidates are equal; and the social utility exists
for generic real number input (personal utilities)
at least within some neighborhood
of the vector with all entries C (for some constant C).

Puzzle #39: Utility=Log(Wealth)?
</b><br><small><font color="red">[4]</font></small>
Claude Elwood Shannon (and much earlier, Daniel Bernoulli)
had the idea that "utility" and "money" were approximately 
related by the formula utility=log(wealth).
Let's explore that.
<br>
<b>(a)</b>
Show that this formula is consistent with the idea that doubling your wealth causes the same
increase in happiness, regardless of your initial wealth.<br>
<b>(b)</b>
Suppose you are offered the opportunity to participate in this wager:
if event E happens, each dollar you bet is replaced by R&gt;1 dollars;
but if E does not happen, you lose all the money you bet.
The probability of E is (you believe) P.
How much money should you bet, in order to maximize your expected Shannon-utility?<br>
<b>(c)</b>
Show that, under the Shannon formula, or indeed any formula of the form
utility=ConcaveDownFunction(wealth),  removing some money from a random person and giving it
to another random other person, decreases the expected sum of utilities, i.e. "random theft is
socially bad."  [Similarly, making any fair monetary bet causes negative expected utility gain,
i.e. such a utility function is "risk averse."]
Also, transferring money from poorer to richer people is socially bad,
but transferring money from richer to poorer people (provided the rich one stays richer)
is socially good.<br>
<b>(d)</b>
Criticize the Shannon formula.<br>
<b>(e)</b>
How could you try to do a better job than Shannon?
Try to devise a formula that smoothly handles <i>negative</i> wealth (i.e. debt).
What about wagers involving risk of death?  How should a bettor optimally handle them?

Puzzle #41: Invisibly Corrupted Computer Programs.

Explain how it is possible for 
an operating system such as LINUX
to be corrupted (so that, e.g, "Mortimer Snerd" can always log in)
in such a way that scrutinizing the full source code for LINUX will fail
to uncover anything special about Mortimer Snerd &ndash; even if the scrutinizer is
amazingly incredibly wise and intelligent.
(Thus, inspecting the source code of a program is inadequate for security purposes.)
Hint: LINUX is written in the C language, and the gcc C-compiler is also written in C
and is part of LINUX.

Define a V-voter C-candidate election scenario to be a "participation failure"

Let N be a number of the form  N=2<sup>p</sup>q  with q odd.

&lceil;q/2&rceil; red versus &lfloor;q/2&rfloor; blue,
i.e. so that <i>every district is majority-red</i>.
(May be necessary to cut through towns
so that a district contains, e.g, half a town, but the total number of towns, counting
fractional parts fractionally, is always exactly 
q per district and always it is an exact 
&lceil;q/2&rceil;:&lfloor;q/2&rfloor;
red:blue ratio in each.)

that for <i>any</i> odd s&ge;3, <i>any</i> (<i>s</i>+1)&times;<i>s</i>

<p><b> Puzzle #61: Voting system "stability" (S.J.Brams)
</b>
<br><small><font color="red">[4]</font></small>
An election outcome is "stable" if it is achieved by <i>some</i> set of (honest) votes
such that no voters of any single type have an incentive to change their votes.
Further, it is "strongly stable" if no subset of colluding (perhaps un-alike)
voters have incentive
to change their votes.
Otherwise it is "unstable."
(Here "election outcomes" are allowed to be "lotteries.")
When considering <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> it is of
interest to restrict attention to "semi-honest" votes, i.e. in which each voter
genuinely prefers all her approved candidates over all her disapproved ones
(and we forbid all-approved or all-disapproved "null votes").
<ol type="a">
<li>
For semi-honest approval voting, prove that an election winner is strongly stable
if and only if it is a unique Condorcet ("beats-all") winner.
</li>
<li>
Prove that it is impossible for any Condorcet voting system always to elect a
stable winner &ndash; <i>even</i> if we only demand such stability in cases where the winner
is a "beats-all" winner.
(So in this sense, <b>Condorcet systems are actually worse at electing Condorcet winners
than approval voting</b>, despite the fact that approval voting is not a Condorcet
voting system!)
</li>
<li>
Prove that it is impossible with <i>any</i>  deterministic voting system
based on rank-order ballots
(except for a "dictatorship"; and we shall assume the system always elects candidates
who are unanimously top-ranked) always to elect a stable winner.
</li>
<li>
Prove that approval voting does not always elect a stable winner.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Comment:</b>
The idea here is the approval-votes fluctuate with
time in response to opinion polls, random noise,
and voter re-strategizing &ndash; but stay semi-honest.
Once the votes reach a
"stable" configuration, they stop fluctuating
because from then on nobody has incentive to change
and repeated opinion polls delivering the
same answer eliminate the random noise.

<p><b> Puzzle #79: Biased purging in Ohio 2004
</b>
<br><small><font color="red">[3]</font></small>
Between 2000 and 2004 
(before the November 2004 Bush vs. Kerry US presidential election)
"purging" of lists of registered voters was carried out by
various Ohio counties.  
Consider a county to have been "purged" if the number of registered voters 
dropped at least 6.5% in this period.
<small>
(Note this definition is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, e.g.
some counties might consider themselves to have "purged" even if
their number of registered voters <i>increased</i> from 2000-2004.
For the purposes of this puzzle
we are making an "effective" definition of purging based on <i>results</i>,
not a definition based on <i>alleged intentions</i>.)
</small>
</p>
<pre>
The 16 Kerry-Won Counties:      The 72 Bush-Won Counties:
4 purges                        0 purges
(Athens, Belmont,
Jefferson, Monroe)

[Source: www.feminist.org   Ohio registered voter dataset]
</pre>
<p>
Assume that the probability that a county performed a purge
was unaffected by whether they were a Bush- or Kerry-county.
What is the probability that this large an anti-Kerry bias arose by luck?

<p><b> Puzzle #81: Hierarchical government
</b>
<br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
<b>A.</b>
Suppose there are N people in a country.
They wish to elect <i>n</i> congressmen (1&le;n&lt;&lt;N).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Straightforward way:</b></dt>
<dd> 
The people are divided at <i>random</i> into n disjoint subsets of cardinality N/n each.
Each district then elects one congressman in a single-winner election.
</dd>
<dt><b>Hierarchical way:</b></dt>
<dd> 
The people are divided at <i>random</i> into N/3 disjoint subsets of cardinality 3 each.
Each triple selects one of its members to promote to "the next level."
We now proceed recursively using the N/3 next-level people only, etc, each level
reducing the number of people by a factor of 3, until only n people remain.
(Assume N/n is an exact power of 3 to avoid hassles.  In the present-day USA,
N/n&asymp;3<sup>12</sup>&asymp;10<sup>6</sup>.)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Suppose the people are of two types "black" and "white."  All are
total racists, i.e. only vote for members of their own race.
Analyse how a small racial imbalance in the population (say 0.000001 away from
perfect balance)
is magnified in the congress.
</p>
<p>
<b>B.</b>
The above could be criticized as a naive, unrealistic model.  Here is another.  Assume
the blacks, though in the minority, try to dominate the government.
They gerrymander the districts so each is either all-white or has a slight
black majority.  They also manipulate the triples in the hierarchical scheme so
that each triple is either 2 blacks versus 1 white, or 3 whites.
How well do these government-takeover plans work?
</p>
<p>
<b>C.</b>
Suppose the whites "fight back" in the hierarchical scheme by making
<i>all</i> triples be 2:1 or 1:2 (if this is possible).  Then what?
</p>
<p>
<b>D.</b>
Finally suppose our blacks and whites are so racist 
they cannot stand being in the same triple.
I.e. all triples are now totally segregated 3:0 or 0:3.  Then what?

<p><b> Puzzle #82: Proxies and cycles
</b>
<br><small><font color="red">[7]</font></small>
Imagine a government set up as follows.  Each voter can either vote on a decision,
or grant her vote to somebody else that she chooses (her "proxy").  That proxy would then have
two votes, or if she were the proxy of two people, would have three, et cetera.
</p><p>
But difficulties arise if a chain of voter-to-proxy arrows is ultimately
<i>cyclic</i>.
In that case everybody in the cycle "passes the buck" and nobody actually votes.
The goal of this puzzle is to model this.
</p><p>
Suppose there are N voters in all (N large) and everybody chooses their proxy 
uniformly independently at random from among the other N-1 voters.  For each voter
the probability that they vote is P and the probability they "pass the buck" is Q=1-P.
Then what is the number of voters we expect to be disenfranchised
because their vote is transferred into a "buck-passing cycle"?

<p><b> Puzzle #83: Zero-info honesty

<br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
The <i>Zero-Info Honesty criterion</i> (ZIH) for a voting method
states:
"If all the other voters vote randomly independently (all votes equally likely) 
then it should be strategically optimal for you to cast an honest vote."
</p>
<p>
Here "honest" means "rank in honest order of preference" (for a rank-order voting method)
but means "rank with favorite=max, most-hated=min, and other linearly interpolated according
to your utilities for their election" for range voting.
</p>
<b>A.</b>
Prove that range voting disobeys ZIH.
(This can be regarded as a flaw in range voting; on the other hand, note that
optimal zero-info range voting strategy is never to be so-dishonest as to rank A>B
if you honestly feel B>A.)
</p><p>
<b>B.</b>

<p><b>Puzzle #86: Copeland is comparatively good with strategic voters</b>
<br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
The "Copeland" rank-order-ballot voting system elects whoever
wins the most pairwise contests.
(The "Copeland score," i.e.
total number of pairwise contests you win, must be between 0 and
N-1 inclusive in an N-candidate contest; pairwise-ties count as half.)
One of Copeland's defects is its propensity for having co-winners with
equal-maximal Copeland score.
It is important to add some
tie-breaking method to Copeland to repair that flaw.
In this puzzle we shall show that Copeland enjoys some advantages
related to strategic voters.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Show that Copeland is a "Condorcet voting method,"
</li><li>
Show that N-candidate Copeland <i>using Borda-score for tie-breaking</i> is
"highly resistant to burial strategy"
if N&le;4 in the following sense.
If C is the winner with honest votes, then the act by "X>C>others"-voters of "burying" C by
changing their vote to "X>others>C" can only elect X (at least if we neglect the
possibility of perfect pairwise-ties between two candidates) as a probability&rarr;0
event in the random-elections model in the limit of a large number of voters.
[Very few Condorcet methods enjoy such good burial-resistance, so this makes
Copeland quite special.]
</li><li>
But the reader is warned that this is a <i>limit</i> statement special to
the random elections model. Show that with N=3 and N=4, the act by
"X>C>others"-voters of "burying" C by
changing their vote to "X>others>C" <i>can</i> elect X.
</li><li>
If N&ge;5 show that burial does succeed in Copeland/Borda sometimes,
i.e. the act by "X>C>others"-voters of "burying" C by
changing their vote to "X>others>C" <i>can</i> elect X.
Indeed, in the <a href="RandElect.html">random elections model</a>, show burial
succeeds at least a <i>positive constant</i> fraction of the time.
</li><li>
Despite the ways (shown in this puzzle) in which Copeland is atypically strategy resistant
among Condorcet voting methods, it is poor in another way: it is very vulnerable to

Although it seems senseless to cast a rank-order ballot which includes a

"dumb totalizing" voting machines to process votes for all Condorcet systems based

the capability of such a machine to detect cycles and thus forbid
illegal votes, but if we make cyclic-votes <i>legal</i>, then there is no problem.)

The "YN-model" is a simple model of voting
(with a fair amount of realism) in which range voting
performs optimally with "honest voters."  
There are <i>m</i> independent "issues"
and 2<sup>m</sup> "candidates"; each candidate announces
a clear yes or no stance on each issue, and by some benificent miracle we have a full
democratic marketplace, i.e, every possible issue-stance is
represented.  Hence (in the case m=4) we can name the 16 candidates YYYY
("yes" on all 4 issues), YYYN, YYNY,..., NNNN.
Suppose, for each voter, the <i>utility</i> of electing
any given candidate is just the 
<i>number of issues</i>
on which that candidate agrees with the voter.
Finally, we suppose without loss of generality
that all <i>m</i> issues each would win if put to a single-issue
yes/no vote, therefore the objectively best candidate is YYYY.
<small>The "without loss of generality" is because we could just 
rename the issues to make "yes" become "no" for that issue, e.g. the issue
"raise taxes?" becomes "do not raise taxes," so with such canonical
renaming we can always cause
the best candidate to be named YYYY.
</small>
</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
Prove that <b>range</b> voting, with "honest voters" (who always score their
favorite <i>m</i>, their least-favorite 0, and everybody else linearly-interpolated
between according to their utility) 
will <i>always elect the best</i> candidate in the YN model (i.e,
here, YYYY).
</li><li>
But show that <b>plurality</b> voting can
unambiguously elect the worst candidate (here NNNN)
while causing the best candidate (YYYY) to have <i>zero</i> votes.
</li><li>
Hence <b>Instant Runoff</b> (and <b>Coombs</b>), in such an election,
would fail to elect YYYY.  
Can IRV ever elect the worst candidate NNNN?
</li><li>
Show that <b>Condorcet Cycles</b> can happen in the YN model.

Show that all <b>Condorcet</b> methods (with honest voters)

exactly backwards so that candidates with more Ns always are majority-preferred 
over those with fewer!
</li><li>
Show that <b>Borda</b> voting (with honest voters)
both can elect the worst candidate NNNN and order the candidates exactly backwards.
</li><li>
Show that <b>Approval</b> voting (with honest voters who approve the top F percent
of the available candidates and disapprove the rest, 
where F is any fixed value with 0&lt;F&le;50%)
can elect the worst candidate NNNN.

<p>
<b>Comment:</b>
Most analyses of voting system "properties" ignore the fact  that "issues" exist and candidates
have stances on them.  The YN model is approximately the simplest and most natural 
possible voting model which <i>doesn't</I> ignore that.   It turns out that honest range voting
is always optimal in the YN model and is "self consistent."  But most other commonly
proposed voting methods
turn out to be both "self contradictory" and non-optimal (indeed they can
even behave pessimally)
in the YN model.

<p><b>Puzzle #96 (Human "happiness" and Darwinian evolution):</b><br><small><font color="red">[2]</font></small>
Here are some nowadays well-accepted
scientific findings about the nature of human happiness (revealed by
survey studies).
Are all of these findings predicted by just one theory &ndash; Darwinian evolution?
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
If asked to choose between (i) get $240 and (ii) 25% chance of getting $1000, most people
choose (i).
But if asked to choose between (i) lose $740 and (ii) 75% chance of losing $1000, most people
choose ii.
</li><li>
More generally it seems people are assymetrically
risk-averse about losses but willing to take risks for gains.
choose ii.
</li><li>
Within a single country or region, people with more wealth and social status tend to be happier.
However, people in rich countries are not substantially happier than those in poor countries
(except for people so poor they are literally in danger of dying soon &ndash; they 
genuinely are less happy).
</li><li>
A person who has less stuff than his neighbors (e.g. they have a swimming pool, you do not), 
tends to be unhappy.  But that same person in the same circumstances would be happier
if transplanted to a different location with poor neighbors, so that now he had the most stuff
comparatively speaking.   I.e. happiness is not about absolute wealth, it is more
about relative wealth.
</li><li>
80% of your happiness level is explained purely by your preset "set point" which is determined
by genetics (or anyhow is not modifiable) and only 20% by the circumstances you
find yourself in.  If you improve/worsen your circumstances you get happier/sadder &ndash; but
only temporarily before returning to your "set point" (even though the improvement/worsening
is permanent).

<p><b>Puzzle #97 ("Allais Paradox" for utilities):</b><br><small><font color="red">[2]</font></small>
Maurice Allais conducted the following experiment in the 1950s. 
He asked people to preference-order the
following four alternatives:
<ol type="A">
<li>
You get $1 million.
</li><li>
Get $5M with chance 0.1, $1M with chance 0.89, and zero with
chance 0.01.
</li><li>
Get $1M with chance 0.11, and zero with chance 0.89.
</li><li>
Get $5M with chance 0.1 and zero with chance 0.90.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
Allais claimed that most people prefer A>B and D>C.
Does that make sense?
<ol type="a"><li>
Use "utilities" to
prove that anybody who prefers A>B (prefers A over B) must prefer C>D.
(This is true regardless of the utility values of the different amounts of money,
and it is also true if both the ">" relators are replaced by "<" or both by "=".)
</li><li>
So how can we explain Allais' survey finding?  Does it mean that the whole
utility model is not a good basis for human behavior? If so, what should it be replaced by?

The worst case D&rarr;0+ is plurality voting.
The best case is D=1 where the candidate nearest to 0 wins.
Range voting with a "stairstep" utility(distance)
function acts the same as that type of approval voting.

we get in the N&rarr;&infin; limit that the winner will lie
within distance &epsilon; of one of the two points

For example, the ballot  A=B&gt;C=D=E would yield Borda scores for C, D, and E of
(0+1+2)/3=1 each, and Borda scores for A and B of (3+4)/2=3.5 each.
</li><li>
However, the following natural generalization of the instant runoff voting (IRV) system's rules
to allow equalities in the rank-order ballots, will <i>not</i> necessarily
deliver the same winner as approval voting:
a ballot ranking K candidates co-equal top, is regarded as casting 1/K votes for each;
the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated (both from the election and all ballots);
and then we continue on recursively in the resulting (N-1)-candidate election until only
one candidate remains (who wins).

<p><b>Puzzle #114 (One quantitative measure of clone-immunity [Jack Rudd]):</b><br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
Suppose you have two camps of supporters, camp A and camp B. You have an
n-candidate election, in which 1 candidate (candidate A) is from camp A, and the
other candidates (B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>,..., B<sub>n-1</sub>)
are from camp B.
The A-supporters want to elect
A, the B-supporters want to elect anyone but A.
</p><p>
There is, however, a twist to this election: the A-supporters have to vote
<i>first</i>. Their votes are then displayed publicly, and the B-supporters vote in
response to this. Both camps can co-ordinate their votes so as to get an optimal
result from their point of view.
</p><p>
Let c be the least number such that, if the proportion of the electorate in the A
camp is greater than c, they can force the election of candidate A.
Then prove:
<ol type="a">
<li>
For Plurality, Top-Two Runoff, IRV and Condorcet voting, c=&frac12;.
</li><li>
For Approval and Range voting, c=&frac12;.
</li><li>
For Borda voting, c is a function of n. Find this function, and to what
value it converges as n tends to infinity.
</li><li>
Prove that for Anti-Plurality voting, c is a function of n. Find this function, and
to what value it converges as n&rarr;&infin;.
</li></ol>
<b>Extension:</b>
what happens if we remove the "twist" that the A-supporters vote first (now everybody votes
simultaneously by secret ballot)?

<p><b>Puzzle #115 (How often do "wrong winners" occur in real life with IRV [Clay Shentrup]):</b><br><small><font color="red">[2]</font></small>
Instant Runoff Voting (for example) can exhibit many paradoxes including
<a href="Monotone.html">nonmonotonicity</a>,
no-show paradox,
and <a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal failure</a>.
One form of nonmonotonicity is:
X wins, but increasing X in some votes causes X to <i>lose</i>
(or the time-reverse of this scenario <i>also</i> is non-monotonic).
One form of no-show paradox is:
X loses, but adding some new X-bottom votes causes X to win.
In reversal failure, X wins, but if all the votes are reversed ("trying to select                      
the worst candidate")
then X still "wins."
</p><p>
Suppose we examine real-life IRV elections
and find some percentage P
of elections in which you can tell that such a paradox existed.
Critics have objected to such discoveries by complaining: "But
this 'paradox' is merely <i>hypothetical</i>.  E.g. you <i>hypothesize</i> 
that some extra X-bottom voters appear, etc, causing the paradox. 
But <i>really</I> they did not. 
So your so-called paradox doesn't bother me.   I want to see <i>real life</i> elections 
where IRV clearly generated the 'wrong winner' otherwise I'm unimpressed."
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Argue that, even if there is no way to tell
who the "right winner" even was,
still, the percentage of IRV elections with wrong winners
due to such paradoxes, must be at least P/2.
</li><li>
Now attack your own last answer:
explain why
that argument to deduce P/2 as a lower bound, while
presumably approximately valid (and we recommend you believe it for practical purposes)
really is not rigorous.

<p><b>Puzzle #116 (Inferring political "positions" of politicians in D-space):</b><br><small><font color="red">[6]</font></small>
At present there are 100 senators, and each votes about 600 times on a yes-no question
during a 2-year senate.   Each senator's 600 bits are publicly known.  (Actually, some
senators abstain from voting sometimes, so there will be fewer than 600 bits; and
sometimes senators get replaced in the middle of the term, in which case there would be
more than 100 senators.)
Devise an algorithm to place the senators along a line ordered from "leftmost" to "rightmost,"
in such a way that nearby senators tend to usually agree in their votes, whereas far-apart
senators usually <i>dis</i>agree in their votes.
More generally, instead of a line, we could have a D-dimensional "issue space."
(D=2 is of interest for pictorial purposes, but we could also consider D=3, etc.)
Given some number D&gt;0,
devise an algorithm to place the senators as points in D-space
in such a way that nearby senators tend to usually agree in their votes, whereas far-apart
ones usually disagree.

<p><b>Puzzle #117 (Bayes-Laplace-Dirichlet law & "soft quorum" for range voting):</b><br><small><font color="red">[5]</font></small>
Suppose there is some binary quantity B (i.e. yes=1 or no=0, for example "do you think there
should be a $5/gallon gasoline tax?").
You ask a random sample of S&ge;0 people for their values of B, and the result is that
Y say "yes"
while N say "no"
where Y+N=S.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Given this data: what is the Bayesian estimate of the probability P
that a random person says "yes"?

And what is the variance in this estimate?
