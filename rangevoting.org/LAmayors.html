<H1> Los Angeles Mayor races 1960-2009, especially 2001 </H1>

<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, April 2009.  
Please send me <a href="HowToImprove.html">improvements</a>
or corrections. <a href="LAmayorTable.html">Historical table</a>.
</small></p>
<p>
We look at all LA mayor races from 1960 to now.
LA conducts mayor-elections via a 2-round runoff system essentially the
same as that used to elect the governor of <a href="LAgovs.html">Louisiana</a>.
</p><p>
<small>
As of 2009, Los Angeles
is the largest US city, and Louisiana is the only US state, 
that use this 2-round system. 
In contrast, New York City (which as of 2007 was by far
the largest US city) employs party primaries 
(which can involve a runoff, for example in 2001 Mark Green defeated Fernando Ferrer in
a 2-man runoff to win the Democratic party nomination; the original Democratic 
primary had 5 candidates with Green &amp; Ferrer finishing top-two) followed by a general
election, and in that election <i>at most one</i> candidate from each party runs.
In LA, there are <i>no</i> party primaries, <i>any</i>
number of candidates from any party can run, and
the top 2 finishers (who could be from either the same or different parties) compete in
a 2-person runoff if necessary.
Los Angeles was the 2nd largest US city as of 2007, with Chicago and Houston next.
Chicago and Houston both appear to use an election system similar to LA's.
</small>
</p><p>
From the standpoint of a voting theorist, most of these
races were not interesting, i.e. practically
every voting method would have elected the same winner.  
<i>But</i> an exceptionally interesting election occurred in <a href="#M2001">2001</a>.
If our educated guesses shown in the table 
below are correct, Villaraigosa would have won with 
instant runoff voting 
(<a href="Glossary.html#irv">IRV</a>, line 2),
and been nearly-tied with Hahn
with
<a href="Rangevoting.html">range</a> (line 3) 
<i>despite</i>
the fact that Hahn defeated Villaraigosa in the official head-to-head two-man later
runoff election!  (This is not a misprint.)
</p><p>
<i>If</i> that range-voting near-tie had broken Villaraigosa's way this would be
the only real-world election known to us as of April 2009
in which there is a reasonable amount of evidence 
range voting would have "overruled a voter majority" 
because the minority expressed stronger preferences than the majority
(range voting
allows strength of preference information in votes).  
However, see also line 4.
Plain plurality and IRV would <i>also</i> have elected Villaraigosa
(but for different reasons than range) thus <i>also</i> overruling that voter majority.
The reader may want to consider what she thinks about that and compare with
our <a href="#Philos">view</a>.

<h2> The LA mayor races 1961-2009 &ndash; Quick Summary </h2>

<p>
<b>1961-1969:</b>
Sam W. <b>Yorty</b> won the mayorship in 1961, 1965, and 1969.
The 1961 win was a surprise defeat of 
incumbent Republican mayor (1953-1961) C. Norris Poulson.
By 1969
Yorty had become unpopular with a scandal-ridden administration; 
3 of his commissioners 
had been convicted 
on bribery charges, a 4th was awaiting trial; and
Yorty, although initially popular with blacks,
had failed as promised to repair widespread misconduct by the LA police department or
to challenge police chief Parker.
The black lawyer and former police lieutenant
Thomas J. Bradley (endorsed by the <i>LA Times</i>)
had been expected to
win in 1969 based both on pre-election polls and the fact that he was ahead of Yorty by
over 100,000 votes in the first election round 
(Bradley took 42% of the votes versus Yorty's 26%).
But Yorty beat him in the second and final round 53-to-47%
by using racial and 
militant/radical/communist slurs.  Although these were quite unjustified, in
the racially-charged atmosphere after the Watts riot of 1965, they 
were fearful enough to work.
Yorty was a Democrat but often supported Republicans and
in the 1970s become a Republican.
</P>

<p>
<b>1973-1992:</b>
Thomas J. <b>Bradley</b> won the 1973 rematch with Yorty
<!--By that time the atmosphere in LA had become less racially-charged.-->
and then won re-election in 1977, 1981, 1985 and 1989.
In all Bradley served 5 terms over a 20-year period.
He was only the second African-American mayor of a major U.S. city.
Long-duration reigns like Bradley's became impossible
later because, e.g, Riordan was forbidden to run again
after serving 2 terms,
due to a term-limit law.
Winning margins: 
<pre>
1977: 59% (over twice Robbins' vote),
1981: 64% (about twice Yorty's vote),
1985: 68%,
1989: 51.8%
</pre>
In none of these cases was a second runoff-round needed.
</p><p><small>
Bradley was also famed in political-polling circles for the 
so-called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect">Bradley effect</a>.
That concerned his failed 1982 run for California <i>governor</i>.
Bradley was ahead in polls but lost the actual election to George Deukmejian(R) by 52,295
votes. 
Some theorize this discrepancy was due
to racist voters who lied to the pollsters.
</small></p>

<p>
<b>1993:</b>
Richard <b>Riordan</b>(R), a 63-year-old rich venture capitalist,
won a 54-to-46% victory over
Mike Woo(D, age 41) in the runoff on 8 June.  
The first round on April 20
had given Riordan and Woo 33% and 24% respectively
followed by Joel Wachs (12%), Richard Katz (10%) and Linda Griego (8%).
There were 24 candidates in all.
For portraits of the most prominent, see
Jane Fritsch's article in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> 
18 April 1993; these included 8 democrats including Woo but only 1 republican, Riordan.
Bradley, age 75, did not run for the first time in 24 years.
Woo was endorsed by the <i>LA Times</i>, Bill Clinton, and County Supervisor Gloria Molina and
was widely expected to win the runoff.  
Riordan spent $6 million of estimated $100 million personal fortune to
fund his campaign.  Whites voted Riordan by over a 2:1 ratio, while
the other racial groups supported Woo.  The net result, according to polls,
is Woo would have won with 100% turnout, <i>but</i> since
the demographic groups supporting Riordan turned out in higher percentages &ndash;
"Moderates" and "Conservatives" and voters earning over $20K/year all supported Riordan &ndash;
he won.
Riordan became the first Republican mayor 
in over thirty years.
</p>
<blockquote>
<small>
<i>LA Times</I>: 9 June 1993 page 1 article
"Exit Poll Finds Voters Sought Lesser of 2 Evils" by Richard Simon:
Those who supported Woo said they were influenced by his reaching out to minorities and his 
early opposition to former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. They also said they were turned 
off by charges that millionaire Riordan was trying to buy the election and to a far lesser 
degree by Riordan's alcohol-related arrests.
<br>
Riordan apparently struck a chord with his mailers and TV ads portraying Woo as an ineffective 
politician. Nearly half of Riordan's supporters cited Woo's council record as their reason for 
supporting Riordan.
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>turnout</i> in the first round was 32% of registered voters (NY Times 22 april p.16)
and of those no candidate received more than 33%, which is why it went to a runoff.
In the runoff round,
Riordan won by (according to initial
figures reported by NY Times 10 June 1993 page 1) 302786 to Woo's
259820.
The turnout was 44% of registered voters.
Note the turnout increased from 32% round 1 to 44% in round 2.
</p>

<p>
<b>1997:</b><!--8 April-->
Richard <b>Riordan</b>(R)
won re-election with 61.5%, defeating
Tom Hayden(D, 34.5%) and 3 other minor rivals.
</p>

<p>
<b>2001:</b>
Complicated and interesting 15-candidate 2-round election
ultimately won by James K. <b>Hahn</b>(D).
[Riordan was not running due to term-limit law.]
Will be discussed <a href="#M2001">below</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>2005:</b>
Councilman Antonio <b>Villaraigosa</b> (former speaker of CA assembly)
defeated sitting mayor James K. Hahn, becoming the city's
first Hispanic mayor since the 19th century.  Two rounds needed.

</table>
<p>
Based on this data, the only reasonably-plausible way to contend 
Villaraigosa was a "wrong winner" in this election would be to postulate that
Hertzberg was the "right winner."    
(Which would have been possible if, e.g, enough Hahn voters preferred RMH&gt;AV.)
<small>
Incidentally, the <i>LA Times</i> endorsed both AV and RMH in round #1.
RMH endorsed AV in round #2.
</small>
</p>
<p>
On 28 Feb. 2005 the <i>LA Times</i> asked 710 "likely voters" by telephone:<br>
"Among rivals of James K. Hahn, who has the most
honesty and integrity?" The results were
</p>
<pre>
A.Villaraigosa    23%
R.M.Hertzberg     17%
B.C.Parks         16%
R.Alarcon          7%
others/don't know 37%
</pre>
<p>
which suggests that if
Hahn were removed from the picture then Villaraigosa would still have been
preferred versus Hertzberg.
[But the wording's restriction to "honesty and integrity" makes that less clear
than one would want, plus the (16+7+37=60)% other-way pollees confuse the issue.]
This is supporting evidence that Villaraigosa was the "right winner."
But it remains entirely possible (indeed, I consider it more likely than not)
that Hertzberg "should have" placed <i>2nd</i> instead of Hahn
since, e.g, enough Villaraigosa voters preferred him over Hahn but were not allowed to say
so in their votes.  This problem (if it existed)
would still have occurred with "instant runoff voting" since IRV would have ignored
RMH&gt;JKH preferences of Villaraigosa voters; but it would not have occurred with 
range voting.  Indeed, a range-style telephone poll of 710 likely voters
was conducted 22-27 February 2005 by the <i>LA Times</i> which confirmed this thinking:
</p>

"Averages" based on equispaced rating scale VF=3, SF=2, SU=1, VU=0 but the same finish order

</p>

<p>
<b>2009:</b>
Antonio <b>Villaraigosa</b> re-elected in the first round (3 March) election by 56.6% majority
(hence no runoff 2nd round occurred).
Villaraigosa outspent Walter Moore by a ratio of 15 to 1.
Moore got 22.1% of the vote; everybody else got less than 8.5% each. 10 candidates ran in all.

<h2> The interesting 2001 election </h2>

<p>
The outgoing mayor R.Riordan,
the <i>LA Daily News</I>, and the <i>Daily Breeze</i> all endorsed Steve Soboroff(R);
while the <i>LA Times</i> issued a dual endorsement of 
James K. Hahn and Antonio Villaraigosa (both Democrats).
The results of the first round (10 April) were:
</p>
<table cellpadding="2" border="1">

<p>
Runoff (i.e. second and final round, held 5 June; note the turnout increased by over 50,000
voters in the 2nd round versus that in the 1st round):

</table>
<p>
For the second round, 
Riordan switched his endorsement to Villaraigosa; 
and Wachs, long-time county supervisor Gloria Molina, the AFL-CIO, 
the California Democratic party,
and the <i>LA Times</i>
also endorsed him (while
Soboroff and Becerra remained neutral).  
Despite this and his win in the primary, Villaraigosa did not get enough support from
Soboroff &amp; co's voters so Hahn defeated him.
</p>
<p>
<I>LA Times</i> pre-election polls indicated that Soboroff's voters were overwhelmingly white,
but unfortunately for him in that respect he suffered a vote-split with Connell and Wachs.
With IRV, range, or approval voting that vote-split would not have existed,
which with IRV probably would have moved Soboroff ahead of Hahn into 2nd place.

J.Rainey &amp; G.Krikorian:
THE MAYOR'S RACE; Hahn Won on His Appeal to Moderates, Conservatives,
<I>LA Times</i> 7 June 2001 page A1.
Exit-poll interviews of 3427 voters as left 62 polling places.
"Hahn's advantage came mainly from  voters who previously had backed Republican businessman
Steve Soboroff and Councilman Joel Wachs in the first round of the election.
Soboroff voters went 83% to Hahn and Wachs' voters 62% for Hahn in Tuesday's vote, 
<i>The Times</i> exit poll found."
<br><br>
Michael Finnegan:
Valley's White Conservative Voter Bloc Backs Soboroff Series,
<i>LA Times</i>  6 April 201 page B1.
"Early in the campaign, mayoral candidate Joel Wachs, a city councilman, was widely seen as a
potential favorite of those conservatives. But [Steve Soboroff], according to a Times poll 
published this week, has pulled well ahead of Wachs among that group.
Among all likely voters, Soboroff is in a tight race with two other leading candidates, 
... Hahn and... Villaraigosa."
<br><br>
If all 60K of the "moderate" and "conservative" white voters for Wachs and Connell had voted
for Soboroff while their 30K "liberal" whites split between V &amp; H,
that would have been 
equivalent to introducing about 45K extra Soboroff votes.
Those not only would have moved Soboroff ahead of Hahn, but indeed would have given him
a near-tie for the lead with Villaraigosa.  However, Villaraigosa also suffered a Latino
vote-split with Becerra and hence, if that too were removed, would have returned to the lead.
Actually probably this 60K-30K monolithic-split model was too pro-Soboroff biased, but
even if it were, say, 50K-40K, or even 45K-45K, then still that would have been enough
to move Soboroff ahead of Hahn.  So it seems clear that Soboroff would have been second,
not Hahn, with single transferable voting. <b>End of details.</b>
</small>
</p><p>
If so (assuming the election rules still finished with a 2-man runoff)
Hahn would not have been in that runoff and hence would have lost.
<!--(The <i>LA Times</i> polls also concluded that
Villaraigosa [had] solid backing among Latinos and Jews,"
while Hahn enjoyed strong support from Black voters.)-->
</p>
<h3>Was Hahn a "wrong winner"? What would have happened with other voting systems?</h3>
<p>
As we've seen, it is probable that with <b>Instant Runoff Voting</b>
Hahn would not have made it into the top two (which would have been
Villaraigosa vs. Soboroff) whereupon probably <b>Villaraigosa</b> would have won.
However, the legitimacy of that Villaraigosa victory could be questioned
because of the fact that Hahn defeated him 53.5-to-46.5% 
in the head-to-head runoff!
</p>
<p><small>
Incidentally, this IRV election (with V defeating S in the final round)
would have exhibited a "favorite betrayal" pathology:
the Soboroff&gt;Hahn&gt;Villaigarosa 
voters would
have been better off dishonestly-strategically voting for Hahn.
Indeed, quite possibly, they in fact did so.
</small></p>
<p>
But with <b>range or approval voting</b>, the fact that the Villaraigosa voters
(who were the liberalest) tended to prefer Hahn&gt;Soboroff
would have been able to come into play, which probably
would have prevented Soboroff from making it into the top 2.   
(IRV would have ignored these preferences,
but Approval and Range would have taken them into account.)
Hence our prediction (or "postdiction") would be that the top two would still have
been <b>Villaraigosa &amp; Hahn</b>. 
</p>

<p>
What would have happened then?
Approval- and range-style polls (as well as "second choice" and plurality-voting-style)
all were conducted in this election by the <i>LA Times</i>,
and their results were interesting:

"Averages" in the range-voting tables above were computed using equally-spaced scores
VF=3, SF=2, SU=1, VU=0.
However, equal spacing was not necessary in June;
Hahn's victory was clear since he
would have won using <i>any</i> VF&gt;SF&gt;SU&gt;VU.
In April, most reasonable weights except for those highly-resembling "approval voting"
(meaning VF=SF=1, SU=VU=0)
would also have yielded a near-tie in which the Villaraigosa-Hahn margin was smaller
than the exit poll's statistical error.  But Hahn won with approval voting
both using the above data and also with this poll data from late-February:

Graphical studies indicate that IRV is "biased" to 
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">favor extremists</a>
while approval voting is biased to
<a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">favor centrists</a>.
Range voting, however, has little or no such bias.
These vague views are fully supported by the data in the present election,
viewing Villaraigosa as leftist, Hahn as centrist, and Soboroff as rightist.

<h3> What about some less-discussed voting systems: Borda, Condorcet, and 
Median-based "range" voting? </h3>

<p>
With <a href="Glossary.html#Borda">Borda</a> voting,
because there were 15 candidates the temptation and power of strategic voting would have been 
overwhelming (with a strategic voter having &asymp;14 times greater discriminating power
among the top contenders, than an honest one), and the situation is a textbook setup for
a <a href="DH3.html">DH3 pathology</a> guaranteeing that <i>none</i> of the apparent "top 3"
(Hahn, Villaraigosa, Soboroff) could win and thus assuring victory for a "dark horse"
such as Connell.
(<a href="rangeVborda.html#bossbulb">Read</a> a story about just such a DH3 pathology.)
<small>
In contrast, 
with range and approval voting DH3 cannot occur since the usual forms of strategic voting 
do not misorder candidates (there is no strategic purpose served by doing so that could not
be served as well or better without misordering).
</small>
</p>
<p>
With <i>honest</i>
<a href="Glossary.html#condmeths"> Condorcet</a>  voting, it seems clear <b>Hahn</b>
would have won (since the V voters 
preferred H&gt;S,
while the S voters preferred H&gt;V).  Indeed, we can tell
that the finish-order among the "Big Three" would
have been Hahn&gt;Vilaraigosa&gt;Soboroff.
However, the DH3 pathology also can occur with 
Condorcet voting and hence with strategic voters put in the mix I do not know
what would have happened.  E.g. quite plausibly Connell would have won.
</p>
<p>
M.Balinski &amp; R.Laraki have suggested a voting system like range voting
but in which the greatest <i>median</I> (not the greatest <I>average</i>) score wins.
With median-based range it would have been at least a 6-way tie since all 6 of 
the top 6 candidates in the April 2001 race have the same median
score ("Somewhat Favorable", SF).   
Exact ties are common with medians but extremely rare with averages,
which is why Balinski &amp; Laraki recommend a certain <i>tiebreaking procedure</i>.
If we apply that procedure then
<b>Villaraigosa</b> would have won since after remove &kappa; of the SF scores
(where &kappa; is any constant with 20%&lt;&kappa;&lt;28%)
from each candidate, then only Villaraigosa still has median score SF;
all the others then have median=SU or worse.
[Jameson Quinn points out his
alternative "GMJ" and "MAV" tie-breaking methods also enthrone Villaraigosa.]
The Balinski-Laraki <a href="MedianVrange.html">system</a> has a number of disadvantages
versus ordinary average-based range voting (e.g. it is more complicated) two
of which are visible in
this election:
<ol>
<li>
Nonmedian ratings are largely ignored.  For example, Connell's score-distribution
was (VF,SF,SU,VU)=(16,46,27,11)%.  If this had been changed to
(16,46,0,38)
or
(16,46,38,0)
that would have represented a fairly large change in the perceived quality of Connell.
Indeed, the latter change would have moved her up to third place with mean score 1.78
and the former down to
6th (or much worse) in the view of ordinary 
range voting.  Meanwhile analagous changes could have moved Villaigarosa and Hahn's
mean scores down to 1.76.
But all these changes would have been <i>invisible</I> to Balinski &amp; Laraki's voting method.
And indeed, the average rating of Hahn exceeded that of Villaraigosa but Balinski &amp; Laraki
ignored the outer ratings that caused that and thus elected
Villaraigosa.
</li><li>
Adding "all-zero ballots" can alter the election result with Balinski &amp; Laraki's system 
(but cannot affect it with ordinary range voting, approval, etc).
In particular, in the LA 2001 election their system elected Villaraigosa,
but if an extra 33% worth of voters had magically 
appeared, all voting "all zero ballots" (i.e. scoring
every contender&le;"very unfavorable") then Hahn would have been victorious with
the uniquely maximal median score "SF" (and thus no need for tiebreaking).
</li>
</ol>

<h3> What is our view about range voting occasionally (and perhaps in LA 2001) 
"overruling voter majorities"? </h3>

<p>
As we have seen, Villaraigosa would have won with IRV and <i>might</i> have won with range voting
(too close to call)
on 10 April.   Assuming for the purposes of argument that Villaraigosa would indeed
have won with Range, that would be a fascinating situation in which Range Voting, like IRV,
actually went
<i>against</I> a voter-majority.  What do we think of that?
</p>

<p>
From the <i>theoretical</i> point of view (both abstractly, and
looked at in the particular case of this LA 2001 election), it does not bother me:
<ol>
<li>
If
47% of voters prefer V&gt;H strongly while 53% of voters prefer H&gt;V weakly,
then <i>if the voters were being honest</i>
then in my view it is better for society that V win; range voting <i>worked</i>.
</li><li>
If the voters were instead being <i>strategic</i> (i.e. sometimes dishonest)
about their preference-strengths then it is less-clear that V should win;
but <i>if</i> this sort of strategicness acted in a  balanced manner in both directions, then 
I still contend V should win.  Hence in general I believe (and this is supported by 
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> simulation-measurements) 
that range will deliver a better
winner on average than unweighted voting.  
</li><li>
In the particular LA 2001 mayor election
here, Villaigarosa voters tended to prefer V&gt;H&gt;S
since V was "liberal," H "moderate," and S "conservative."
Under these circumstances, "strategy" presumably have caused greater exaggerating
of H&gt;V preference strengths than V&gt;H preference strengths because the V-voters,
by exaggerating, would have been risking a greater backfire (i.e. electing S).
<i>Despite</i> any such advantages Hahn may have enjoyed in the range-exit-poll due to such
strategic lying to pollsters, V <i>still</i> defeated H in that poll (assuming
favorable tie-break).
<br><br>
I would conclude (under this tie-break assumption)
that V was the "right winner"; and the LA voters themselves seemed
to agree V's defeat was (in hindsight) a mistake,
since they elected V over the <i>incumbent</i> H in the next (2005) election.
<br><br>
In other words, any attack on range voting's
overrule of majority vote based on hypotheses about strategy, fails because strategy
would, if anything, have worked in the opposite logical direction.  [Also, if
one believes range voters would have been more strategic in a real election than in a poll,
then that would either have had no effect or
would have caused H to win the range-voting-election, in which case
there would have been no "overrule" and the whole issue would be moot.  
This in fact is exactly what happened in June's 2-contender range poll and
also in the approval-voting polls, experimentally confirming the thinking in previous sentence.]
</ol><p>
From the <i>propaganda</i> point of view, though, this property of range voting could 
hurt it since propagandists will use it to attack range voting.
Indeed, this already has happened with IRV-propagandists at "FairVote"
attacking range voting for precisely this reason.   In the 2001 LA
election we are speaking of here, 
however, the IRV-propagandists have some difficulty employing that attack
since 
</p><ol>
<li>
Villaraigosa did not clearly-win with range voting; instead it was a too-close-to-call near-tie
between V &amp; H.
</li><li>
IRV <i>also</i> would have "overruled the voter majority" and elected Villaigarosa
(and on this, the 
<a href="#Irv05details">evidence</a> 
is clear).
</li>
</ol>
