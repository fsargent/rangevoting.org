<p><b>Abstract.</b>
<br>
1. We argue "range voting" is the best single-winner voting method
among all commonly proposed alternatives.  Measurements &amp; estimates 
<a href="LivesSaved.html">indicate</a>
that if adopted instead of the currently most-used system, "plurality voting,"
humanity's lot would improve by an amount comparable to or exceeding the
improvement got from switching from undemocratic forms of government to
democracy.   Conservative estimate:
each day's delay in getting range voting
costs (in statistical sense) 5000 lives.
</p><p>
2. We argue (by analysing an explicit political <a href="StratSumm.html">strategy</a>
to get it)
range voting is, in fact, an obtainable dream.

<H2> World situation: crises approaching.  Need good decision-making. </H2>

<p>
Major incoming crises:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://hubbert.mines.edu/">End</a> of cheap oil, 
</li><li>
Global fisheries <a href="Fisheries.html">species collapse</a>,
</li><li>
Exhaustion of important fossil water reserves,

<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf">Climate change</a>,

Overpopulation, 
</li><li>
Nuclear and bioweapon proliferation.
</li></ol>

<p>
Important that world make the right decisions. 
But what is world's decision-making algorithm?
</p>

<p>
US now sole superpower &rArr;
closest simple approximation to the answer = USA's 
appalling voting system.  Features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Voters can easily elect the candidate 
they <a href="LoseAll.html">least</a> want (even just among the Two)
thanks to "spoiler" and "cloning" pathologies.
</li>
<li>Rampant <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a> seemingly worse than most democracies; </li>
<li>An elected partisan official in charge of supervising elections in 33 out of 50 states 
(and in other states  appointed by the governor &ndash; maybe even worse); </li>
<li>98% year-ahead <a href="NonVoters.html">predictability</a> of all important races 
(largest among democratic nations) 
and <i>uncontested</i> state house races about a third of the time; </li>
<li>Massive two-party <a href="Strangle.html">domination</a> (over 99.5%)
causing opposing views to be almost completely blocked out of both power and the media; </li>
<li>Electoral college  inspires candidates to cater only to "swing states," ignore rest; </li>
<li>Highly restrictive ballot-access <a href="BallAccess.html">laws</a> in many states designed to ensure two-party (or one-party) domination not just in <i>office</i> but also on the <i>ballot</i>. 
(Lieberman's run would have been illegal in 46/50 states.) </li>

An 11-voter, 6-candidate election (candidates A,B,C,D,E,F)
</caption>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
<b>Plurality:</b> A wins (most top-rank votes with 4).
<br>
<b>Plurality+Runoff among top two:</b> B wins over A in the runoff, 6-to-5.
<br>
<b>Instant Runoff (IRV):</b> C wins
(eliminate E, D, F, and B in that order &ndash;  doesn't matter which way you break 
DF tie &ndash; then C beats A in final round 7 to 4).
IRV repeatedly deletes the candidate with fewest
top-rank votes, then the remaining one wins.

<!-- Note, when F is eliminated, there
is a tie between F and C which we assume is broken in favor of C because
all the F-voters have C as their second choice at that point, whereas the C-voters
rank F near last place.  (If 
you are morally opposed to this tie-breaking gimmick, then a 19-voter solution with
7,5,4,2,1 in the #voters column does the job.) -->
<br>
<b>Borda:</b> D wins.   
(D's Borda score is 16+9+4+5+2=36 versus E with 12+12+6+1+3=34 and 
with lower scores for A, B, C, and F.)  In the Borda system a candidate gets awarded
0 points if ranked last, 1 if ranked second-last, 2 if...  and the candidate
with the greatest score-sum ("Borda count") wins.
<br>
<b>Condorcet:</b> E wins.  (Since E pairwise-beats each other candidate, e.g. beating
A 6:5, B 6:5, C 7:4, D 6:5, and F 9:2.)
<br>
<b><a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval</a> Voting:</b> 
If all the <font color="red">red</font> candidates are "approved," then F wins with
7 approvals (versus A=4, B=5, C=3, D=6, E=5).
</p>

<p>
And with 0-99 <b>Range Voting</b>, 
it would in fact be possible to make <i>any</i> of the 6 
candidates win,
depending on how the voters chose the scores compatibly with the orderings above.
In Range Voting each voter awards a score from 0 to 99 to each candidate;
greatest average score wins.
(<a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.org">Fancier rules</a> allow also scoring a candidate with 
X = intentional blank = "no opinion" &ndash; only numerical scores incorporated 
into averages.)

<li>
If every voter prefers A to B then so does group.</li>
<li>
Relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their
relative positions in the individual rankings, but do <I>not</i> depend on the
individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C.</li>
</ol>
"This discovery was a major factor in Arrow winning the Nobel Prize in Economics."
</p>

<p>
Commonly heard: "Arrow's theorem shows that no 'best' voting system exists."
<br>
"Proof":
By Arrow, for every voting system, including the putative "best" system B,
exists an election which makes it look bad.  Construct system A which looks good in that situation.
Then A is "superior" to B so B cannot be best. Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<b>That all is wrong.</b>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> satisfies all three
criteria, accomplishing the "impossible"!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Huh?
</li><li>
Arrow's definition of "voting system" excludes range voting.
</li><li>
Oh.
</li><li>
True lesson of Arrow's theorem = stay away from voting systems based 
on rank-order ballots. 
</li><li>
(Reinforcement:
I have a <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper</a>
in which I construct "universal counterexamples"
which make <i>every</i> voting method based on <i>finite</i> set of
vote-types look bad [min-utility winners]
while range voting [continuum infinity of vote-types] looks
good [max-utility winner].)
</li>
</ul>

Bogusness.  "Property based" thinking 
misled all of political science for 50 years.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="howtoeval"></a>
<H2>  Three ways to (try to) seek a best voting system </H2>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>1. Look at human elections through <a href="FunnyElections.html">history</a>, 
or artificial ones (paid subjects).</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real; right sample space.
<br>
Cons[Historical]: Often hard to assess 
how "good" different election results were or would have been
and what results "would" have occurred 
had other election method X had been used instead.  
(And subjective. And you'll be accused of bias.)
Also, still not really correct sample 
space (since space might <a href="Duverger.html">change</a> over time with new X...).
<br>
Cons[Paid subjects]: 
Very expensive.  Not really real.   
<br>
Cons[Both]: Little data &rArr; low statistical significance &rArr; few results.  
And people lie to pollsters.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>2. Find planet; create eusocial lifeform that needs to conduct elections
as important part of life-cycle; better decisions via the elections &rArr; more fitness;
put on planet; wait 20-200 million years; see
what voting system Darwinian evolution comes up with.</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real (arguably more real than with humans).   Lots of data &rArr; high significance.
<br>
Cons: Spare planets unavailable in local drug store.
<br>
Pros: Already been done at least twice on this planet (social insects)!! <i>Hundreds of
trillions</i> of very-important-to-the-insects elections so far! <i>All</i> voting systems
considered (in some sense).
</dd>
<dt>
<b>3. Measure "Bayesian regret" of different election methods via computer election sims.
</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Large amounts of data &rArr; statistical significance is no problem.
Artificial cyber-voters better than humans: 
Can read their  "minds" to
find their true desires unpolluted by lies 
(measured in standard "happiness units" too).
<br>
Cons: Computer results out = only as good as the assumptions &amp; models in.
Only try voting systems you try, not all possible.
<br>
Pros: 
Can try large number of assumption sets &amp; models.  If so lucky that
in <i>all</i> of them, one voting method robustly is best, convincing.
<br>
Con: If not so lucky &ndash; some methods best in this model, others best in that &rArr;
bummer.
</dd>

<hr>
<a name="bayregm"></a>
<H2>  What is Bayesian Regret? </H2>

<p>
<b>Oversimplified into nutshell:</b>
"Bayesian regret" of election method E is 
"expected avoidable human unhappiness"
caused by using E.
</p>

<p>
<b>More precise answer:</b>
Bayesian regret is gotten via this <i>procedure</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter has a personal
"utility" value for the election of each candidate.
(E.g, if Nixon elected, then Jill Voter acquires -55 extra lifetime happiness units.)
In computer simulation,  "voters" &amp; "candidates" are artificial,
and the utility numbers are generated by 
some randomized "utility generator" and assigned
artificially to each candidate-voter pair.
</li>
<li>
Now the voters vote, based both on their private utility
values, and (if strategic voters)
on their perception from "pre-election polls"
(also generated artificially within the simulation, e.g. from
a random subsample of "people") of how
the other voters are going to act.
<br><font size="-1">(Note.  Some people here have gotten the wrong impression
that this is <i>assuming</I> that voters will be "honest" or that we are
assuming that honest range voters
will use candidate-utilities as their candidate-scores.  Neither impression is correct:
These assumptions are not made.)</font>
</li>
<li>
Election system E elects some winning candidate W.
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for W, is
the "<font color="blue">achieved societal utility</font>."
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for X,
<i>maximized</i> over all candidates X, is
the "<font color="blue">optimum societal utility</font>" which would have been
achieved if the election system had magically chosen the 
societally best candidate.
</li>
<li>
The <font color="blue">difference</font>
between 5 and 4 is the "<font color="blue">Bayesian Regret</font>"
of the election system E, at least in this experiment.
It might be zero, but if E was bad or if this election was unlucky for E, then
it will be positive because W and X will be different candidates.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Redo steps 1-6 zillion times
(i.e. do zillion simulated elections) to find 
<i>average Bayesian regret</i> of election system E.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
The Bayesian regret of an election system E may differ if we
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vary the number of voters, 
</li>
<li>
Vary the number of candidates, 
</li>

<li>
Vary the kind of "utility generator" (e.g. could be based on different numbers of "issues"
with different methods for generating the locations of the candidates in "issue space"),
</li>
<li>
Use different kinds of assumed "voter strategy", or 
</li>
<li>
Put different amounts of "voter ignorance". (*)
</li>
</ol>
(*) Can put in
voter ignorance by artificially adding random noise to 
voter's private utility values, and then make voters act
based on <i>distorted</i> values.  Higher amplitude
noise &rArr; more ignorance.
</p>

<p>

&exist; at least 5 different "knobs" to "turn" on our 
machine for measuring Bayesian Regret of elctn method E.
</p>


<hr>

<H2> Results of 1999 computer simulation 
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">study</a>:</H2>

<p>
Measured Bayesian regrets for about 30 different election methods.
720  different "knob setting"  combinations  tried.
Amazing result: in <i>all</i> 720 scenarios, range voting
was best (had lowest Bayesian regret, up to statistically insignificant
noise).  We repeat: RV best in <i>every single one</i>
of those 720 with either honest <i>or</i>
strategic
voters, regardless of ignorance-level, #candidates (3-5), 
#voters (5-200), #issues (0-&infin;)
etc.

<H2> How much does RV matter to humanity? </H2>

<p>
<b>1. RV=comparable improvement over democracy as <i>invention</i> of democracy.</b>
Both transitions
non-democracy(modeled by "random winner" or better) &rarr;
democracy(strategic plurality voting) &rarr; 
Range Voting (halfway between honest &amp; strategic BR numbers)
<i>comparable</i> in terms of BR reduction; if anything second looks <i>larger</i>.
</p>

<p><b>2. Democide:</b>
<blockquote>
During this [the 20th] century's wars, there were some 38 million battle deaths,
but almost four times more people &ndash; at least 170 million &ndash;
were killed by governments for ethnic, racial, tribal,
religious, or political reasons. I call this phenomenon
<i>democide</i>, and it means that authoritarian and totalitarian
governments are more deadly than war.<br>
&ndash;
<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/PERSONAL.HTM">R.J.Rummel</a>
(prof. Emeritus, U.Hawaii),
in his book <i>Death by Government</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rummel on his <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE5.HTM">democide statistics website<a/>
gives corrections now finding the democide body count during 1900-1999 to be
262,000,000, which is <i>six</i> times the war dead and equiv. to 7200 killed per day.
</p>

<p><b>3. Government waste:</b>
Economist Martin Bailey estimates US Govt spending is 50% waste (e.g. same power military could
be got with half the money, etc.); detailed tabulation in his <a href="RVPapers.html">book</a>.
That 50% is $1.1 Trillion/year, which is equivalent to 4.4 million lives per year,
i.e. 12050 lives/day.
(At rate of 1 life=$250,000 earned per world-average life).
</p>

<p><b>4. Life expectancy &amp; GNP/capita:</b>
Are significantly higher (on average) in democracies.
(E.g: [a] Life expectancy in E.Germany jumped 6 years since reunification;
[b] <!-- Taiwan 76.6 vs China 70.5 also 6 years; -->
Taiwan 77.4 vs China 71 also 6 years;
[c] Compare North with South Korea;
[d] check Vanhanen's &amp; Barro's large cross-country datasets and fits.)
This leads to numbers &asymp;30,000 lives/day or more.
</p>

<p><b>5. Saving world via better decisions:</b>
Suppose USA, by adopting range voting, lowers risk of 2-billion population 
crash in 50 years, by 5%.  That's 5500 lives/day.
</p>
<H2> Gazillionaire donors: listen up! </H2>

<p>
Range voting gives you more "bang" for your buck than almost any other philanthropic option.
Maybe the most lives saved for this small an effort.
And you can be in the steep part of the learning curve by seeding the <i>start</i> of
the RV movement, getting <i>huge</i> leverage for your money.

<H2> Barro's multiD least-square fit, cross-country study  </H2>

<a href="BarroGDPfit.html"><img src="BarroPlot.png" width="527" height="697" 
alt="Barro's democracy vs GDP growth-rate plot" hspace="10" align="right"></a>

<p>
Book R.J.Barro:
<a href="RVPapers.html">Determinants of Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Empirical Study</a>
predicts growth rate of country's real GDP 
from facts about country.
GDP growth enhanced by:
<ul>
<li> 
low <i>initial</i> per capita real
GDP  (then tech transfer causes fast growth; 
appears to be biggest effect in Barro's list)
</li><li> 
more secondary and higher levels of schooling, 
</li><li> 
longer life expectancy (which presumably means good health)
</li><li> 
lower fertility rates, 
</li><li> 
lower government expenditures as GDP fraction
</li><li> 
more "rule of law"
</li><li> 
favorable trade relations with other countries (e.g. the USA made trade with Cuba
illegal, severely hurt Cuban economy) 
</li><li> 
high inflation (over 20% annually) kills economic growth
</li><li> 
<i>Democracy</i>.
</ul>

<p>
<i>But</i> democracy increases GDP in peculiar way (pictured):
increases in Barro's  political rights index from 0 to 5.6 on a scale of 0-10
(yielding a moderate level of freedom and democracy)
increased GDP growth rates additively by 2.6% 
<i>but</i> a further increase in the index from 5.6 to 10
<i>retarded</i> growth by <i>negative</i> 1.6%.
</p>

<p>
All of Barro's causative
factors (listed) cause approximately equal additive effects on predicted
real-GDP-growth-rate,
namely about 2-5% each.  That is, having the optimum level 5.6 of political rights
causes about 2.6% higher (additively) annual GDP growth rate than the pessimal
level 0;  countries about one standard deviation above usual in education levels are
predicted to have about 3% higher than usual annual-GDP-growth;
etc.
</p>

<p>
Correlation&ne;certainty so
democracy does not force a good economy.  E.g, China  doing better than India.
</p>

<H3> Why that peaking and downturn? </H3>

<p>
<b>Barro</b>
ideologically tries to explain by postulating:
more democracy &rArr; more government income redistribution &rArr; hurts growth.
But <b>attackable</b> because
Barro's fit <i>already</i> had incorporated government
expenditures
as <i>different</i> predictor; democratization was only being fit to
<i>unexplained</i> part of the GDP growth above and beyond that explainable
as  result of government outlays.
Barro partly
defends by saying that government <i>transfer</i> payments were <i>not</i> 
held constant.
But, assuming Barro has
idea that transfers aim toward <i>equalizing</i> wealth,
he is exactly <i>wrong</i> about its economic effect: 
the <a href="RVPapers.html">Deininger-Squires 1998 World Bank cross-country
study</a>
found that greater initial inequality is strongly <i>negatively</i> correlated
to future economic growth!
</p>

<p>
<small>
In other words, the "trickle down theory" often associated with Ronald Reagan
is wrong.
According to
George R. G. Clarke:
More Evidence on Income Distribution and Growth,
J. Development Economics 47,2 (Aug. 1995) 403-427,
"This conclusion is robust across different inequality measures,
and to many different specifications of the growth regression.
Furthermore, inequality appears to have a negative effect on
<i>both</i> democracies and non-democracies.
Interaction terms between inequality and regime type, when included in the
base regression, do not affect the sign or significance of [this]."
So this seems to settle the matter. (However, to <i>completely</i> clarify matters,
it would be good to put transfer payments into Barro's fit also, to see what happens.
And two other good predictors to try inserting would be a country's winter temperature
and the "centralization fraction" of its government 
[See A.Lijphart: <i>Democracies</i> 1984 table 10.2 page 178].)
</small>
</p>

<p>
<b>Two other possible explanatory hypotheses:</b> 
(more supported than Barro's):
<ol type="a">
<li> 
More democracy &rArr; dumb people make more dumb decisions &rArr; worse economic growth.
</li> 
<li> 
Even smart people make dumb decisions if the "decision-making algorithm" is "a poor
voting system."  If so, then replacing voting system with better one, e.g.
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, would yield
big  economic growth win, and that peak &amp; downturn
might be avoidable &ndash; the curve instead would just keep going up!
</li> 
</ol>
Which?  (Or both?)
If b &rArr; economic growth win attainable by switch to
Range or other better Voting 
appears <i>greater than attainable by altering any other factor</i> identified by Barro
(also seems much <i>easier</i> to change  voting system than to alter
any of those other factors).

</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's also <b>psychological reasons</b>,
<b>tactical reasons</b>,  and <b>"secondary effects"...</b>
</p>
<p>
Let's look into all these in a little more depth...
</p>

<hr>

<H2> Some theorems saying range voting reacts <i>mildly</i> to <i>strategic</i> voting </H2>

<p><b>Avoids favorite betrayal:</b>
In range voting, there is never a strategic reason to give your favorite a non-top score.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where favorite-betrayal often advisable.)
</p>

<p><b>Semi-honesty:</b>
In range voting, if you know all other votes (or in a &le;3-candidate election
even if you have only partial knowledge of the other votes), 
then there is always a strategically-optimal
"semi-honest" threshold-style vote, where create a "threshold" <font color="red">T</font> and
give all candidates better than <font color="red">T</font> score=99, all others score=0.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where it can happen
that every honest &amp; semi-honest vote is non-strategic.)
</p>

<p><b>Pleasant surprise theorem:</b>
Suppose each voter chooses <font color="red">T</font>=their expectation of the value of the winner.
Then: the range-winner will maximize the number of voters who are "pleasantly surprised"
(result exceeds expectations).   That's an optimality property related to,
but not identical to, minimizing Bayesian regret.
</p>

<p><b>Range&rArr;Condorcet theorem:</b>
Suppose each chooses <font color="red">T</font> 
somewhere between candidates C and A, where C and A are viewed
as the two most likely to win.  If one of C or A is an honest-voter Condorcet
winner, then he will also be the range-winner.  (Suggests that in practice,
Condorcet cannot have much advantage over range.)
</p>

<hr>


<H2>  Voter Honesty (or lack thereof) </H2>

<ul>
<li>
&asymp;90% of people saying they'd vote Nader in 2000 voted for somebody else. 
[<a href="http://www.umich.edu/~nes">NES</a> data.]
</li>
<li>
1950 Gallup poll: 38% of British voters wanted to vote Liberal but only 9% did.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?  Strategy.  Don't want to "waste vote."  (&rArr; all previous BR studies, with only
"honest voters," are of little interest.  Also all previous left out RV.)

N>G>B voters <a href="AlteredExagg.html">insincerely switch</a>

<p>
This favorite-betrayal example very important because, once voters understand 
exaggerating their stances on the apparent-frontrunners can be necessary to
prevent "greater evil"s victory, strategic voting is guaranteed, often causing
"third parties" to tend to die out (since the strategic voters won't
"waste their vote" on honest-favorite third-party candidates like N whom they perceive as
having "no chance of winning").

Condorcet: <b>A</b> should win.
(A also wins under <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting method.)
Borda: no, <b>B</b> should win!
Who really should win?  Good question.
</p>
<p>
How would range voting handle this?
RV allows voters to say <i>how much</I> they
prefer B over A (or whoever).  <i>Quantitatively</i>.
Really, Borda or Condorcet are <i>both</i> right  &ndash; but  depending
on intensity-of-preference information  unavailable to their voting methods,
but available to range voting.  So this example illustrates an advantage of range voting
over both previous voting systems.

Cloning the Bores &rArr; huge advantage!   Boring party can just arrange for mucho
Bores to enter the race &amp; totally Boring!
Of course,  Mushites could try to defeat that by intentionally lying in their
votes by ranking 
Bores in  opposite of true order, to try to cancel out
the Borites and make Mush win.  
But this strategy causes them to be massively dishonest in
their votes and risk not only a Bore-victory, but in fact a victory
by the <i>worst</i> of the Bores!  (Which would in fact happen if the Borons
<i>counter</i>strategized by <i>also</i> being dishonest in their Bore-orderings!)

<b>II.</b>
In this 24-voter IRV election, <b>A wins</b> after C is dropped.
But now suppose every voter <i>reverses</i> his preference order (now
attempting to choose worst rather than best).
In that case  A <i>still</i> wins after B is eliminated.
I.e. <i>IRV contradicts itself</i>; IRV's unambiguously
"best" candidate A is here
the same as its "worst"!  
<p>
<p>
Also illustrates bizarre kind of strategic voting:  Suppose
3 of the B>C>A voters reverse their votes to A>C>B (or alter them to A>B>C; that also works).
Then B is eliminated whereupon C wins 13-to-11 over A.
The <i>raising</i> of A from bottom-to-top in their vote caused A to <i>lose</i> &ndash;
and voting maximally dishonestly as though they were suicidally
trying to elect the <i>worst</i>
candidate, was actually <i>optimal strategy</i>!
</p>
<p>
Also illustrates "no show paradox":
If those three B>C>A voters had simply <i>refused to vote</i>,
then C would have won (an improvement in their view).   
Different way of saying the same thing:
these three voters' decision to cast an honest A-last vote
caused A to win.

<H2>  "Secondary effects" </H2>

<p>
"Primary" effect (reckoned using Bayesian regret): 
just who wins the election &amp; how
much utility that is.   "Secondary" effects exert themselves over historical
time in sequence of many elections.  When these also reckoned, RV looks even better...
</p>

<p>
<b>2-party <a href="Duverger.html">domination</a>:</b>  
In systems where "favorite betrayal" common enough,
"2-party domination" happens (third parties die out).   
2PD quickly became <a href="Strangle.html">massive</a> (&gt;99.5%)
in the USA (plurality voting) since "idiotic to waste vote by voting Nader."
2PD also experimentally has always happened under IRV, despite moronic propaganda
(<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>,
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a>,
<a href="FijiPol.html">Fiji</a>).
2PD has <i>not</i> happened under plur+top-2-runoff.  
("<a href="DuvTrans.html">Duverger's laws</a>.")
2PD <i>might</i> happen under Condorcet systems.
</p>

<p><b>Consequent diminution of voter choice:</b>
Bush &amp; Kerry: <i>pro</i>, versus <i>all</i> third-party canddts <i>against</i>:
PATRIOT act, WTO, NAFTA, "war on drugs," Iraq war, subsidy-laden "farm bill,"
(tax cuts leading to) huge budget deficit.   
</p>

<p>
<b><i>One</i>-party domination:</b>
98% <a href="OneParty.html">predictability</a>
in contemporary USA.
(One reason is gerrymandering... by which one party can stay permanently in power
even if only 25+&epsilon;% support.)
</p>

<p><b><a href="RL2parties.html#cash">Cash</a>:</b>
is extremely important in plurality voting, but perceived to be less so in other systems
e.g. plur+top-2-runoff.  Why?  Need to demonstrate you are one of the top-2 "frontrunners,"
i.e. create illusion of winnability, otherwise not worth wasting vote on you.
That's expensive.  (Educating about issues: cheap.)
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="Media.html">Media</a>:</b>
Pays no attention to third-party views (no motivation; they're not news).
Media "lapdogs" unquestioningly accept politicians' BS without much
critical examination  (because with 2-party and 1-party domination, politicians
are in monopoly  position to cut off media lifeblood; with multiparties no
such info monopoly)
</p>

<p>
<b>Lack of congressional oversight:</b>
For most of about 8 years, Democrats in Congress haven't been able to subpoena anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rubberstamped agency heads &amp; judge appointments:</b>
In votes for court of 
appeals nominees, Republican Senators during the Bush administration (during
majority control) produced 2703 votes for the nominee as opposed to only a <i>single</i>
"no" vote (cast by Trent Lott against judge Roger Gregory, the
first Black ever appointed to this position).
</p>
<img src="HurricaneMoney.png" alt="Hurricane protection money budget figures" align="right">
<p>
Bush appointed Joseph Allbaugh as head of FEMA in 2001, although Allbaugh had no 
expertise or experience handling emergencies, but rather had been
then-Texas-Governor Bush's chief of staff &amp; campaign manager for 
Bush-Cheney nationwide campaign. 
(Allbaugh had B.S. in political science from Oklahoma State University.) 
In 2003, Allbaugh replaced by Michael D. Brown &ndash;
Former estate and family lawyer and bar examiner. 
<small>
The Boston Herald reports that Brown was "fired from his last private-sector job, overseeing horse shows... after a spate of lawsuits over alleged supervision failures... `He was asked to resign,' Bill Pennington, president of the IAHA at the time, confirmed last night." 
</small>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pork &amp; earmark game-playing:</b>
<p>
<b>FEMA</b> (Federal Emergency Management Agency),
in  report well before both Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 attack, summarized top
3 threats to the USA as a terrorist attack on New York, major earthquake in 
San Francisco and hurricane strike on New Orleans. 
But Bush and Congress by bipartisan budget vote
turned down
Louisiana's requests for mere tens of <i>millions</i>
per year to protect
New Orleans.  
New Orleans contained 
urban &amp; poor people, many blacks, hence a high% Democrat voters;
Louisiana had democrat senator,
&amp; <b>starting in 2004, a democrat governor</b>.
</p>

<p>
Compare with:
$28 <i>billion</i> embassy (constructing in Iraq);
$231 million for Alaska bridge between 
Gravina Island (population&lt;50) &amp;
Ketchikan (pop. 8,000);
Wyoming $31 million in anti-terrorism funding in 2003 (more per capita than any state).

<p>
RV has some further advantages perhaps not mathematically explainable, but which instead are
<i>experimental</i> facts that are consequences of human psychology:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Altruism:</b>
Range Voters exhibit unstrategic honesty to far greater degree than plurality voters.
(76% of RV ballots manifestly unstrategic...  versus: 90% of the time US <i>plurality</i> voters 
can choose between strategic V honest, they pick strategic.)
</li><li>
<b>Nursery effect</b> follows: third parties should favor RV (unless death wish)
</li>
<a name="spoilrates"></a>
<li>
Range (and approval) voters have <b>low</b> ballot-invalidating <b>error rates</b>, 
while IRV voters
have high rates.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
Plurality: 1.0-3.1% spoiled (6 countries).  IRV: 3.4-6.2% spoiled (Australia 8 territories).
</td></tr></table>
Also &ge;7X increase IRV vs plurality <a href="SPRates.html">spoilage</a> rate in SF.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
French 2002 approval study: 2.0% spoilage for official plurality votes, 0.3% for
approval exit-poll votes.
</td></tr></table>
Range: 0.026% spoilage rate (per <i>candidate</i>) observed in our exit poll; 99.5% confidence
that range rate per canddt is at least twice as small as USA's plurality error rate of 1.8%.
Similar results in <a href="OrsayTable.html">French study</a>.
One reason:
RV &amp; AV: every way to fill in scores is legal.  IRV &amp; plurality: not so.
Another(?): range &amp; approval voters repeatedly do the same operation many times in each race,
causing them to be more careful and inherently self-checking.  (Plurality: do it only once.)

<H2>  Tactical reasons to prefer Range Voting </H2>

<p>
<b>1.</b> Range Voting works, simply, on every (plurality) voting machine!
</p><p>
Mathematically: &exist; <a href="kokidea.txt">transformation</a>
of one <i>C</i>-candidate (0-9 plus X) range voting election
to 11<i>C</i> artificial "plurality elections."  In some cases, this is easy and convenient from
the viewpoint of voters (optical scan machines) in others it is less convenient (which is
why we would prefer to have purpose-designed range-voting machines) &ndash; but it
always works, easing transition worries greatly.
</p>
<b>Demo:</b>
</P>
<p>
<small>
Award each candidate a <i>numerical score</i> from 0 to 9.
Advise giving your favorite candidate 9 and the worst one 0.
If you intentionally wish to express <i>no opinion</i> about that candidate, then please 
<i>do not select any score</i> for him &ndash; equivalently leave the default
"X" choice selected;
only numerical scores will be incorporated into the averaging.

</P>
<H2>  Iowa 2008 Pres-Primary Caucuses &ndash; perfect stage for range voting </H2>
<H3>  Tactics: All major power groups <i>want</i> RV in Iowa  (unlike usual) </H3>

<ol>
<li>  Iowa caucuses get tremendous media attention, have tremendous
impact despite small Iowa population. 
Mucho <i>publicity</i> for range voting.
</li>

<li>  Appears can change the rules without altering state or federal
law, only Dem. &amp; Repub. party internal procedures, central committee.
<i>Easier target.</i>
</li>
<li>  Iowa caucuses use pen &amp; paper ballots &amp; manual totaling (hand calculators
or adding machines).
Hence can easily institute single-digit range voting &ndash; essentially 
<i>no complexity penalty</i>
versus approval &amp; plurality.
</li>

<li> Both the Dems &amp; Repubs (at all levels: rank-and-file members countrywide
and Iowa-wide, Iowa state party leaders, national party leaders), 
are <i>motivated</i> to <i>want</i> to use
range so they can get a <a href="PlurPrim.html">better presidential nominee</a>,
and seem in favor of reform, and get free publicity;  Iowans may also
be in favor of change since many may believe Kerry (or Bush) was a mistake by them.
</li>
<li>  Because expect 10 Dem &amp; 10 Repub candidates, range voting will
have maximized <i>quality advantage</i> versus
plurality &amp; approval.  <a href="RandElect.html#RangePlur">Computer sims</a>:

Third parties want range voting and their supporters constitute at least 1% and 
arguably as much as 40% of society.  They could swing the election.  It is
worth catering to their desires, especially when it also benefits everybody
else including the major parties and all USA-wide.
</li>
<li>  
Leads to voter education, reform, free good publicity beneficial for all involved,
and better US presidential candidates.

<p>Honeybee (<i>Apis Mellifera</i>) swarms
(each spring) and the 3mm-long eusocial ant 
<i>Leptothorax Albipennis</i> (after nest destruction)
both use range voting to decide on the location of their new nest.
</p>

<p><b>Problems bees face:</b>
Tiny brains.  Can they do "addition," "division," and "averaging"?
If so, can they communicate results reliably?  What if some bees mentally defective
or miscommunicate?  How to reach a swarm-wide consensus?  How to do it quickly?
"Robust log-time parallel algorithm"...
</p>

<p><b>How bees do it:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Scouting.  (Only 5%=scouts, rest sit there.)
</li><li>
Dances.  Better nest sites get longer, more vigorous dances (greater "range vote scores").
</li><li>
More (&amp; hotter)
dancers at any given time &rArr; more probability of recruiting new scout &rArr;
</li><li>
Higher "exponential growth rate" for nest sites with greater range votes.
</li><li>
Eventually the faction advocating the site with greatest average score, dominates
population (even if initially small; higher exponential wins out over constant factor).
</li><li>
"Quorum rule" that it ain't over until enough votes are in.
</li></ol>
</p>

<p><b>How good are they?</b>
Swarm: 2000-20000 bees.
&ge;10<sup>15</sup> elections so far.
Usually find &asymp;20 different housing options within about 100 km<sup>2</sup>,
and <b>&asymp;90%</b> of the time, bee swarm succeeds in selecting (what
appears to entomologists to be)  best one.
</p>
<p>
Compare plurality-using humans:
Computer sims &rArr; 1283 honest plurality-voters, given 10 choices
(each voter regards each choice as worth  standard-normal-random-number 
"dollar amount," all randoms generated independently before  experiment begins) 
succeed in choosing the best (maximum &sum; dollars) <b>32%</b> of the time. 
</p>
<p>
Random guess: (<b>10%</b>), 
</p>
<p>
Sim-humans employing "approval voting" 
(approving choices with value greater than midway between the best &amp; worst available) 
then <b>54%</b>.
</p>
<p>
Sim-humans employing "range voting" 
(scoring best choice 99, worst 0, rest linearly interpolated) then <b>79%</b>...
at least <i>approaching</i> bee-quality.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ants:</b>
The most successful macroscopic land animals (15-20% of all land animal biomass?!).

<H2>  Splitline algorithm to get rid of gerrymandering </H2>

<p>
<a href="GerryExamples.html" target="_blank">Shortest splitline
algorithm</a> eliminates gerrymandering. Basically: find
shortest line splitting state into two parts with right population ratios, 
then continue recursively. 
This produces better district maps for less cost than present methods and is completely unbiased.
Blue map shows Massachusetts as gerrymandered to have 100%
Democratic congressmen,
versus districts that would have been produced by splitline.
