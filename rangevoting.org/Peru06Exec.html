<H2>  Peru 2006 election (Executive summary) </H2>

<p>
The voters preferred Lourdes Flores over Humala
by 55-45 majority, and 
preferred Lourdes Flores over Garcia
by 58-42 majority.
But 
plurality with top-two runoff eliminated
Lourdes Flores in the first round and then gave the win to Garcia.
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> ("Instant Runoff") presumably would have done the same bad thing.
</p>
<p>
This election also exhibited "nonmonotonicity."
