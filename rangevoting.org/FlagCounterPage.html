Only visits to the <a href="RangeVoting.html">CRV <b>front</B> page</a>
(and, unfortunately,
this page too, but hardly anybody knows about this page and the people who do were probably 
already counted from the front page and hence do not get re-counted) 
count here.  (Most non-front pages are also counted, but that's seperate.)

Only (14&plusmn;4)% of visitors to website staying longer than 5 minutes.
About 7% are return visitors versus 93% first-time.
For a while it looked like everyone was going to move 
to hi-res screens, but now with rise of "android" &amp; mobile devices, many back to 
low-res (800&times;600 or less).

177 countries, 71% from USA.
Average of 38 visitors to front page per day (versus 380 for whole site).
Germany, France, Netherlands, and Brazil are the biggest non-English speaking countries
(5.7% combined).
On average visitor examines 1.93 pages.
Only 2.7% of site visitors return.
Visitation is very "spiky" with the biggest-visit day each year being &gt;20&times; average.
Only (19&plusmn;7)% of visitors to website stay longer than 5 minutes.
58% come to the site from google, 9% from facebook, 7% from reddit, rest from random
blogs and unknown places.  
Other search engines besides google (yahoo, bing) giving us almost nothing.
(30&plusmn;8)% of access is now from mobile devices like iPhones with low-res screens.

[<i>Warning</i>: I suspect some data from this period may be atypical and
about twice normal since this date is soon
before USA election to be held 8 Nov.  
But I'm giving the data for what it is worth. <i>Latwr note</i>: still looks valid as of 3 December.]
192 countries, 71% from USA.
Average of 86 unique visitors to front page per day (versus 600 for whole site).
Germany, France, Brazil, Italy, Netherlands, and China
are the biggest non-English speaking countries
(7.0% combined).
Get about 600 unique visitors per day to the site, and 2500 per week,
11K per month, 150K per year. Note weekly total is <i>less</i> than 7&times;daily,
monthly total is <i>less</i> than 30.4&times;daily, etc due to return visiting,
e.g. on new day.
Indeed, on a typical day with 600 unique visitors, we get 4800 visits in all,
i.e. mean visitor examines 8 pages (or could be 8 re-accesses of same page).
But only (16&plusmn;3)% of visits exceed 5 minutes and (25&plusmn;3)% exceed 30 seconds.
About (35&plusmn;10)% of visitors use low-res screens (less than 414 pixels horizontally)
e.g. mobile phones.
Top referrers include google, bing, reddit, facebook, yahoo, ask.com
in roughly descending order, as well as random blogs and web pages and the press.

where it suggests: trying to boost traffic from facebook, pinterest, twitter;
improve experience for small-screen (mobile phone) viewers; increase page views per

<h3> Comparisons versus other forms of education, books, marketing, etc. </h3>
<p>
The total number of distinct visitors
to the rangevoting.org web site over the 5-year span starting Nov. 2009,
was about 700K.
If you only
count those whose visit lasted at least 5 minutes, then about 130K;
if you only count visits longer than 20 minutes, then somewhere between 10K and 50K 
(sorry, large statistical error bar on long visits).
</p><p>
That's been a highly successful feat of education, far greater than,
say, the number
of students that any conventional school-teacher has ever had, and comparable
to a quite high-selling book in terms of "#copies sold."  (More on that below.)
However, compared to what is <i>necessary</i>, and in terms of our success 
at getting <i>laws changed</i>, this effort has (up to year 2014) been a failure.
</p><p>
As of year <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bj-gallagher/book-publishing_b_1394159.html">2012</a>
the average U.S. nonfiction book is selling less than 250 copies
per year and less than 3000 copies over its lifetime.
(Incidental quote from that article:
"Achieving publishing success is 5% writing a good book and 95% marketing."  Which
agrees with my experience with 
the  "spiky" nature of readership of this web site; on days with good "marketing"
where there was some kind of "buzz" that day that attracted visitors, we got hugely more than the average
number.)
Only 6.2% of business books released in 2009 sold more than 5000
copies, according to an analysis by the Codex Group 
(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/books/31covers.html?_r=0">New York Times 31 March 2010</a>).
During a 7-year span ending 2011, the average book from authors represented
by the <a href="http://www.stevelaube.com/more-about-book-sales/">Steve Laube agency</a>
(both fiction and nonfiction, I think mostly the former) sold 20K copies.
At any time as of year 2012, about 300K books are available for purchase on the market, albeit
the vast majority of these are not available on your local bookstore's shelves.
</p><p>
So, apparently this web site during 2009-2014 was around 6&times; more popular than an average book
from the Laube agency, 40&times; more popular than an average nonfiction
book, and 25&times; more popular than the 94th percentile best selling among business books.
But its popularity was tiny compared to say,
<i>The Total Woman</i> by Marabel Morgan, the highest-selling nonfiction book of 1974,
which sold 10M copies.  Calling that book "nonfiction" is rather generous, though.  It's a generic
advice book about religion, sex, lifestyle.  
If you restrict attention to nonfiction books
which actually contain some quality, intellectual depth, and originality, then it is hard
to find out what their sales are... but...
Apparently the three highest selling books Harvard University Press ever 
produced were
<i>Dinosaurs in a Haystack: Reflections on Natural History</i> by Stephen Jay Gould,
<i>A Secular Age</i> by Charles Taylor,
and <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>
by Thomas Piketty, selling respectively 60K, 60K, and about 100K copies.
Those three seem to be the closest comparisons available in the book world 
to the present website,
and indeed this website has a comparable number of readers to each of those.
Thus this website is indeed reaching about the most readers it could possibly hope to reach 
if those three books were viewed as high water marks.
However, 
</p><ol><li>
Probably greater readership is achievable for web sites than for (comparable content) books.
</li><li>
Perhaps a different style of web site, less intellectual and, e.g, more
involving women clad in Saran Wrap (one ploy recommended in <i>The Total Woman</i>)
could attain 100&times; greater readership.
</li></ol>
