<H2> Asset voting  for W-winner elections (executive summary) </h2>

<p>
<b>Asset Voting</b> is a simple <i>multi</i>winner voting system.
Suppose we're talking about an election with W winners:
<ol>
<li>
Voters provide scores to every candidate.  
The scores are non-negative numbers that add up to 
100.  In Simmons' simpler version, your vote is just "name one candidate"
(who gets 100 from you, the others get zero).
</li><li>
A candidate's score-total then is the amount of an "asset" he then "owns."
Candidates then negotiate, transferring some or all of their assets to each other.
</li><li>
After negotiations end, the W most asset-rich candidates  are the W winners.
</li><li>
(Optional) we could have "weighted congressmen" where 
each has a number of votes in congress proportional to
his assets when elected.   This would cause even-finer "proportionality."
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Asset is extremely simple, it is <a href="PropRep.html">proportional</a>,
and it tends to encourage voters to vote honestly for their favorites and not strategically
for their non-favorites.
