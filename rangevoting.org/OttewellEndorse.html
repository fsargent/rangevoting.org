<H3> Endorsement of Range Voting by Guy Ottewell </H3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.universalworkshop.com">Guy Ottewell</a>
is a writer and painter.  He has also been a publisher, an inventor, and an astronomer,
and he sells an annual 
"<a href="http://www.universalworkshop.com/AC.htm">astronomical calendar</a>."
For our purposes, what is important is that Ottewell in 1968 appears to have been the first
inventor of <a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval Voting</a>, a revolutionary voting system.
Approval voting was invented by at least seven people independently during
the late 1960s and early 1970s; its history was discussed by 
<a href="RVPapers.html">Brams and Fishburn in their book <i>Approval Voting</i></a>
and later by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">Wikipedia</a>,
which credited Ottewell as the first inventor, and finally and most comprehensively
by Ottewell himself in
a historical postscript updating his 
<a href="http://www.universalworkshop.com/ARVOfull.htm">pamphlet</a>.
Better-known (within the academic
political science community, at least), but later, inventors
include S.J.Brams, P.Fishburn, and R.J.Weber.
</p>

<p>
Our opinion, however, is that range voting is a further advance, and that both of the
key ideas in <a href="RangeVoting.html">our range voting method</a> that go beyond approval 
voting &ndash; namely 
<ol>
<li>
allowing numerical ratings of each candidate,
and 
</li>
<li>
allowing "intentional blank" scores which do not affect a candidate's rating,
</li>
</ol>
constitute improvements.  Ottewell told us he agrees with both (1) and (2) and gave us
the following <i>written endorsement</i>:

<p>
I naturally still feel an attachment for Approval Voting as my brainchild (see my pamphlet 
"<a href="http://www.universalworkshop.com/pages/ArithmeticOfVoting.htm">The Arithmetic of Voting</a>,"
I didn't invent the term, but I had conceived the idea pretty early).  It would be a radical improvement over 
the established methods; that is painfully clear to me at almost every election.  But I can see that
Range Voting takes the same basic idea and improves it, into something that would be history's 
first thoroughly accurate and fair way of measuring an electorate's wishes.
</p>

<p>
The cost in increased complication is minimal compared with that of many other systems seriously 
proposed, such as the "single transferable vote," 
IRV, Condorcet, and Borda. 
The key innovations are the graded ratings of candidates (instead of a mere "yes" or "no" to each of 
them), and the allowing of "blank" votes for candidates we are neither for nor against.  
It may be little exaggeration to say that this last will be to voting as the invention of the zero was 
to mathematics!
</p>

<p>
There are few ways we as individuals can work effectively against the widespread evils of the modern
world.  Helping to bring about really sound elections could be the most powerful.
