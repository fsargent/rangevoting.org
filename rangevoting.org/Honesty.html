<H2> Range voting "Encourages honesty"? </H2>

<p>
(<a href="HonestyExec.html">Executive summary</a>)
</p>

<p>
In almost all voting systems, including
range voting, voters
can gain "strategical advantages" by being dishonest in their vote.
</p>

<p>
For example in the plurality system used in the 2000 USA presidential
election, voters who thought Nader was best were urged not to be strategically
stupid and instead to vote (dishonestly) for either Gore or Bush.
</p>

<p>
Polls showed that about 90% of the voters who thought
Nader was best in fact <i>did</i> vote
for somebody else.  I.e. they agreed with that strategy argument!
Nevertheless, about 10% of Nader-wanting voters wanted him so strongly they
felt compelled to actually be honest and say so in their vote.
They paid a big price for that honesty!  A lot more among the 97488
Nader voters in the critical state of Florida,
favored Gore than favored Bush.  But Bush won Florida, and hence the whole USA,
by an official margin of 537 votes.  If even 5% of those 97488
Nader voters had
decided to strategically lie instead of be honest, that would have easily tipped
the election to Gore and (most) of them would have ended up a lot happier!

</p>

<p>
With plurality voting you often feel forced to either be a <i>liar</i>, or a <i>fool!</i>
That's a heck of a choice!
</p>

<p>
Range voting, while not perfect in this respect, is comparatively good.
</p>

<p>
To provide perspective, Allan Gibbard showed 
a famous <b>impossibility theorem</b> saying
that <i>no</i> single winner
voting system exists that
<ol>
<li>
handles 3-candidate elections
</li>
<li>
defines a "vote" to be a  rank-ordering of the candidates,
</li>
<li>
has the property that an honest vote is always a strategically-best vote,
i.e. smart voters never feel the urge to lie.
</li>
</ol>
In other words: for every possible voting system based on rank-orderings
as votes, there exists a 3-candidate election in which it pays for you
to lie in your vote.
So there is no perfect voting system in this respect; the <i>best we can hope for</i>
is to reduce the degree of imperfection.
</p>

<p>
(See
paper #79 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>
for an online survey paper on such impossibility theorems, which states, proves, and/or
cites these theorems and references the original papers by Gibbard & co.)
</p>

<p>
Let us discuss some ways Range Voting fulfills that hope.
</p>

<p>
Range voting still "encourages honesty"
in a somewhat weaker than absolute sense.
(I use the word "encourage" in a civilian rather than military manner!)
</p>

<p>
<b>Honesty Theorem.</b>
In a 3-candidate range election, nobody can ever gain strategic advantage
by dishonestly range-voting as though Alice&gt;Bob, if their honest
opinion is Bob&gt;Alice.  
</p>

This is not a state of perfection.  But it is still good and useful, and it is better than

<p>
<b>Contrasting Theorem (follows from Gibbard).</b>
In a 3-candidate election conducted using <i>any method whatever</i> whose
<a href="MeaningOfVote.html">votes</a> are (unlike in range voting)
<i>rank-orderings</i> of the candidates,
there is always some election scenario in which a voter can obtain 
a better
election result 
(from his point of view)
by dishonestly voting as though Alice&gt;Bob, even if his honest
opinion is Bob&gt;Alice.  
</p>

<p>
So range voting <i>encourages honesty better</i>
than <i>every</i> rank-ordering-based voting system, 
including Borda, IRV, and Condorcet methods.
</p>

<H3> Experimental Fact: Range voting encourages voter honesty </H3>

<p> 
The above arguments have been purely <i>mathematical</i>.  But what also matters is
<i>psychological</i> and experimental, i.e, how actual human voters behave.
</p>

<p>
Some critics told me they thought that, in practice, range voters will "strategically"
always max-out or min-out every candidate's score to 99 or 0.
This exaggeration would effectively convert
range voting into <a href="rangeVapp.html">approval voting</a>.
(And that would not be so bad, since approval voting is still a pretty good voting system.)
</p>

<p>
But, experimentally, that just does not happen:
Most range voters do <i>not</i> vote approval style.
Most of them choose to be honest (or at least partially honest)
rather than strategically optimal.  
Specifically, in our range and
approval voting
exit-poll study of random voters in the 2004 US presidential election
(<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">#82 here</a>)
we found that
the percentage of range voters who vote approval-style 
(with optional blanks) is 26% as a central estimate (and &le;33%
with confidence 90%).
In other words:  
</p>
<blockquote>
Experimental fact: At least 74% of range voters vote "honestly" or at least partially so.
</blockquote>

<p>
This fact stands in gigantic contrast to the fact (top of this page) that
about &gt;90% 
of Nader-favoring
plurality voters vote dishonestly!
It also  has very major (also experimentally verified) consequences:  the 
&quot;<a href="NurseryEffect.html">nursery effect</a>&quot;
is one of them.
This giant effect may cause third parties never to
be able to
survive past infancy under approval voting, but to be able to with range voting.
Don't you prefer the latter?
