<p>
<b>Monotonicity</b> is the property of a voting system that both
<ol type="I">
<li>
If somebody increases their vote for candidate C (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not worsen C's chances of winning the election.
</li><li>
If somebody decreases their vote for candidate B (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not improve B's chances of winning the election.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
One can also consider <i>sets</i> of voters increasing their vote for C in (I), 
causing (if monotonicity fails) C to stop winning, etc.  
We can also, even <b>more generally</b>,
still, ask for 
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>
If some set of voters increase their votes for candidate C and
either leave the rest of their vote unchanged, or decrease their
votes for C-rivals, then:
that should not worsen C's chances of winning the election.
</li><li>
If some set of voters decrease their vote for candidate B 
(and either leave the rest of their vote unchanged, or
increase their votes for B-rivals), then:
that should not improve B's chances of winning the election.
</li>

The Mathematics of Voting and Elections -- a hands-on approach

p49:
6: G>M>D>S
5: M>G>D>S
4: D>S>M>G
2: S>D>G>M
p50:
G wins, but if the last 2 voters swap G & D ("improving" G) then
M wins.  This illustrates non-monotonicity of IRV.
p51:
1: A>B>C
2: B>A>C
2: C>A>B
With IRV B wins, but A is a beats-all winner.  Illustrates failure
for IRV of Condorcet criterion (thwarted-majority failure).
p3:
Definition 1.8:
A voting system is said to be monotone if it is impossible for a winning candidate
to become a losing candidate  by gaining votes (while not losing any others)
or for a losing candidate to become a winning candidate by losing votes 
(while not gaining any others).

<p>
Unfortunately,
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a> (IRV) is not monotonic;
indeed, it fails  <i>both</i> criteria.   Two real-world IRV elections (both held in 2009)
illustrating this were
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington VT (USA)</a>
and
<a href="Frome2009.html">Frome Australia</a>.

<h3> Examples demonstrating nonmonotonicity of IRV </h3>

<b>Criterion I fails:</b>
when two voters change their vote to C, that stops
C from winning.   
</p><p><b>Details:</b>
<b>C</b> wins this 17-voter IRV election
(B is eliminated and 1 more of his 5 votes transfer to C than to A, causing
C to win 9:8 over A).
But after the two A>C>B voters
instead give their vote to C, then <b>B</b> wins.  
(In the new election, A is eliminated
and his 4 votes transfer to B, causing
B to win 9:8 over C.)
</p>
<p>
<b>This occurred</b> in the 
<a href="LizVwiz.html">Louisiana 1991 governor election</a>,
which was a (non-instant) runoff election with 12 candidates but only the top 3 got
over 410,000 votes each; the remaining 9 candidates each got under 83,000 individually and
under 125,000 in the aggregate.
It also occurred in 
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington Vermont 2009</a> (a genuine IRV election
for which we have full set of ballots) and
<a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006</a> (a top-2 runoff election in which the 
top 3 candidates got 79% of the votes).

The two particular election examples above

<p>
There is one saving grace for IRV, though:
it is not possible for <i>both</i> type-I and type-II failure to occur in the same election
at the same time in the same way.
That is, there is no IRV election in which X, by giving away some
votes to the current IRV-winner W, can cause X to win  and W to stop winning.
This <i>disjointness</i> is easy to see and will implicitly underlie our probability
calculations below.
</p>


<h3> How often do such monotonicity failures happen in instant runoff elections? </h3>

<p>
For now, let's consider only 3-candidate IRV elections.  (We shall consider
IRV elections with more than 3 candidates <a href="#manycand">later</a>; in them
monotonicity failures presumably are more frequent.  
If there are two or fewer candidates, failure
is impossible.  In the limit of a large number of candidates, we shall see failure 
becomes overwhelmingly likely.)
In the <a href="RandElect.html">&quot;random elections model&quot;</a>
[which has also been called the "Impartial Culture" in the literature,
see, e.g.  Ilia Tsetlin, Michel Regenwetter, Bernard Grofman:
<i>The impartial culture maximizes the probability of majority cycles</i>,
Social Choice and Welfare 21,3 (Dec 2003) 387-398;
William V. Gehrlein:
<i>Weighted scoring rules, the impartial culture condition, and homogeneity</i>,
Quality and Quantity 20,1 (1986) 85-107;
etc.]
monotonicity failures of type (I) occur about once per 45 elections and of type (II)
occur once per 8.2 elections.   In total, monotonicity failure occurs
<b>once every 6.9 elections, i.e. 14.5% of the time.</b>
</p>
<p>
IRV advocates have falsely claimed that non-monotonicity in IRV elections is very rare.
</p>
<small>
<p>
One reason was a published
paper by Crispin Allard in which he made an incorrect calculation of these numbers.
Allard made at least 3 different errors, <i>all</i> of which pushed his number erroneously too small.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Wrongly forgot to multiply by 6; Allard reduced the problem to computing a certain volume, but
there really were 6 copies of that volume because of 6 ways to rename the 3 candidates.
</li><li>
Then when he computed that (6 times too small) volume, he did it wrong, getting a far-smaller number
even than the factor-6 too-small number he should have gotten.
</li><li>
Allard only examined type-II nonmonotonicity and apparently was unaware that type-I also existed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As a result of these errors, Allard got a number about 1000 times smaller than the truth.  His
incorrect paper was 
<a href="http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE5/P1.HTM">
Estimating the Probability of Monotonicity Failure in a UK General Election,</a>
Voting Matters 5 (January 1996).   
</p>
<p>
A second reason was the perception by IRV advocates that if phenomena like non-monotonicity
occurred in an important real election, then the press would shout all about it;
since they were unaware of
the press ever doing that, therefore, it must never occur in real life.
Since we have mentioned very important real-world elections above in which monotonicity (and
other properties too!) failed (and the press, as far as I can tell, never mentioned that even once)
we know that perception was erroneous.   IRV property failure is 
<a href="Aus07.html">quite common</a> in real life &ndash; it occurs at rates comparable to
those predicted by the 
<a href="RandElect.html">random elections</a> and Dirichlet models
&ndash;
despite the lack of mention of that in the press.
</p>
</small>
<h3> How do we know that? </h3>
<p>
It actually is possible to derive exact formulas for these probabilities
using "Schl&auml;fli functions" (see 
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p4">puzzle #4</a>).
But a simpler approach is just to perform "Monte Carlo experiments" where
you simply try lots of random elections to see how often these phenomena occur.
</p>
<p>
See this web page:
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">
/IrvParadoxProbabilities.html</a>
for far more about that.

Here is a simple computer program which does this for type-I nonmonotonicity:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ccffcc"> <tr><td>
<pre>
for NNL from 2 to 5 do
NN := 6*10^NNL;   #NN = no. of experiments to try = 600, 6000, 60000, 600000
FailCt := 0;               #counter initially zero
CAwinsCt := 0;             #this counter also initially zero
for i from 1 to NN do      #perform NN experiments
   #step 1: generate random normal numbers as the 6 kinds of vote count
   ABC := RandomNormal();
   ACB := RandomNormal();
   BAC := RandomNormal();
   BCA := RandomNormal();
   CAB := RandomNormal();
   CBA := RandomNormal();
   if(CAB+CBA > BAC+BCA and       #B elimd in original IRV election
      ABC+ACB > BAC+BCA and       #B elimd in original IRV election
      CAB+CBA+BCA > ABC+ACB+BAC   #C wins original IRV election

      CAwinsCt := CAwinsCt+1;   #to simplify, we only examine elections which "C" won with "A" second

         t+BCA+BAC > CAB+CBA+ACB+ABC-t       #...whereupon B wins the new IRV election
      )</font> then
         FailCt := FailCt+1:   #increment counter since mono-I failure example seen
      fi;
   fi;
od;
print(FailCt, " out of ", CAwinsCt, " type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes");
od;
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Note the correction (in <font color+"red">red<?font>) added March 2009.  The old uncorrected code had
read
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ccffcc"> <tr><td>
<pre>
      if(ABC < BAC+BCA and         #after ACB votes moved from A to C then A elimd...
         ABC < CAB+CBA+ACB and         
         ABC+BCA+BAC > CAB+CBA+ACB       #...whereupon B wins the new IRV election
      ) 
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
This old code underestimated the type-I non-monotonicity probability because it erroneously thought
that it was only worth converting ACB votes to C votes to stop C winning.  In fact, it sometimes also helps
to convert some ABC votes too.
</p><p>
The output of this program (two runs, using any
normal distribution with <i>much larger</i> positive 
mean than its standard deviation) was:
</p>
<table bgcolor="yellow"> <tr><td>
<pre>
   13 out of 92 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
  125 out of 1015 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
 1278 out of 9985 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
12134 out of 100008 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes

    8 out of 89 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
  123 out of 1021 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
 1240 out of 10003 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
12088 out of 99549 type-I mono failures where C won but stops winning if given ACB votes
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Hence we conclude the type-I failure probability for IRV 3-candidate elections is
<blockquote>
(13+125+1278+12134 + 8+123+1240+12088)/(92+1015+9985+100008 + 89+1021+10003+99549)  <br>
= 27009/221762 <br>
= 12.18% 
</blockquote>
which with a generous error bar is (12.2&plusmn;0.1)%, or 1 failure per 8.2 elections.

Here is the analogous program for type-II monotonicity failure; it yields 
(2.312&plusmn;0.001)%
failure rate.

Fortunately
this program seems not to exhibit any error analogous to the one I corrected (March 2009) in the first program.

<h3> A different probabilistic model (Dirichlet) </h3>
<p>
A different probabilistic model
is sometimes proposed in which the 6 vote-numbers
(for the 6 vote types ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA) are to be chosen uniformly in the
5-dimensional simplex 
</p>
<center>
ABC+ACB+BAC+BCA+CAB+CBA=100,
&nbsp;
ABC&ge;0, ACB&ge;0, BAC&ge;0, BCA&ge;0, CAB&ge;0, CBA&ge;0
</center>
<p>
(using 3-letter variable names).
I call this the "Dirichlet model."
If you replace "RandomNormal()" in the above computer programs by 
"RandomExponential()" then you get that effect (as Dirichlet was the first to 
point out).

In the Dirichlet model, for 3-candidate IRV elections 
I found in this way using the <i>uncorrected</I> program that
the probability of type-I monotonicity failure was
(2.2140&plusmn;0.0057)%
which agrees mildly well with
Eivind Stensholt's finding 
[<small><a href="http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE15/P2.HTM">Nonmonotonicity in AV</a>,
Voting Matters 15 (June 2002)</small>]
that "2.17% of the profiles are nonmonotonic."
(<small>
Incidentally, Stensholt perhaps 
erroneously thinks the Dirichlet model is the same as 
the Impartial Culture
model, and erroneously is unaware of type-II failure.
Stensholt did not cite the erroneous Allard paper, 
which if he had seen it would have let
him know about type-II.
</small>)
<i>However, this was wrong!</i>
I thought it was right for several years because of 
the agreement with Stensholt, but then I found a 
paper
by Anthony Quas in which he found a substantially larger number, and soon after I found the error 
(which Stensholt and
I had both made)!  After running the <i>corrected</i> program, I find that
</p>
<blockquote>
The probability of type-I monotonicity failure is
(4.5133&plusmn;0.0008)%.

<p>
This agrees with Quas's <i>exact</i> finding of

It is surprising how greatly the number changes when we change the underlying
probabilistic model in this way: 12.2% in the first model versus only 4.5% in the second.
</p><p>
For type-II monotonicity, while we in our original Impartial Culture model found a 
2.312% monotonicity-failure rate,
--<b>WARNING:</b> I just re-did this with a different Monte Carlo program and found (2.47&plusmn;0.04)%,
usd to be 4.9% but I found the bug in the 4.9 old program now.--
in the Dirichlet model we get
(0.98&plusmn;0.094)%.
A computer program I had written independently years before for the purpose
of correcting Allard's calculation had found
(1.050&plusmn;0.001)%
which agrees fine with, and confirms our present
(0.98&plusmn;0.094)%; 
but unfortunately a later longer run of my present program found
(0.90935&plusmn;0.0001)%.
Allard's incorrect number was 0.025%.

(<small>Actually it ought to be possible in the Dirichlet model to express all these 
probabilities as exact rational numbers
arising from polytope-volume ratios, as opposed to our approximate Monte-Carlo results.

<h3> Still another probabilistic model (1-dimensional "political spectrum") </h3>

<p>
In this model, the N candidates are random-uniform points on the real interval (0,1).
The voters are the uniform distribution on this same interval.  Each voter
orders the candidates best-to-worst in order of increasing <i>distance</i> away from her.
</p>
<p>
Quas says that he has evaluated the probability of a  type-I monotonicity failure
when N=3 in this model and it is exactly 
5/72=6.9444...%.
My computer (Monte-Carlo calculation) finds (6.945&plusmn;0.002)%, confirming Quas.
Quas [after some clarification of his wording] claims the following characterization of 3-candidate
type-I-nonmonotonic IRV elections in the political spectrum model:
</p><blockquote>
There is a non-monotonic [type I] allocation of votes if and
only if the
central candidate gets more than 25% of the vote
and is the first to be eliminated.  
(In this case, the centrist automatically is a 
"<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet winner</a>.")
To see this, note that in this case, the non-winning outer candidate can
give the winner
enough of her vote to have slightly fewer votes than the centrist.
She then is eliminated (now having the fewest votes) and all
her votes transfer to the centrist rather than to the more extreme winner,
allowing the centrist to become the new winner.
</blockquote>
<p>
That was, in fact, exactly what happened in <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a>.
</p><p>
Apparently 3-candidate
type-II-nonmonotonic IRV elections <i>are impossible</I> in this model.
We thank Peter J. Sloan for pointing this out.  
</p><blockquote>
At first, confusedly, I had thought the following
election was non-monotonic [type II].
<!-- if and
only if the IRV winner is also 
the central candidate and also a <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet Winner</a>, but is
<i>not</i> the plurality winner...  and if
the plurality winner can give just enough votes to the other extremist
to cause the centrist to be eliminated, and (if she does so) then wins. -->
<b>[As a picture:</b>
<pre>
      0==============P=======M===============E=1
</pre>
With Instant Runoff Voting (IRV with honest voters), 
E is eliminated, then M wins (versus P).
With <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, P just wins.
<br>
But if some P supporters dishonestly &amp; strategically
give their P votes to E (i.e change their honest votes P&gt;M&gt;E to E&gt;M&gt;P), 
then M is eliminated 
in IRV, whereupon P wins.
That's nonmonotonicity:  fewer P votes cause P to win.<b>]</b>
<br><br>
My computer finds the frequency of occurrence of that kind of failure is 
(2.7778&plusmn;0.0003)%,
which suggests to me that the exact answer is 1/36=2.7777...%.
<i>However</i> this does not meet the technical definition of nonmonotonicity!
This election is an example of <i>strategic ballot reversal</I> which is actually an
even crazier pathology than nonmonotonicity &ndash; maximally lying about your
preferences causes your favorite to win, while honest voting would cause him to lose.
But because the strategists are <i>also</i> being dishonest about M vs E,
this strictly speaking is not "nonmonotonicity" which would involve dishonesty about P only.
</blockquote>
<p>
Peter Sloan's impossibility proof (sketch): 
</p><blockquote>
Let's call the
plurality winner P, the central candidate M, for moderate, and the other
candidate E ("extremist"). The only honest ranking for P's voters allowed under the 1D
political spectrum is P&gt;M&gt;E. 
Now to get a nonmonotonicity type-II paradox, we need some IRV voters to demote P in their
vote, causing P to win.   This will not work if the voters honestly ranked P second or third
since it will not alter the IRV elimination order (except perhaps by eliminating P).
So we must have some P voters switching
from P&gt;M&gt;L to either L&gt;M&gt;P or L&gt;P&gt;M, 
paradoxically causing P to win. That's disallowed since 
this does <i>not</i> leave the relative rankings of the rest (i.e. L and M) 
unchanged. The honest ranking is M&gt;L.
Or finally, 
P&gt;M&gt;L could switch to M&gt;L&gt;P or M&gt;P&gt;L, but
this will not help eliminate M, so it won't work.
Conclusion: type-I non-monotonicity is the only kind allowed in a
three-candidate race under the political spectrum model. Q.E.D.

<h2> Limit of a large number of candidates </h2>

<p>
<b>THEOREM:</b>
Consider N-candidate elections in either
<ol><li>
The <a href="RandElect.html">&quot;random elections model&quot;</a>
(all N! votes equally likely
for each of V voters independently, V&rarr;infinity voters) or
</li><li>
The Dirichlet model (the N! kinds of vote-counts sum to
100% and each are &ge;0, and all such N!-tuples equally likely; Quas calls 
this the "simplex model").
</li></ol>
Then:
the probability that the resulting IRV election is "non-monotonic" in the type-I sense
that switching votes from X to Y (where Y is the IRV winner)
will cause Y to <i>stop</i> winning...
approaches 100% as N becomes large.  
Indeed, the probability of monotonicity is &lt;N<sup>-0.99</sup>
for all sufficiently large N.
Indeed, further, this non-monotonicity almost surely
happens in a huge number of ways simultaneously, i.e. for a huge number
(growing to infinity with N)
of possible replacement-winner candidates X.
</p>
<p>
<b>PROOF SKETCH:</b>
The Dirichlet case of this theorem was proved by Quas 
(in the <a href="assets/documents/QuasPaper23.pdf">article</a> we cited)
as his "theorem 1."  The other case can be proved by a 
parallel argument pointed out by Warren D. Smith in 2009.  
In both cases the argument proceeds roughly
as follows.
</p><p>
Let X be the IRV winner and let Y be preferred over X by a majority (earlier
lemmas by Smith &amp; Quas had shown Y exists with probability&rarr;1
since X is a Condorcet winner with probability&rarr;0 since indeed with probability&rarr;1
no Condorcet Winner
exists; see <a href="PuzzCondProb.html">this puzzle</a>
for the proofs of those lemmas).
Change votes saying "X&gt;Y" to now vote X top
(apparent "improvement" for X).
Now slightly less than half the
ballots say X is top.
But Y is now the IRV winner with probability &rarr;1
since it is ranked top by about 1/N of the voters
(versus about 0.5/N for
everybody else besides X) hence with probability &rarr;1
Y survives to the final IRV round then beats X.
(That, to be solid, really required some estimates, but Quas made them.)
So the "improvement" stopped X winning.
</p>
<p>
<b>More details:</b>
In case 1 (the random election model with V&rarr;&infin;), 
Quas's beta distributions become normal distributions
(correlated ones
with known correlations).
Quas's finding (at top of p.104 in his published article) that 
<nobr>"1-Prob(S<sub>1</sub>&cap;S<sub>2</sub>)=O(n<sup>-0.99</sup>)"</nobr>
is also true in the Random Elections Model: the S<sub>2</sub> part is because of
<a href="PuzzCondProb.html">this puzzle</a> and the S<sub>1</sub> part is trivial since 
in the V&rarr;&infin; limit the variance in each vote-total is <i>zero</i>.
(Incidentally, Quas's argument for S<sub>1</sub> in the Dirichlet model
can be simplified greatly if you know that when N&rarr;&infin;
"almost all of the mass of a regular N-simplex
with unit edges lies in a ball of <nobr>radius&prop;N<sup>-1/2</sup></nobr>.")
The rest of Quas's argument proving his theorem 1 then goes through unaltered 
(as sketched above) to
prove our theorem.
<br>
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
The above theorem and proof (with slight changes) should also work for 
<a href="TidemanRev.html#WBSIRV">WBS-IRV</a> instead of IRV.
For <a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>
it will work <i>provided</i> that once the BTR-IRV process winnows it down to 3 survivors,
either the final two besides X both pairwise-defeat X, or the one that doesn't is pairwise-defeated
by the other one.  Those requirements are not necessarily going to be satisfied
by themselves (although they should be satisfied with a decent probability, say 0.4 or so), 
but can presumably be assured with probability&rarr;1 with some slight
amount of malice aforethought &ndash; the undesired survivors need to be eliminated
in earlier rounds because X gets raised ahead of them in ballots a little more often.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONJECTURE:</b>
In the 1D political spectrum model with N candidates,
the IRV election is non-monotonic (type-I failure) with 
<nobr>probability&ge;1-N<sup>-0.2</sup></nobr>
for all sufficiently large N. 
</p>
<p>
<b>PROOF SKETCH:</b>
We now sketch a proof of Quas's conjecture that the IRV election in
the 1D political spectrum model is nonmonotone with probability&rarr;1
when N=#candidates&rarr;&infin;.
I'm optimistic this proof sketch is, in fact, convertible into a
genuine proof, but (as of 20 March 2009) not yet willing to say I'm sure.
<p></p>
By Black's <a href="BlackSingle.html">singlepeakedness theorem</a>,
a Condorcet winner Y exists and is the candidate located nearest to 1/2.
Let X be the IRV winner.
<p></p>
Let us select a candidate C somewhat nearer to 1/2 than X (but on the same side)
and (say) having a comparatively large initial Voronoi region (i.e. comparatively 
large initial number of top-rank votes).   [We shall need a lemma here that
with probability&gt;1-O(&epsilon;), the distance between X and 1/2 exceeds
&epsilon; and there are numerous candidates located between 1/2 and X.]
<p></p>
Consider a cabal, organized by me, of
voters who raise X in their votes and whose strategic
goal is to create a "buffer zone of safety" for C.  
That is, some of the voters who prefer Z&gt;C&gt;X,
will raise X above Z.
The point is this will cause C's nearby rivals (Z) to be eliminated before
C is eliminated (even though C would normally have been eliminated
because squeezed between two rivals).  In this way it seems to me we
can keep C alive.
In the same way it seems to me we can enhance the survival of other
selected candidates.  The goal is to induce a specific configuration
to approximately appear at each stage of the IRV process,
essentially independently of the initial candidate-locations.
We make IRV winnow the candidates down according to a <i>fixed</I>
time-evolution of the distribution, and with the survivors artificially
uniformly-spaced.  
(The point of uniform spacing is small changes tip the balance;
it gives us more control for fewer "bucks expended.")
Eventually C will become the IRV winner, entirely due to voters raising the old IRV-winner
X in their votes with no other change.
<p></p>
Suppose at the stage where there are M
survivors, all the inter-candidate spacings are uniformly 
const/M but with additive "noise" of
order &plusmn;(N/M)<sup>P</sup>/M
for some constant exponent P with 0&lt;P&lt;1.  
(I think this all will work with P=2/3.)
Then we ought to be able to control
things to eliminate the even-numbered candidates, 
thus getting M/2 survivors also highly-uniformly spaced,
while expending
about const&middot;(N/M)<sup>P</sup> 
vote-alterations (i.e. raising X in that fraction of the votes).
</p><p>
Before starting the above argument,
we let the IRV process run normally (unperturbed) until
it has winnowed down the field to, say,  N<sup>4/5</sup>
survivors, and only <i>after</i> that point try to perturb the process.
IRV naturally, since it eliminates candidates with small Voronoi regions,
will tend to uniformize inter-candidate spacings.  Indeed, believe it can be shown as a lemma
that (with probability&rarr;1 when N&rarr;&infin;), 
after IRV has winnowed down the field to O(N<sup>&kappa;</sup>)
candidates with 0&lt;&kappa;&lt;1, the spacings between the remaining candidates automatically
will be uniform to within a constant factor.
If we select a clump of all the candidates within, say N<sup>-3/5</sup> of the N<sup>1/5</sup>-spaced
lattice points and make sure (via vote manipulation) there is one survivor in each clump then
we get a situation with near-uniform spacing.
</p><p>
After that, the ballot alterations ("raising X above Z") can be done to manipulate each of the IRV
process <i>without affecting</i> preceding stages.  For example, suppose we have a ballot
of the form 
"Q&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;Z&gt;C&gt;...&gt;X&gt;..."
where the Qs stand for candidates eliminated in preceding IRV rounds. We can then raise X above Z
to get
"Q&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;X&gt;Z&gt;C&gt;..."
and all the preceding elimination decisions are <i>unaffected.</i>
(We can pledge never to raise X to top-rank; with probability&rarr;1
that will not sacrifice enough control to
hurt anything.)  This way, if we work out manipulations to make the field after
IRV round #2<sup>57</sup> (say) come out
the way we want, we then can also add manipulations to make field #2<sup>58</sup> 
come out as desired without destroying
the preceding gambits that had manipulated the fields after rounds 2<sup>57</sup>, 2<sup>56</sup>, etc.
</p><p>
The total expenditure (i.e. #ballots altered)
over the whole IRV process is then upperbounded by about
const&middot;&sum;<sub>k</sub>(N/2<sup>k</sup>)<sup>P</sup>
which is a convergent geometric series with 
sum=const&middot;N<sup>P</sup>.
This has been a sketch of (basically) an inductive proof that we can
control the whole history of the 
IRV election (with success probability&rarr;1) 
by raising X within const&middot;N<sup>P</sup> ballots.
In that case at the end of the day the IRV process will have winnowed
it down to X versus C.
Thereupon C will have a larger Voronoi region than
X and hence will win because the
extra votes X got, namely const&middot;N<sup>P</sup>, 
is sublinear and not enough to
alter the conclusion that C is majority-preferred over X (with success
probability&gt;1-N<sup>P-1</sup> 
or so, anyhow &ndash; e.g. if X unluckily were located very
near to 1/2 this scheme wouldn't work).
</p><p>
It appears than <i>many</i> (say at least N<sup>0.1</sup>) 
choices of "C" would be possible in this argument, proving 
not only that nonmonotonicity
almost-surely happens, but it also almost surely happens in a huge number of 
simultaneous ways.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
The above conjecture and proof sketch will <i>not</i> 
work for
<a href="TidemanRev.html#WBSIRV">WBS-IRV</a> and
For <a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>
instead of IRV, becasue they both always elect Condorcet winners, one exists with
probability&rarr;1 in this model, and raisng a Condrocet winner in votes always still leaves him
a Condorcet winner.
</p><p>
Quas had in mind a <b>different proof-argument</b> for this conjecture
[he gives it just before the start of section 3 of his paper].
His idea would be for X-raising voters to try to enhance the survival of
candidates located near to X who would normally have been eliminated.
Then at some point X will find itself surrounded by two surprisingly-still-alive
rivals, and hence will be eliminated.  
<small>
Quas notes the <i>lemma</i> that,
in this 1D model,
any candidate who, at any stage in the IRV process, is a "local minimum,"
i.e. whose neighbors each have more top-rank votes than it does, 
cannot win.
</small>
Thus, raising X in votes
stops X winning.
</p><p>
Regardless of whether we can prove it, the conjecture seems to be true since Quas 
tells me he has
"convincing computer evidence" for it.
</p><p>
<b>Another open problem &ndash; what about "no-show paradoxes"?</b>
It is an open question whether an analogue of this "&rarr;100% failure theorem" holds not only
for nonmonotonicity, but also for "participation failure." (Conjecturally, it does.) See
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p55">puzzle#55c</a>.

* UPDATE/APOLOGY:
Actually the 2.7778% is for "ballot reversal" strategy and not type-II nonmonotonicity.
Strictly speaking the latter is impossible.  Furthermore, the whole "type-II"
column here contains somewhat-wrong numbers, see
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html#SummTable">
/IrvParadoxProbabilities.html</a>
for the correct ones.

<p>
The best approximation of reality
probably lies somewhere <i>between</i> the Dirichlet and Impartial Culture models... and Quas's
"1D political spectrum" model evidently does.

<p>
Also note that <i>multi</i>winner STV elections can be approximately regarded as a sequence of IRV 
single-winner elections, and multiwinner elections tend to have a lot of candidates.
Therefore, it would seem <i>practically guaranteed</i> that such STV elections will exhibit 
non-monotonic embarrassments &ndash; with more winners and more candidates making these
embarrassments more likely.

"Does nonmonotonicity in three-candidate IRV only happen when the 
Condorcet winner is eliminated?"
 
No.

47: A>C>B
26: B>A
02: C>A>B
25: C>B
 
There is no Condorcet winner. 
 
IRV elects A but if the two C>A>B ballots are changed to A>C>B then
there is still no Condorcet winner and now IRV elects B, a failure of
mono-raise.
 
49: A>C>B
26: B>A
25: C>B
