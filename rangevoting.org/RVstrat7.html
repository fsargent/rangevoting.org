Range voting  optimal strategy theorem
</H2>

<p>
I am not sure who first noticed the theorem that with a large number of other voters, all
of whom vote randomly (hence all candidates equally likely to win), your strategically-best
approval vote is to approve those candidates whose utility exceeds T, and disapprove
the others, and your
best choice of that threshold T is the <i>arithmetic mean</i> utility (for you) of
all the candidates.
</P>
<p>
One proof is 
<a href="RVstrat3.html#meanbasedthreshopt">here</a> and other people have
also sent me proofs of it including Ivan Ryan and John C. Lawrence.
</p>
<p>
We shall now prove a more general theorem.  
Incidentally, these theorems apply to
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> 
where "approving" means scoring a 
candidate with the maximum allowed score and "disapproving"
with the minimum.

<p>
The <font color="red">model</font>:
<ul>
<li> There are N candidates
</li><li>
The chance that A and B are tied for lead (or differ by &le;1 vote) among other voters
in such a way that your vote can decide the election, is P(A)&middot;P(B)
[or is merely <i>proportional</i> to this]
</li><li>
Your utility for candidate X is U(X).
</li><li>
You vote approval-style with threshold T, that is approve candidates
with utility U if U&gt;T and disapprove those with U&lt;T.
</li></ul>
<p>
What is your strategically-best choice of T (maximizing expected utility for
you)?
</p>
<p>
<b>THEOREM:</b>
In the above <font color="red">model</font>, your strategically-best approval threshold T is
</p><center>
T &nbsp; = &nbsp;  &sum;<sub>X</sub> P(X)U(X) / &sum;<sub>Y</sub> P(Y) &nbsp; = &nbsp;  "expected utility of winner."
</center><p>
[Actually, if we sort the U() values into increasing order,
then <i>any</i> T-value between the two U() values surrounding and immediately adjacent
to this formula's value will do; all T in that real interval all are effectively equivalent.]
</p><p>
The 
<a href="RVstrat3.html#meanbasedthreshopt">old theorem</a> had been
just the special case of this when all the P(X) values
happened to be equal, i.e. all candidates equally likely to win.
The new theorem allows
arbitrary relative likelihoods of victory (which can be highly non-uniform) so
it seems much more generally applicable.
</p>
<b>Proof:</b>
If you increase T from
below to above U(C), the effect on your expected utility E, which is
equal to [or merely proportional to; 
this does not matter, and the proportionality factor P(C) which
will arise in the &Delta;E formula also similarly does not matter]
</p><center>
E &nbsp; = &nbsp;  &sum;<sub>A,B with U(A)>T and U(B)&lt;T</sub> P(A) P(B) [U(A)-U(B)]
</center>
<p>
is
</p>
<center>
&Delta;E &nbsp; = &nbsp;  P(C) &middot; { 
&sum;<sub>A with U(A)>T</sub> P(A) [U(A)-U(C)] 
<br>
&ndash; &sum;<sub>B with U(B)&lt;T</sub> P(B) [U(C)-U(B)]
} &nbsp; = &nbsp; 
<br>
&nbsp; = &nbsp;  P(C) &middot; &sum;<sub>X</sub> P(X) [U(X)-U(C)]
</center>
<p>
Note that if U(C) were equal to the "weighted mean utility," that is if
</p><center>
U(C) &nbsp; = &nbsp;  &sum;<sub>X</sub> P(X)U(X) / &sum;<sub>Y</sub> P(Y)
</center><p>
then 
&Delta;E = 0.
If however U(C)&lt;WtdMean, then E is nonmaximum and increases if T is increased 
(since &Delta;E&gt;0).
On the other hand U(C)&gt;WtdMean where
now U(C)&lt;T,
then E would also be nonmaximum since it would similarly
increase if T were decreased from
above to below U(C).
</p><p>
Therefore the condition for E being maximum is that the threshold T be equal to
the weighted mean utility. 
<br>
<b>Q.E.D.</b>

<b>Credit:</b>
The weighted mean utility theorem, and related results, for 
<a href="Approval.html">Approval Voting</a>
traces back to Hoffman, Merrill, and Brams and Fishburn in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  
See Brams &amp; Fishburn's book <i>Approval Voting</I> pages 74-88, also
Appendix C of S.Merrill's book <i>Making Multicandidate Elections More Democratic</i>.
</p>
<p>
<b>More generality still:</b>
If the probability that A and B are tied-for-lead instead is P<sub>AB</sub> which is now <i>not</i>
required to be equal to P(A)P(B) [this latter expression is what would happen if the two component
probabilities were <i>independent</i>] then finding the optimal range-vote is, essentially,
the problem of maximizing
</p>
<center>
&sum;<sub>A&ne;B</sub> P<sub>AB</sub>[U(A)-U(B)][V(A)-V(B)]
</center>
<p>
by choice of the N-vector V subject to the N constraints 0&le;V(X)&le;1.
This is a "linear programming problem."  It therefore is soluble in time polynomial
in the number of bits in the input.  
Note that the optimum is always achieved by an "approval style"
vote in which every V(X)=0 or 1 &ndash; but
<a href="RVstrat2.html">not</a> necessarily by an "honest" approval-style vote.
By going to even-more-general models (e.g. where <i>three</I>-way near-ties can happen
with non-negligible probability) one 
<a href="RVstrat1.html">can</a> generate examples in which
all approval-style range votes are non-optimal so you need a genuine range-style vote.
