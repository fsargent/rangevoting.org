</td></tr>

Got 23 votes on first and 28 on second ballot, growing with time as
he negotiated for more votes,
until he eventually gained 
the necessary 2/3 supermajority.

to be elected; finally Medici who was a rich non-factionalist acquired enough votes to be 
two short; then got over that hump with promises and a 300,000-scudi bribe.
Thereupon he was near-unanimously elected.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>1555</th><td align="center">44-46</td><td align="center">11</td><td>Paul IV by "adoration." In the first two ballots, 
first Pole and then Morone were two votes shy of election; then an attempt to elect Este
fell short.  When the factions 
of King Henry II and Farnese realized they could not get their way they switched to
electing Carafa by "adoration" and the attempt succeeded.   His wrath was greatly
feared, inspiring a unanimous vote.  Later as Paul IV he created the Inquisition and had
his chief rival Morone jailed for heresy, and tried unsuccessfully to do the same
to Pole.

Paid substantial bribes and offered many promises of ecclesiastical advancement 
(not all of which he kept).  As Pope, he turned around and declared simony to be illegal.

<h3> Conclusions </h3>

<p>
Evidently there were two kinds of elections: the essentially uncontested ones
where the vote was supposedly (or it was pretended to be) unanimous, and the contested ones.
Presumably the voting system was essentially irrelevant in most or all of 
the uncontested elections.
In the contested elections it was <i>not</i> true 
that the approval voting was "plurality style"
since even during the 1500s, two centuries after approval voting was enacted,
the number of approvals exceeded the number of voters by a factor of
1.23 to 2.45 (or more; in some cases I do not have all counts hence am underestimating).
This fact would seem to refute the <A href="BUlletBugaboo.html">fears</a>
of some that approval voting would,
after enough time elapsed for the voters to become familiar with it,
"degenerate" into plurality voting.  (Actually, even in the short unanimous elections, there
may well have been great approval of other candidates, although in those cases it is unlikely
this information would have "leaked.")
</p>
<p>
As far as "two party domination" is concerned, there were often powerful
factions, but the number of them was not necessarily "two."
Sometimes it was 1, 2, or 3, in roughly descending order of frequency,
but 2 and 3 were comparably common.  
Unfortunately there is no clear definition of a "faction" and their number thus grows the 
sharper your eyesight.  Thus the Colomer-McLean paper on page 19 claims "six or seven"
factions was a "normal occurrence."
