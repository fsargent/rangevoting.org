<H2> IRV "center squeeze" pathology </H2>
<p>Example election <small>[from electology.org]</small>:</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
   35
</td>
<td>
Rightist > Centrist > Leftist
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
   33
<td>
Leftist > Centrist > Rightist
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    22
<td>
Centrist > Leftist > Rightist
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
   10
<td>
Centrist > Rightist > Leftist
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
[E.g. the first row says that 35% of the voters prefer the rightist,
over the centrist, over the leftist.]
</p>
<p>
In this 100-voter example election, under Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), <b>"Leftist" wins</b>.
("Centrist," with the fewest top-rank votes at 32%, is eliminated in the first round
then Leftist wins 55 to 45 over Rightist.)  This is a fairly <i>realistic</i> scenario
of a kind that often
arises with voters and candidates positioned along a one-dimensional line.
</p>

<p>
That's a common flaw exhibited by IRV 
that tends to hurt centrist parties and instead push countries toward
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">extreme</a> views.
This example election's result is probably unfair and bad for your country.
Why? Consider Centrist running head-to-head against anybody else.  
</p><ul><li>
Centrist would beat Leftist 67-33.
</li><li>
Centrist would beat Rightist 66-35.
</li></ul>
<p>
It's hard to believe these two landslide head-to-head margins were wrong.
(Each has greater margins 
than any US presidential election
contest, at least up to year 2015.) 
</p><p>
So usually, in this kind of situation, IRV 
(1) elects the wrong choice, and 
(2) elects an extreme, not a centrist, choice.
