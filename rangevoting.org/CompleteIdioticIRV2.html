<H2> A completely idiotic Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) election </H2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, 14 Aug 2010 </small></p>

<p>
Here's a simple <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> election 
with 29 voters (of only 3 types) and 3 candidates named "A", "B", and "C".
</p>
<!--
The only(?) major missing IRV paradox is Condorcet-winner-elimination
(since this election has a Condorcet cycle A>B>C>A, there is no Condorcet-winner
to eliminate). However even that
problem is still there in the weakened sense that B sure looks like
the "right" winner, not IRV's choice A.
[Pairwise table: AB=17 vs BA=12; AC=9 vs CA=20; BC=21 vs CB=8.]
-->

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 9 </td>
<td align="center">  A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 12 </td>
<td align="center"> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 8 </td>
<td align="center"> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Instant runoff eliminates C, then <b>A wins</b> by 17 to 12 over B.<br>
</p><blockquote><small>
Notation: A vote "Jim>Amy>Bob" means that voter prefers Jim more than Amy more than Bob,
and says so as her vote.
</small></blockquote><p>
FAILURE OF THE SNIFF TEST:
First of all, without any analysis at all, who do you think ought to win this election?
It sure looks to me like B is the "most correct" and "most democratic"
winner.  (B has the most top- and fewest bottom-rankings.)
But IRV elects A.
</p><blockquote><small>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score voting</a>
considers this election an easy call. 
It would elect B if all voters gave score X to their first choice, Y to their
second, and Z to their third, for <i>any</i> scores X&ge;Y&ge;Z, not all equal.
</small></blockquote><p>
IF WE REVERSE all ballots: then A still wins (but now after B eliminated). 
So the uniquely "best" candidate according to IRV is the same as the 
uniquely "worst" candidate according to IRV! (FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
<a href="Burlington.html">describes</a> this as "IRV elects a majority winner.")

Anne Spanier:
 Instant runoff election is an option for political reform,
Capitol Weekly 20 May 2010:
"Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is a method of voting that determines a majority winner in a 
single election, no matter how many candidates are running...
It also eliminates the 'spoiler' effect." Cites as her source StevenHilll "Fixing Elections" book.

FAIRVOTE "fact sheet":
"Instant runoff voting is a winner-take-all system that in a single election ensures the 
winning candidate has majority support."

</p><blockquote><small>
To "reverse" the ballot "Jim>Amy>Bob" we would change it to "Bob>Amy>Jim,"
i.e. now ranking Jim bottom instead of top.
</small></blockquote><p>
LESS IS MORE: If 2 BCA voters <i>lower</i> the current loser B, that makes B
<i>win</i> under IRV rules (IRV begins by eliminating A).
</p><blockquote><small>
To "lower" Jim in the ballot "Jim>Amy>Bob" we would change it to "Amy>Jim>Bob,"
or (to lower Jim even further, all the way to rock bottom) we could change it to
"Amy>Bob>Jim."
</small></blockquote><p>
NO, MORE IS LESS: <i>Raising</i> the current winner A from bottom to top in 5
BCA votes <i>stops</i> A winning (causes C, the new bottom-ranked guy in all
these votes, to win).
</p><p>
YOU POOR SUCKERS VOTED <i>AGAINST</i> YOUR ENEMY? BIG MISTAKE:
If 5 BCA voters instead of voting maximally-against the hated A, dishonestly 
vote maximally-<i>for</i> him (or just refuse to vote at all), that would have 
<i>prevented</i> A 
from winning and made their lesser-evil C win.  
(Same thing as the last one, just different viewpoint. Point is, IRV in this
election incentivized voters to lie in their votes and made voting honestly be stupid.
Rob Richie, head of FairVote,
the pro-IRV advocacy group,
<a href="Irvtalk.html#RBMscience">described</a>
this as "A[n IRV] voter's best strategy is to sincerely rank the candidates.")
</p><p>
IT SURE WASN'T WISE TO VOTE A-BOTTOM, YOU CHUMPS SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME:
If we delete 5-10 BCA voters, then the old winner A loses (and C
wins).   So it was very foolish of them to vote A-bottom and honestly say they regarded A as
the worst choice &ndash; that made A win &ndash;
they should either have refused to vote, or lied in their vote.
(FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
describes this as "IRV eliminates the 'wasted vote' problem.")

</p><p>
IT SURE WAS CLEVER OF THOSE B-BOTTOM VOTERS TO STAY HOME:
If 2-12 more CAB voters came, that'd make B win. Good job for them
they stayed home and didn't let anybody know they hated B.
</p><p>
YOU PATSIES VOTED <i>FOR</i> YOUR FAVORITE? BIG MISTAKE:
2-12 BCA voters could have prevented their greatest evil A from
winning by dishonestly lowering their favorite B (including in some cases thus 
making their favorite B win!) .
</p><p>
WHOO-WHEE, I'M A KINGMAKER (also known as a <a href="Glossary.html#Spoiler">SPOILER</a>):
After the voters had voted, it was belatedly discovered that B was a convicted criminal
and hence ineligible to run.  
Fortunately, B had not (embarrassingly) won; and since all
voters provided their full preference orders for all candidates, 
this didn't matter &ndash; we can now just erase B from all 
ballots and redo the instant runoff 
count, which will of course still verify that A won and C finished 
in last place.  Right?  Wrong... now C wins.
(Steven Hill from the New America Foundation
&amp; Rob Richie from FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
titled their 26 January 2005 piece in the 
<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>
"Instant runoff would end spoiler effect in elections.")

A spoiler is a minor party candidate that takes away enough votes from one 
major party candidates to ensure the election of the other major party candidate, 
who would not have won otherwise...
     Instant runoff voting eliminates both minority winners and spoilers.

Because instant runoff voting (IRV) is designed to secure a majority victory, 
it assures that the so-called "spoiler effect" will not result in undemocratic outcomes

SOME OTHER WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT LAST ONE:
B is a spoiler since by the act of running, he altered the winner from C to A; 
while if B drops
out of the race at the last minute, he can alter the winner from A back to C.
Also, this can be viewed as a tactical opportunity for B-voters: instead of honestly voting
for their favorite B, they could dishonestly vote for their second choice C.  
The latter move works out better for them.
(And here's another IRV spoiler <a href="IRVpereira.html">example</a>.)
</p><p>
PRECINCT TOTALS? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH:
If we split up the country into 3 districts in various ways, e.g.
</P>
<table width="99%">
<tr><th>West:</th><th>North:</th><th>East:</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 3 </td>
<td align="center">  A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td>
<td align="center"> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td>
<td align="center"> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
</table>

</td><td align="center">

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 2 </td>
<td align="center">  A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 3 </td>
<td align="center"> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td>
<td align="center"> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
</table>

</td><td align="center">

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td>
<td align="center">  A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 5 </td>
<td align="center"> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<!-- <tr>
<td align="center"> 0 </td>
<td align="center"> C>A>B </td>
</tr> -->
</table>

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Then:
<ul><li>
B is the IRV winner in the West.
</li><li>
B is the IRV winner in the North.
</li><li>
B is the IRV winner in the East.
</li><li>
There are no other districts.
</li></ul>
<p>
So "obviously" B wins the whole country, right? Wrong &ndash; A wins.
</p><p>
<small>
You cannot count IRV elections in precincts for this reason, you have to count the whole
election centrally.  No such thing as a precinct "subtotal."
(More <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">discussion</a>.)  
That is a big change in counting procedures in many places
and makes the election more susceptible to a centrally organized fraud.
</small>
</p><p>
YOU WANT <i>COMPLEXITY</i>?
That was only a 3-candidate election with only 3 kinds of voters.  Simple.
(FairVote describes this as "as simple as 1-2-3.")
If you want something more complicated, think about how IRV behaves with 4, 5 or 6 candidates
and a million voters.
