<H2> John Stuart Mill and "ordinal" utility </H2>

<p><small>By Clay Shentup</small></p>

<p>
We can easily see that
Crisp's attempt to save Mill's ideas by demanding
"ordinal" utilities, are faulty. 
Consider a simple
"random draw" experiment where we have three options A, B, and C &ndash;
where your ordered preferences are C > B > A. 
One hat has A and C,
and another has just B.
Which hat do you randomly draw from, given
the choice? 
Well, that depends strictly on the difference in utility
between A and B, and B and C. 
If the utility of C-B is less than the
utility of B-A, then you should pick the second hat, otherwise the
first. 
This situation "calls Mill's bluff."  
Ordinal utilities just aren't good enough to allow people to
make real decisions like this, and since people can and do make such decisions all the time,
ordinal utilities evidently aren't what people use.

We base this claim on the following passage from <i>Wikipedia</i>:

<p>
<b>Ordinal utility theory</b>
states that while the utility of a particular good and service cannot be measured using an 
objective scale, a consumer is capable of ranking different alternatives available.

Mill constantly refers to the higher pleasures as being those
which manifest the elevated capacities of human intellect and
creativity. Indeed he largely contrasts the higher pleasures with
sensual pleasures. Human beings are certainly capable of desiring far
more than mere sensual gratification. Even if we exclude the idea that
many ascetic religions may have taught us to unduly despise the body
and its pleasures, we can still see that throughout history accounts
of human flourishing have involved more than sensuality or material
gratification. Many human purposes and goals involve considerable
hardship and sacrifice yet they remain human goods...

More recently a number of sympathetic
philosophers have tried to make sense of Mill's argument in a way that
does not do violence to his texts but also does not reduce Mill to
making a foolish mistake. In two recent studies Roger Crisp and
Jonathan Riley have offered differing interpretations of Mill's argument.
</p>
<p>
For Crisp, Mill departs from the monistic utilitarianism of
Bentham and is genuine in his account of a distinction between classes
of pleasure which do not merely result in differences of intensity and
duration of pleasureableness. How does the argument work? Crisp
suggests that Mill <i>abandons</i> the idea of full cardinality between
pleasures, &ndash;
this is the view that it is not merely possible to say
that poetry is better than pub games, but it is also possible to give
some measure of how much more valuable poetry is than pub games.
Instead, Mill operates merely with an <i>ordinal</i> ranking of pleasures
&ndash;
which is to say that poetry is better than pushpin, but without being
able to say by how much. What explains the difference between types
of pleasure is not merely the dimensions of intensity and duration
&ndash;
that the intellectual pleasures are more intense and long lasting than
the intense but fleeting pleasures of the flesh
&ndash;
but rather the
intrinsic character of the pleasures themselves. But this seems to
beg the question for what makes the intrinsic character of a higher
pleasure superior to that of a lower pleasure. If it is not intensity
and duration then it seems that Mill is introducing a standard other
than pleasure and as such he is not revising but rather abandoning
hedonism. Mill's argument for the reality of the qualitative
distinction between higher and lower pleasures proceeds by the
introduction of moral experts or those who having experienced both of
two pleasures, one higher and one lower, would not give up the higher
pleasure for any amount of the lower. Such experts raise a number of
questions, not least of which is whether there are such people. What
Mill's argument does illustrate is that what distinguishes the higher
and lower pleasures is some experiential feature other than intensity
and duration. Crisp goes on to suggest that this experienceable
intrinsic nature does not need to be cashed out in terms of some
quantity of value but can itself be an irreducible dimension of value.
He draws a parallel with Bentham's attitude to the value of pleasure
itself. For Bentham, pleasure just is the criterion of value, there is
nothing further in virtue of which pleasure can be identified as
valuable. In a similar way Crisp suggests the intrinsic nature of a
pleasure is also a brute fact
&ndash;
it is simply a fact that someone
experiencing the intrinsic nature of a certain higher pleasure will
value it higher than a lower pleasure. Thus within the individual life
of an experienced observer the <i>value of a higher pleasure is just
recognised as being more valuable, but that difference in value cannot
be reduced to some finite sum of a fungible quality.</i>
