<H2>  "Winning votes" versus "margins" &ndash; two kinds of Condorcet voting</H2>

<p>(<a href="#conclusion">skip to conclusion</a>)</p>

<H3> What they are </H3>

<p>
In "Condorcet voting methods" in which "equal rankings are permitted in votes,"
there are two natural ways to reckon the "strength"
of a "pairwise victory":
margins and winning votes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Margins:</b>
The "margin" of A over B is the number of votes saying A>B, 
minus the number saying B>A.
</p>

<p>
<b>Winning votes:</b>
If more votes say A>B than B>A, then A wins that pairwise contest, and the number
of "winning votes" is precisely the number of votes saying A>B.  Otherwise it is zero.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between these two concepts may sound minor, but it can have some
profound consequences.
</p>

<H3> Effect on a "favorite betrayal" scenario </H3>

<p>
Here is a typical election scenario involving
a <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>.
In this situation almost every election method declares <b>B</b> the winner.
(Every candidate is defeated pairwise by one other, e.g. B is defeated by A.
But since this is the <i>weakest</i> such defeat, B has the strongest claim
to win.) 
</p>
<p>
But the six C>A>B voters are strategically motivated to change their
vote to the dishonest A>C>B, "betraying" their true favorite C in order
to make their "lesser evil" A win.  They could
also try changing it to the less-dishonest
A=C>B, which still leaves C ranked co-equal top and hence does not really betray C,
but which still aims to boost support for their lesser evil A to make A win.
Let us consider the consequences of these two strategic moves.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<caption> Strategic vote change fully-betraying C </caption>
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>

<tr>

<td align="center">
B>C>A
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    6
<td align="center">
A>C>B
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    5
<td align="center">
A>B>C
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this situation, the tallies are
</p>


<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr>
<th> Pairwise </th>
<th> winning votes </th>
<th> margins </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">A>B</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">11-9=<b>2</b></td>

<tr>
<td align="center">B>C</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">14-6=<b>8</b></td>
</tr>
<td align="center">A>C</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">11-9=<b>2</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
</table>

<p>
So that A indeed now wins using either margins or winning votes &ndash;
the betrayal worked.
With the other strategic choice,

<p>
so that there is still a <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>.
In this situation reckoned by <i>winning votes</i> C>A is the weakest defeat, so
now <b>A</b> wins.  But reckoned by <i>margins</i> A>B is the weakest defeat,
so that <b>B</b> remains the winner.
</p>

<p>
In other words, this less-dishonest form of strategic voting, <i>not</i> fully-betraying C,
<i>worked</i> to elect the lesser evil A with winning-votes, but <i>failed</i>
to change the winner with margins.
<p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">

<th>

<p>
What is the moral?
One moral is that with margins-based Condorcet voting, voters are motivated to fully-betray their
favorites that are "third party candidates" with little chance to win.
That could lead ultimately to two-party domination caused by third parties dying out.
But with winning-votes, voters can often get away with a mere partial betrayal,
which causes the third party candidate C still to have a significant number
of top-rank votes, which hopefully causes third parties <i>not</i> to die out,
<i>avoiding</i> degeneration into locked-in two-party domination.
</p>

<p>
However, winning-votes does <i>not</i> succeed in fully avoiding situations in which
full-strength betrayal is the only strategic move that works.  
(<a href="VenzSimp.html">Example</a>.) It just makes
them rarer.  Specifically, in the <a href="IRVStratPf.html">random elections model</a>
in 3-candidate scenarios, i.e. where all 12 honest-vote types
A>B>C, A>C>B, B>A>C, B>C>A, C>A>B, C>B>A, A=B>C, A=C>B, B>A=C, B=C>A, C>A=B, C>B=A
are equally likely,
situations where full-favorite-betrayal is the only strategic
move that works, arise 74% of the time with margins, which is
reduced to 67% with winning votes, in both cases
<i>when</i> (and only when) there is a Condorcet cycle.
And a Condorcet cycle happens in about one election in 19 in this model.
(See <a href="PuzzlePage.html">puzzles 7 and 8</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it would appear that winning votes has a slight advantage over margins
as far as avoiding <a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> is concerned.
</p>

<a name="Laatu"></a>
<H3> But winning votes has some disadvantages </H3>

<p>
But before you rush to abandon "margins" and adopt the more subtle "winning votes" (wv)
approach, you should take into account that wv also has some disadvantages.
</p> 

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
   1000
</td>
<td align="center">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
1000
<td align="center">
C>D
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Consider this 2000-voter election by Juho Laatu (note, the candidates unmentioned in
the votes are regarded as ranked coequal last, that is "A>B" is really "A>B>C=D").
There are two parties whose supporters rank only their own  
candidates (and leave others into to the default shared-last position).  
Winning votes seems to think that all candidates are about equal since  
one additional vote can make any one of the four candidates win (e.g.  
one additional "D>B" vote makes D the winner). Margins seems to think that A and C are  
the strongest candidates since some 500 additional votes are needed to  
make B or D win. 
</p>

<p>
Laatu justifiably considers winning votes to act in a rather dubious way here!
</p>

<!-- 
But before you (now) rush to abandon winning votes in favor of margins,
consider this 100-voter election by Kevin Venzke:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote as expressed </th>
<th> Their Vote in full (as implied) </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
49
</td>
<td align="center">
A 
</td>
<td align="center">
A > B = C
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
27
<td align="center">
C > B
</td>
<td align="center">
C > B > A
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
24
<td align="center">
B 
</td>
<td align="center">
B > A = C
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this (<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">cyclic</a>) situation,
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> 
and Condorcet(margins) both elect A,
but Condorcet(winning votes) elects B.
Venzke prefers the latter since he
considers it "unintuitive to overrule the only contest (C versus B)
in which everyone unanimously expressed
their opinion."
</p>
-->

<p>
<b>Remark:</b>
It has been pointed out that "margins" is equivalent to count each "A=B"
vote as equivalent to half A>B and half B>A.
In other words, with winning-votes
Condorcet, voters could get the effect of having margins Condorcet by
flipping a coin whenever they planned to express an equality.

<a name="DH3"></a>
<H3> Effect on the DH3 scenario </H3>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> A simple DH3 scenario (honest votes). The notation "X,Y"
means a <i>mixture</i> of X>Y and Y>X votes whose composition is not 
immediately known.

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
   37
</td>
<td align="center">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    32
<td align="center">

<tr>
<td align="center">
    31
<td align="center">
   B>A,C>D
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In the 100-voter
election above, there are three main rivals A, B, and C, as well as a "dark horse" D
who is unanimously agreed to be the worst candidate.
(There could also be additional dark horses, but for simplicity we consider the case where
there is only one.)
In this situation, we shall suppose it is not clear to the voters which is
larger, 32 or 31, and it also
is not completely clear which (X>Y or Y>X) is larger in the
"X,Y" mixtures.
</p>

<p>
Now it depends on the mixtures, but  if (e.g.) they are reasonably near equal, then
<b>C</b> is going to be the
Condorcet winner
here (and C is definitely the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> winner).
</p>

<p>
Now. What do the A- and B-voters think?  They think: "C is probably going to
win.  We don't like that.  But suppose we artificially score D above C..."
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">

<p>
Then the pairwise tallies are going to be:

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definitely</td><td>A,B > D > C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Probably</td><td>C > A,B </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In which case we (probably) have a Condorcet cycle scenario.
(It is actually two 3-cycles which share the common DC arc.)
The weakest defeats in these cycles are C>A,B  which means,
under both all the most-commonly-used
Condorcet rules (since they all are equivalent
in the 3-cycle case) and Borda,
that one of {A,B} is going to be the winner.
</p>
<p>
I verified that A wins
in the 50-50 mixture case 
under <a href="RankedPairs.html">Tideman ranked pairs</a>,
<a href="SchulzeComplic.html">Schulze beatpaths</a>, 
and basic Condorcet by using

<p>
In other words, this strategic move <i>worked</i>;
in the original situation C won, but by this strategic burial-move, the A- and B-
voters converted the situation to one in which either A or B would win.
(But note under <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> 
and of course <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, 
it didn't work &ndash; C still wins.)
</p>

<p>
The trouble is, the C-voters here are not going to be willing to sit still and take that.
They've been deprived of their deserved victory.  They feel the need to fight back
with the same exaggerating method:

<p>
and D  &ndash; the candidate unanimously agreed to be worst &ndash;
now is the clear Condorcet and Borda 
winner &ndash; a disaster for everybody!
(But note that with plurality, <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>, 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>, or 
<a href="AppExec.html">approval</a> voting, C still wins.  Those
voting systems are immune to the DH3 pathology.)
</p>

<p>
The DH3 pathology is a tremendous problem for all Condorcet methods and the Borda method.
But now let us consider what happens if we allow <i>equalities</i> in the Condorcet votes.
Then the A- and B-voters have the option of trying a less-dishonest form of 
strategic voting:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">

</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definitely</td><td>C > A,B > D </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
And C still wins.  
(And note: C wins <i>no matter what</i> the "A,B" mixture of A>B, A=B, and B>A votes is,
and no matter what Condorcet variant you use: winning votes, margins; Schulze, 
Tideman ranked pairs,
or basic.)
So what is the moral?  The moral is that this lesser form of 
strategic dishonesty <i>did not work</i> for the A- and B-voters.  Those
voters will therefore still go for <i>full</i> dishonesty, pretending D>C and
not merely that D=C, because that works.  In other words, <i>neither margins, nor winning votes,
cures the DH3 pathology</i>.  
The DH3 pathology hurts <i>every</i> form of Condorcet voting.

<H3> Conclusion </H3>

<p>
"Margins" and "winning votes" are two ways to handle Condorcet voting methods in
which equalities in votes are allowed.   
Neither succeeds in avoiding the horrific
<a href="DH3.html">DH3 pathology</a>.  
Although winning votes is better than margins for avoiding
the <a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> pathology, it does 
<a href="VenzSimp.html">not</a>
completely succeed, and winning votes causes some strange and dubious voting-system
behavior which margins avoids.
