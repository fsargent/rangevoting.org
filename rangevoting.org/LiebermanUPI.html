<p>
HARTFORD, Conn.,  Sept. 16 (UPI) -- The leaders of the reconstituted Connecticut for Lieberman Party say they are seeking ballot access rather than working for Sen. 
Joe Lieberman.
</p>
<p>
The Hartford (Conn.) <i>Courant</i>
said Tuesday that a group of independent political activists who aren't supporters of Lieberman, 
Ind-Conn., took over the name of the party Lieberman formed in 2006 to run as an 
independent.
</p>
<p>
"Then it hit me -- Connecticut for Lieberman has ballot access," 
said John Mertens, a college professor who is active in independent politics and has an 
admitted disdain for Lieberman.</p>
<p>
The <i>Courant</i>
said the party's highest profile act has been endorsing Democratic Party nominee 
Barack Obama for president after Lieberman came out for the Republicans' 
John McCain.
