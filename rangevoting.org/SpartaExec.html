<H2> Ancient Sparta &ndash;  Executive Summary </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Sparta was a caste-based society somewhat like apartheid South Africa or 2000 Israel/Palestine,
with some of Cold War East Germany mixed in too.
</li><li>
The top caste enjoyed democracy.  The others didn't (with varying degrees of how bad it got).
</li><li>
Actually the governental setup contained elements of democracy, monarchy, and aristocracy
all at once, with a lot of "checking and balancing" built in.  
</li><li>
The democratic part was based on continuum <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
</li><li>
For the caste it was designed to work for, 
this governmental setup <i>did</i> work well.
In fact, it was arguably the most successful substantially-democratic
government in history <i>for the people it was designed to be successful for</i>: 
it lasted longer than any other (somewhere between
580 and 1040 years) despite many
external enemies and dangers, plus a social setup that would seem inherently unstable and sick.
</li><li>
Should we dismiss Sparta (and/or dismiss range voting)
because Spartan society contained a lot of (to modern eyes)
disagreeable features?  No.  We should learn what we can from it.   As far as I can tell,
Sparta had its problems, but range voting was not one of them.  
<br>
<small>If you disagree, then ask yourself: should we dismiss the whole idea of
democracy just because <i>Athens</i> had a lot of disagreeable features?

</li>
</ol>
