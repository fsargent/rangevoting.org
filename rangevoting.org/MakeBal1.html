<h2>
Create  range ballot for your own single-winner election (step 1)
</h2>

<p>
This tool will create a reasonably nice looking typeset
range ballot for you, for any range election you want.
It will look something <a href="RVsampleBal.html">like this</a>.
Note: when the final ballot is produced, you can <i>resize</i> your browser
window to taste (you may need to hit the "refresh" button).
You can also go "back" and change font sizes, voter instructions,
candidate names (or whatever else) to taste.
You can then print &amp; xerox it to run a manual range election.

<p>
How many digits in a score (1, 2, or 3)? 
Note: One-digit scores (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 &amp; X) are the easiest to total manually
and lead to the fewest entry-errors.  Two-digit scores (0-99 &amp; XX) lead to
more accuracy, and three-digit scores (0-999 &amp; XXX) to even more.

<select id="digits" name="digits">
 <option value="1">one digit</option>
 <option value="2" selected>two digits</option>
 <option value="3">three digits</option>
</select>

</td>

<td>
<p>
How many voter-options (number of candidates: 1 to 99)? 
Note: although
there are reasons you might want to have a 1-candidate or 2-candidate range election,
we primarily expect range voting will be used for elections with at least 3 candidates.
