<H2> "Burr's dilemma" flaw in Approval voting system </H2>

<p>
Professor <a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/nageljh.html">Jack H. Nagel</a>
(Univ. of Pennsylvania) in 
his paper <i>The Burr Dilemma in Approval Voting</i>,
Journal of Politics 69,1 (February 2007) 43-58]
pointed out the following problem
with the <a href="Glossary.html">approval voting</a> system, which he called
"Burr's dilemma":
</p>

<table bgcolor="#ddffdd"><tr><td>
<blockquote>
<b>Statement of the Burr Dilemma:</b>
When three or more candidates compete for an office that only one can
win, and voters (V) may support two (or more) of them by casting
equal (approval) votes, candidates (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>) seeking support from
the same group (G) of voters will maximize their respective votes if
all members of G vote for both C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. Both candidates thus have
an incentive to appeal for shared support. However, if such appeals
succeed completely and neither candidate receives votes from members
of V-G, the outcome will be at best a tie in which neither C<sub>1</sub> nor C<sub>2</sub>
is assured of victory. Each candidate therefore has an incentive to
encourage some members of G to vote only for himself or herself. If
both C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> successfully follow such a strategy, either or both
may receive fewer votes than some other candidate C<sub>3</sub> supported by
members of V-G. The risk that both C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> will lose is
exacerbated if a retaliatory spiral increases the number of single
votes cast by members of G. At the limit, such retribution reduces
approval voting to conventional single-vote balloting among the
members of G or, if the problem is endemic, among all voters. The
nearer that limit is approached, the lower the probability that
advantages claimed for approval voting will be realized.

And according to Rob Richie:
</p>

<blockquote>
Nagel went on
to  discuss how this played out in the 1796 and 1800 presidential election, where the
presidential electors (who at that time had two equally weighted
votes), made strategic mistakes with major consequences in both
elections.  (Nagel used to say approval voting was better, but now
says <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> is better.)
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Our response:</b>
Nagel has a valid point. 
You might have thought
approval voting was immune to <a href="CandCloning.html">candidate cloning</a>
(and it is if voters vote the same on both clones).
However, due to these irrational-or-strategic-voting "retaliatory spiral" effects
that actually is not so in real life.  
<!--Indeed:
If in 1796 and 1800 this genuinely happened, then it definitely occurs in
real life.-->

<blockquote>
<b>Quote from Nagel's abstract:</b>
It has not previously been recognized that the first four presidential elections
(1788-1800) were <i>conducted using a variant of approval voting</i>. That experiment
ended disastrously in 1800 with the infamous Electoral College tie between
Jefferson and Burr. The tie, ..., resulted less from miscalculation than from a
strategic tension built into approval voting, which forces two leaders appealing
to the same voters to play a game of Chicken.
Because the Burr Dilemma poses
a significant difficulty for approval voting, this paper urges that
researchers give more attention to "instant runoff" reform options,
especially [IRV] and the Coombs rule.

But actually, Burr's dilemma did not result in any pathology in 1800, in the sense that
the two "clones" Burr and Jefferson did <i>not</i> enter into a retaliatory spiral 
causing them both to lose &ndash; they actually both won.
But Burr's dilemma plausibly would genuinely have resulted in a pathology in
<a href="FunnyElections.html#port86">Portugal 1986</a>.
Therefore, "vote splitting" effects <i>can</i> still occur in approval
voting &ndash; contrary to advertising.
</p>

<p>
However, in <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, 
voters can still vote, say, C<sub>1</sub>=99, C<sub>2</sub>=97
thus expressing a slight preference without hurting the {C<sub>1</sub>,C<sub>2</sub>} candidate
set too much. 
So, in practice we can expect that
range voting would alleviate Nagel's Burr-dilemma problem
with approval voting.
</p>
<p>
That seems to be another advantage of range voting versus approval voting.
</p>
<p>
As for Nagel's contention that this problem should perhaps cause us to prefer
IRV or Coombs over Approval voting, that is dubious.  
The <a href="Glossary.html#Coombs">Coombs</a> system is definitely a
complete disaster for strategic voters in elections anything like contemporary US politics,
since strategic voters will vote the "greater evil" artificially <i>last</i>,
which should prevent any of the pre-election favorites from ever winning!
</p><p>
As for IRV, the question is <i>which is more common</i> &ndash; the "Burr dilemma" pathology
for approval voting, or <a href="IRVburr.html">similar pathologies</a>
that happen for strategic voters in IRV elections.
<small>Nagel's paper erroneously suggests that no such pathology can happen
under IRV.  That is because Nagel completely ignores the 
<a href="IRVpartic.html">&quot;favorite betrayal&quot; problem</a> with IRV.
</small>
Examination of our <a href="FunnyElections.html">database</a> suggests that
such problems arise more commonly than the Burr dilemma pathology would arise
under Approval voting &ndash; France 2007,
Peru 2006, and Chile 1970 are examples of elections
that would have yielded pathology under IRV, 
but the only election there that would seem to yield
a Burr Dilemma pathology under approval is Portugal 1986.
Of course, this is not enough examples to draw a statistically significant conclusion.
But what evidence there is, goes the other way,
indicating that Nagel's argument does  <i>not</i> favor IRV over approval voting.
