<H2>Properties of Preferential Election Rules</h2>

<h4>D R Woodall</h4>

<p>
Douglas Woodall is Reader in Pure Mathematics at Nottingham University.

<p>
In this article, he argues that more attention should be paid to properties
of electoral systems, and less to procedures. He lists many properties that
a preferential election rule may or may not have, and discusses them with
reference to STV.

<h3>1.  Introduction</h3>

I have often been struck-and never more than in the last year-by how much
the types of argument used by the supporters of the Single Transferable Vote
(STV) differ from those used by its opponents. When it comes to the details
of the count, the supporters of STV almost invariably try to defend its
procedures directly, on the grounds that they follow certain principles, or
that they do with each vote exactly what the voter would want done with it,
if the voter were able to be present at the count and to express an opinion.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that adopting sensible procedures, at
each stage of the count, will lead to a system with sensible properties, and
the opponents of STV often emphasize its less desirable properties. In
particular, it is now well known that STV is not monotonic: that is, that
increased support, for a candidate who would otherwise have been elected,
can prevent that candidate from being elected. It was ostensibly because of
this and related anomalies that the Plant Report rejected STV.

<p>
Properties of electoral systems can be thought of as "performance
indicators", and like any other performance indicators they need to be used
with care. If one chooses a set of performance indicators in advance, it may
well be possible to manufacture a high score on those indicators in an
artificial way, which does not represent good performance in any real sense.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that the Electoral Reform Society needs to pay
more attention to properties if it is not to be sidelined in the electoral
debate. In particular, since different desirable properties often turn out
to be mutually incompatible, it is important to discover which sets of
properties can hold simultaneously in an electoral system. Only then will it
be possible to decide whether there are electoral systems that retain what
is essential in STV while avoiding some of the pitfalls.

<p>
The purpose of this article is to introduce a long list of technical
properties that an election rule may or may not have, to invent snappy
descriptive names for them all, and to discuss them with special reference
to STV. Except where otherwise indicated, statements made about STV apply
equally well to the Newland-Britton and Meek versions of STV. In a later
article I hope to address the question of monotonicity in more detail.

<h3>2.  Notation and terminology</h3>

As is usual in the Social Choice literature, I shall use lower-case letters
<i>a, b, c</i>,... to denote candidates (or choices). Each voter casts a
<i>ballot</i> containing a <i>preference listing</i> of the candidates,
which is written as (for example) <i>abc</i>, to denote that the voter
places <i>a</i> first, <i>b</i> second and <i>c</i> third, with no fourth
choice being expressed. A preference listing is <i>complete</i> if all
candidates are included in it and <i>truncated</i> if some are left out. (A
preference listing that leaves out just one candidate will be treated by
most election rules, including STV, as if it were complete; but one should
not call it complete, since some election rules may not treat it as such.) A
<i>profile</i> is a set of preference listings, such as might represent the
ballots cast in an election. Profiles may be represented in either of the
forms shown for Elections 1 and 2 below, indicating either the proportion,
or the absolute number, of ballots of each type cast.

<p>
The term <i>outcome</i> will be used in the sense of "possible outcome"
(assuming there are no ties). Thus in an election to fill two seats from
four candidates <i>a, b, c, d</i>, there are six outcomes, corresponding to
the six possible ways of choosing the two candidates to be elected:
{<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>}, {<i>a</i>, <i>c</i>}, {<i>a</i>, <i>d</i>}, {<i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>}, {<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>} and {<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>}.

<pre>
Election 1        Election 2
  (1 seat)          (2 seats)
ab   0.17         a   9    ea   4
ac   0.16         b   9    eb   4
bac  0.33         c  10    fc   1
cb   0.34         d  10    fd   1
                           fe   6
</pre>
An <i>election rule</i> is usually thought of as a method that, given a
profile, chooses a corresponding outcome-or, in the event of a tie, chooses
two or more outcomes, one of which must then be selected in some other way
(such as by tossing a coin). However, this description is not quite adequate
to deal with the complexities of ties. Consider Election 1 above, with the
votes counted by STV (or, rather, by the Alternative Vote (AV), which is the
rule to which STV reduces in a single-seat election). No candidate reaches
the quota of 0.5, and there is an initial tie for exclusion between <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>. If <i>b</i> is excluded then <i>a</i> is immediately elected,
whereas if <i>a</i> is excluded then <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> tie for election.
Thus <i>a</i> is elected with probability &frac12;, and <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
are elected with probability &frac14; each.

<p>
A similar situation arises in Election 2, again under STV. There are 54
votes cast, so the quota is 18, and there is an initial tie for exclusion
between <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. If <i>e</i> is excluded then <i>f</i>,
<i>c</i> and <i>d</i> must also be excluded, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are
elected; whereas, if <i>f</i> is excluded, then <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must
also be excluded, and then <i>e</i> is elected and <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> tie
for second place. Thus the outcome {<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>} is chosen with
probability 1/4, and the outcomes {<i>c</i>, <i>e</i>} and {<i>d,</i>
<i>e</i>} are chosen with probability &frac12; each.

<p>
Because of examples like these, I define a (preferential) <i>election
rule</i> to be a procedure that, given a profile, associates a corresponding
non-negative probability with each outcome, in such a way that the
probabilities associated with all possible outcomes add up to 1. The
"normal" situation is that all the outcomes are given probability 0 except
for one, which has probability 1 (meaning that that outcome is chosen
unequivocally). If anything else happens, then we say that the result is a
<i>tie</i> between all the outcomes that have non-zero probability.

<h3>3.  Axioms</h3>

There are so many properties that an election rule may have, that it is
useful to categorize them in some way. Four in particular seem sufficiently
basic to deserve to be called <i>axioms</i>. The first is more or less
implicit in the above definition of an election rule; but it has a name, and
so for completeness I include it here.

<p>
<i>Anonymity</i>. The result should depend only on the number of ballots of
each possible type in the profile (and not, for example, on the order in
which they are cast, or on extraneous information such as the heights of the
candidates).

<p>
<i>Neutrality</i>. If some permutation is applied to the names of all the
candidates on all the ballots in the profile, then the same permutation
should be applied to the result. For example, since STV is neutral, if
<i>a</i> is replaced by <i>c</i> and <i>c</i> by <i>a</i> on every ballot in
Election 2 above, then STV would choose {<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>} with
probability &frac12; and {<i>a</i>, <i>e</i>} and {<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>} with
probability 1/4 each. One consequence of neutrality is that a tie in a
single-seat election cannot be resolved simply by electing the first in
alphabetical order among the tied candidates.

<p>
A rule that is both anonymous and neutral is called <i>symmetric</i>.

<p>
<i>Homogeneity</i>. The result should depend only on the <i>proportion</i>
of ballots of each possible type. In particular, if every ballot is
replicated the same number of times, then the result should not change. It
is this property that enables us to describe profiles as in Election 1
above, showing the proportion, rather than the absolute number, of ballots
of each type cast.

<p>
<i>Discrimination</i>. If a particular profile <i>P</i>0 gives rise to a
tie, then it should be possible to find a profile <i>P</i> that does not
give rise to a tie and in which the proportion of ballots of each type
differs from its value in <i>P</i>0 by an arbitrarily small amount. This
rules out, for example, the following method of electing one candidate from
three: elect the candidate who beats both of the others in pairwise
comparisons, if there is such a candidate, and otherwise declare the result
a three-way tie. For in that case, not only would the profile in Election 3
below give rise to a tie, but anything at all close to it would also give a
tie, contrary to the axiom of discrimination.

<pre>
                abc  1/3
Election 3:     bca  1/3
(1 seat)        cab  1/3
</pre>
A <i>proper</i> election rule is one that satisfies the above four axioms;
that is, one that is anonymous, neutral, homogeneous and discriminating. The
term "axiom" is used rather freely in the literature as a synonym for
"property", but I shall restrict its use to these four, which I regard as
genuinely axiomatic, in the sense that I am not interested in any rule that
does not satisfy them.

<p>
A word of warning is needed about homogeneity. In any practical election
where the count is carried out by computer, there will be a limit to the
number of decimal places that the computer can hold accurately. Thus there
are bound to be situations in which two numbers that are not really equal
are regarded as equal by the computer program, because they become equal
when rounded to the appropriate number of decimal places. In this case, if
every ballot were replicated the same, sufficiently large, number of times,
then the difference between the two numbers of votes would become
significant, and the computer might give a different result. However, this
is a minor problem, introduced by the practical need to round numbers; the
axiom of homogeneity should be applied to the underlying theoretical rule,
with no rounding.

<p>
With this interpretation, STV is a proper election rule.

<h3>4.  Global or absolute properties</h3>

It is convenient to divide properties into <i>global</i> or <i>absolute</i>
properties on the one hand, and <i>local</i> or <i>relative</i> properties
on the other. The former say something about the result of applying an
election rule to a single profile, whereas the latter say something about
how the result should (or should not) change when certain changes are made
to the profile. Not all properties fall unambiguously into one of these two
classes, but sufficiently many do for the distinction to be useful.

<p>
The most important single property of STV is what I call the <i>Droop
proportionality criterion</i> or <i>DPC</i>. Recall that if <i>v</i> votes
are cast in an election to fill <i>s</i> seats, then the quantity
<i>v</i>/(<i>s</i> + 1) is called the <i>Droop quota</i>. 

<ul>
<li><b>DPC.</b> If, for some whole numbers <i>k</i> and <i>m</i>  satisfying
0 &lt; <i>k</i> &lt;= <i>m</i>, more than <i>k</i> Droop quotas of voters
put the same <i>m</i> candidates (not necessarily in the same order) as the
top <i>m</i> candidates in their preference listings, then at least <i>k</i>
of those <i>m</i> candidates should be elected. (In the event of a tie, this
should be interpreted as saying that every outcome that is chosen with
non-zero probability should include at least <i>k</i> of these <i>m</i>
candidates.)
</ul>

<p>
In statements of properties, the word "should" indicates that the property
says that something should happen, not necessarily that I personally agree.
However, in this case I certainly do: DPC seems to me to be a <i>sine qua
non</i> for a fair election rule. I suggest that any system that satisfies
DPC deserves to be called a <i>quota-preferential</i> system and to be
regarded as a system of proportional representation (within each
constituency)-an STV-lookalike. Conversely, I assume that no member of the
Electoral Reform Society will be satisfied with anything that does not
satisfy DPC.

<p>
The property to which DPC reduces in a single-seat election should hold (as
a consequence of DPC) even in a multi-seat election, and it deserves a
special name.

<ul>
<li><b>Majority.</b> If more than half the voters put the same set of
candidates (not necessarily in the same order) at the top of their
preference listings, then at least one of those candidates should be
elected.
</ul>

<p>
The following rather weak property was formulated with single-seat elections
in mind, but it makes sense also for multi-seat elections and, again, it
clearly holds for STV.

<ul>
<li><b>Plurality.</b> If some candidate <i>a</i> has strictly fewer votes in
total than some other candidate <i>b</i> has first-preference votes, then
<i>a</i> should not have greater probability than <i>b</i> of being elected.
</ul>

The next property has been suggested to me by Brian Wichmann in the light of
his experiences reported in the last issue of <i>Voting matters</i><a
href="#r6">[6]</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>No-support.</b> A candidate who receives no support at all (that is,
who is not listed by any voters in their preference listings) should not be
elected unless every candidates who receives some support is also
elected.
</ul>

This is not satisfied by STV with the Newland-Britton rules. For example, if
<i>x</i> receives no support at all, and the only support that <i>y</i>
receives is on ballots marked <i>ay</i>, where <i>a</i> reaches the quota as
a result of transfers from other candidates, then <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> will
both be recorded throughout as having no votes (since the <i>ay</i> ballots
are not re-examined when <i>a</i> reaches the quota), and so <i>y</i> is as
likely to be excluded as <i>x</i>. It seems that <b>no-support</b> is
satisfied by Meek's version of STV, although I do not have a formal proof of
this.

<p>
The remaining three global properties consist of <i>Condorcet's
principle</i>, which was proposed by M. J. A. N. Caritat, Marquis de
Condorcet (1743-1794), and two modern strengthenings of it. We say that a
voter, ballot or preference listing <i>prefers</i> <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> if
he, she or it lists <i>a</i> above (before) <i>b</i>, or lists <i>a</i> but
not <i>b</i>. Let <i>p</i>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) denote the number of voters
who prefer <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. We say that <i>a</i> <i>beats</i> <i>b</i>
(in pairwise comparisons) if <i>p</i>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) >
<i>p</i>(<i>b</i>,<i> a</i>); that is, if the number of voters who prefer
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is greater than the number who prefer <i>b</i> to
<i>a</i>. We say that <i>a</i> <i>ties with</i> <i>b</i> (in pairwise
comparisons) if <i>p</i>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) = <i>p</i>(<i>b</i>, <i>a</i>).
A <i>Condorcet winner</i> is a candidate who beats every other candidate in
pairwise comparisons. A <i>Condorcet non-loser</i> is a candidate who beats
or ties with every other candidate in pairwise comparisons; note that if
there is more than one Condorcet non-loser then all the Condorcet non-losers
must tie with each other.

<p>
Note that there need not be a Condorcet winner, or even a Condorcet
non-loser. In the profile shown in Election 3 above, <i>a</i> beats
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i> beats <i>c</i> and <i>c</i> beats <i>a</i>, all by the
same margin of 2/3 to 1/3. This is the so-called <i>Condorcet paradox</i> or
<i>paradox of voting</i>: even though each voter provides a linear ordering
of the candidates, the result when the votes are totalled can be a cyclical
ordering. The <i>Condorcet top tier</i> is the smallest nonempty set of
candidates such that every candidate in that set beats every candidate (if
any) outside that set. In Election 3, the Condorcet top tier consists of all
three candidates. If there is a Condorcet winner, then the Condorcet top
tier consists just of the Condorcet winner. If there is a Condorcet
non-loser, then the Condorcet top tier contains all the Condorcet
non-losers, but it may possibly contain other candidates as well.

<p>
Condorcet's principle and the two strengthenings of it given below were
formulated originally for single-seat elections in which every voter
provides a complete preference listing; but I have reworded them here so
that they make sense (although they are not necessarily sensible) for all
preferential elections.

<ul>
<li><b>Condorcet</b>.<a href="#r1">[1]</a> If there is a Condorcet winner,
then the Condorcet winner should be elected.

<li><b>Smith-Condorcet</b>. <a href="#r4">[4]</a> At least one candidate
from the Condorcet top tier should be elected.

<li><b>Exclusive-Condorcet</b> (see Fishburn<a href="#r2">[2]</a>). If there
is a Condorcet non-loser, then at least one Condorcet non-loser should be
elected.
</ul>

Note that <b>Smith-Condorcet</b> and <b>exclusive-Condorcet</b> both imply
<b>Condorcet</b>, and <b>Smith-Condorcet</b> also implies <b>majority</b>.
<b>Smith-Condorcet</b> seems a very natural extension of <b>Condorcet</b>.
<b>Exclusive-Condorcet</b> is also very natural, but it is of much less
importance since it differs from <b>Condorcet</b> only when there is a "tie"
for first place under pairwise comparisons, and that will not happen very
often.

<pre>
Election 4      Election 5
(1 seat)        (2 seats)
abc     0.30    ad      0.36
bac     0.25    bd      0.34
cab     0.15    cd      0.30
cba     0.30
</pre>

STV does not satisfy <b>Condorcet</b>, and so it certainly does not satisfy
either of the above two extensions of it. This can be seen in Election 4
above. Under STV (AV), <i>b</i> is excluded and <i>a</i> is elected.
However, <i>b</i> is the Condorcet winner, beating both <i>a</i> and
<i>c</i> by the same margin of 0.55 to 0.45. This example highlights a
fundamental difference in philosophy between STV and Condorcet-based rules.
Loosely speaking, STV tries to keep votes near the tops of the ballots. Thus
the preferences of the <i>cba</i> voters for <i>b</i> over <i>a</i> will not
even be considered under STV until <i>c</i> is excluded, which means that in
this example they are not considered at all, since <i>b</i> is excluded
before <i>c</i>. In contrast, Condorcet's principle requires that, right
from the outset, the preferences of the <i>cba</i> voters for <i>b</i> over
<i>a</i> should be given equal weight with the similar preferences of the
<i>bac</i> voters. However, despite this difference in philosophy,
<b>Condorcet</b> and <b>majority</b> are not actually incompatible in
single-seat elections: if one wishes, one can use AV (or any other system of
one's choice) to select a candidate from the Condorcet top tier. Any such
rule clearly satisfies <b>Smith-Condorcet</b>, and hence satisfies both
<b>majority</b> and <b>Condorcet</b>, although it is a moot point whether it
is really any better than AV on its own.  In multi-seat elections,
<b>Condorcet</b> is undesirable, in my opinion, because it is incompatible
with DPC, as shown by Election 5 above. Here the quota is 0.333...., and so
DPC requires that <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> should be elected, whereas <i>d</i>
is the Condorcet winner.

<h3>5. Local or relative properties: monotonicity</h3>

Local or relative properties are concerned with what happens when a profile
is changed in some way. We shall say that a candidate is <i>helped</i> or
<i>harmed</i> by a change in the profile if the result is, respectively, to
increase or to decrease the probability of that candidate being elected.

<p>
As we saw in Election 4, under STV the later preferences on a ballot are not
even considered until the fates of all candidates of earlier preference have
been decided. Thus a voter can be certain that adding extra preferences to
his or her preference listing can neither help nor harm any candidate
already listed. Supporters of STV usually regard this as a very important
property, although it has to be said that not everyone agrees; the property
has been described (by Michael Dummett, in a letter to Robert Newland) as
"quite unreasonable", and (by an anonymous referee) as "unpalatable". There
are really two properties here, which we can state as follows.

<ul>
<li><b>Later-no-help.</b> Adding a later preference to a ballot should not
help any candidate already listed.

<li><b>Later-no-harm.</b> Adding a later preference to a ballot should not
harm any candidate already listed.
</ul>

We come now to the different versions of monotonicity. The basic theme is
that a candidate <i>x</i> should not be harmed by a change in the profile
that appears to give more support to <i>x</i>; but one gets different
flavours of monotonicity if one specifies different ways in which the
profile might be changed.

<p>
<b>Monotonicity.</b> A candidate <i>x</i> should not be harmed if:

<ul>
<li>(<b>mono-raise</b>) <i>x</i> is raised on some ballots without changing
the orders of the other candidates;

<li>(<b>mono-raise-delete</b>) <i>x</i> is raised on some ballots and all
candidates now below <i>x</i> on those ballots are deleted from them;

<li>(<b>mono-raise-random</b>) <i>x</i> is raised on some ballots and the
positions now below <i>x</i> on those ballots are filled (or left vacant) in
any way that results in a valid ballot;

<li>(<b>mono-append</b>) <i>x</i> is added at the end of some ballots that
did not previously contain <i>x</i>;

<li>(<b>mono-sub-plump</b>) some ballots that do not have <i>x</i> top are
replaced by ballots that have <i>x</i> top with no second choice;

<li>(<b>mono-sub-top</b>) some ballots that do not have <i>x</i> top are
replaced by ballots that have <i>x</i> top (and are otherwise arbitrary);

<li>(<b>mono-add-plump</b>) further ballots are added that have <i>x</i> top
with no second choice;

<li>(<b>mono-add-top</b>) further ballots are added that have <i>x</i> top
(and are otherwise arbitrary);

<li>(<b>mono-remove-bottom</b>) some ballots are removed, all of which have
<i>x</i> bottom, below all other candidates.
</ul>

There is also the following property, which is not strictly a form of
monotonicity but is very close to it. It is an extension to multi-seat
elections of a property proposed by Moulin<a href="#r3">[3]</a> for
single-seat elections.

<ul>
<li><b>Participation</b>. The addition of a further ballot should not, for
any positive whole number <i>k</i>, reduce the probability that at least one
candidate is elected out of the first <i>k</i> candidates listed on that
ballot.
</ul>

These properties are not all independent. For example,

<ul>
<li><b>mono-raise-random</b> implies both <b>mono-raise</b> and
<b>mono-raise-delete</b>;

<li><b>mono-raise</b> and <b>later-no-help</b> together imply
<b>mono-raise-delete</b>;

<li><b>mono-raise-delete</b> and <b>later-no-harm</b> together imply
<b>mono-raise-random</b>;

<li><b>mono-sub-top</b> implies <b>mono-sub-plump</b>;

<li><b>mono-sub-plump</b> and <b>later-no-harm</b> together imply
<b>mono-sub-top</b>;

<li><b>mono-append</b> and <b>mono-raise-delete</b> together imply
<b>mono-sub-plump</b>;

<li><b>mono-append</b> and <b>mono-raise-random</b> together imply
<b>mono-sub-top</b>;

<li><b>mono-add-top</b> implies <b>mono-add-plump</b>;<b>

<li>mono-add-plump</b> and <b>later-no-harm</b> together imply
<b>mono-add-top</b>;

<li><b>participation</b> implies <b>mono-add-top</b>.
</ul>

Moreover, in single-seat elections,

<ul>
<li><b>participation</b> implies <b>mono-remove-bottom</b>.
</ul>

Also, if truncated preference listings are not allowed, then 
<b>mono-raise-random</b> implies <b>mono-sub-top</b>.

<pre>
                      ab     10
    Election 6:       bca     8
      (1 seat)        ca      7
</pre>

STV satisfies <b>mono-append</b> but none of the other properties, although
in single-seat elections AV satisfies <b>mono-add-plump</b> and
<b>mono-add-top</b>.  To see that AV does not satisfy <b>mono-raise</b>,
<b>mono-raise-delete</b>, <b>mono-raise-random</b>, <b>mono-sub-plump</b>,
<b>mono-sub-top</b> or <b>mono-remove-bottom</b>, consider its effect in
Election 6 above.   As it stands, <i>c</i> is excluded and <i>a</i> is
elected. But if two of the <i>bca</i> ballots are removed, or replaced by
<i>a</i> or by <i>abc</i> or by anything else starting with <i>a</i>, then
<i>b</i> is excluded and <i>c</i> is elected instead of <i>a</i>.

<pre>
     Election 7      Election 8
     (2 seats)       (2 seats)
     ab      30      ac      207
     ac      90      bd      198
     bd      59      bdac     12
     cb      51      cd      105
     d       70      dc      105
</pre>

To see that STV does not satisfy <b>mono-add-plump</b> or
<b>mono-add-top</b>, consider Election 7. The quota is 300/3 = 100, so that
<i>a</i> is elected with a surplus of 20. This is divided 5 to <i>b</i>, 15
to <i>c</i>, and so <i>b</i> has 64 votes to <i>c</i>'s 66, <i>b</i> is
excluded, and <i>d</i> is elected. Suppose now that we add a further 24
ballots with <i>d</i> top. The quota is now 324/3 = 108, so that <i>a</i>'s
surplus is now only 12. This is divided 3 to <i>b</i>, 9 to <i>c</i>, and so
<i>b</i> has 62 votes to <i>c</i>'s 60, <i>c</i> is excluded, and <i>b</i>
is elected instead of <i>d</i>.

<p>
Although all the monotonicity properties look attractive, I do not think
that <b>mono-remove-bottom</b> is desirable in multi-seat elections.
Consider Election 8. The quota is 627/3 = 209, and so DPC requires that we
elect <i>b</i> and either <i>c</i> or <i>d</i>. It seems to me that
{<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>} is clearly the better result (although STV gives
{<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>}). But if we now remove the 12 <i>bdac</i> ballots, then
the quota drops to 205, so that we must elect <i>a</i> and either <i>c</i>
or <i>d</i>. It seems to me that now {<i>a</i>, <i>d</i>} is the better
result (although STV gives {<i>a</i>, <i>c</i>}). Thus the removal of the 12
ballots that have <i>c</i> bottom <i>should</i>, in my opinion, harm
<i>c</i>.

<p>
All the monotonicity properties seem desirable in single-seat elections.
However, I proved<a href="#r7">[7]</a> that no rule simultaneously
satisfies <b>mono-sub-plump</b>, <b>later-no-help</b>, <b>later-no-harm</b>,
<b>majority</b> and <b>plurality</b>. Since I do not think anyone would
seriously consider a rule that did not satisfy both <b>majority</b> and
<b>plurality</b>, this shows that in order to have <b>mono-sub-plump</b> one
must sacrifice either <b>later-no-help</b> or <b>later-no-harm</b> (or
both). Whether or not this is desirable may depend on what other properties
one can gain at the same time.

<p>
<b>Mono-raise-random</b>, <b>mono-sub-top</b> and <b>participation</b> are
very strong properties, and it is possible that they are incompatible with
DPC. If one could find a reasonable-looking "STV-lookalike" rule that
satisfied all the other monotonicity properties (except for
<b>mono-remove-bottom</b> when there is more than one seat), then I
personally might well prefer it to STV itself. But we are a long way from
finding such a rule at the moment.

<p>
While on the subject of monotonicity, I should mention one other
monotonicity property, if only to dismiss it immediately.

<ul>
<li><b>House-monotonicity</b>. No candidate should be harmed by an increase
in the number of seats to be filled, with no change to the profile.
</ul>

This seems to me to be plain wrong. Consider the profile in Election 5, for
example, which is a very slight modification of one suggested to me by David
Hill. If one were using this profile to fill a single seat, then clearly
<i>d</i> should be elected (although that is not the result achieved by AV).
But if this same profile were used to fill three seats, then clearly
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> should be elected; thus <i>d</i> is harmed
by the increase in the number of seats.

<p>
Another property that is related to monotonicity is known in the literature
as <i>consistency</i><a href="#r8">[8]</a> or <i>reinforcement</i><a
href="#r3">[3]</a>, but I prefer to call it by its mathematical name:

<ul>
<li><b>Convexity</b>. If the voters are divided into two districts and the
ballots from each district are processed separately and the results in the
two districts are the same, then processing the ballots of all voters
together should give the same result.
</ul>

<pre>
                    (a)    (b)   (a)+(b)
              ab     6      3      9
Election 9:   bc     4      4      8
(1 seat)      cb     3      6      9
</pre>

STV does not satisfy <b>convexity</b>. Again, I cannot do better than to
quote an example of David Hill's (Election 9). In district (a), <i>c</i> is
excluded and <i>b</i> is elected. In district (b), <i>a</i> is excluded and
<i>b</i> is elected. But when the ballots from the two districts are
processed together, <i>b</i> is excluded and <i>c</i> is elected.

<p>
<b>Convexity</b> is one of the best-understood of all properties. Young<a
href="#r8">[8]</a> proved that a symmetric preferential election rule for
single-seat elections satisfies <b>convexity</b> if and only if it is
equivalent to a point scoring rule (in which one gives each candidate so
many points for every voter who puts them first, so many for every voter who
puts them second, and so on, and elects the candidate with the largest
number of points). Since no point scoring rule can possibly satisfy DPC, it
follows that <b>convexity</b> and DPC are mutually incompatible. This is a
pity, because <b>convexity</b> implies several of the monotonicity
properties; but, sadly, it is of no use to us.

<p>
Of course, the absence of convexity will hardly ever be noticed in practice,
since elections are not counted both in separate districts and together as a
whole. But it is worrying inasmuch as it may suggest that something odd is
going on.

<h3>6.  Further properties</h3>

A question that is sometimes asked about STV is, is a truncated preference
listing treated as if all the remaining candidates were placed equal last?
Since STV (in its usual formulation) does not allow for equality of
preference, the question does not really make sense. But one can make sense
of it as follows. The <i>symmetric completion</i> of a truncated preference
listing is obtained by taking all possible completions of it with equal
weight, chosen so that the total weight is 1. For example, suppose that
there are five candidates, <i>a, b, c, d, e</i>. Then 

<ul>
<li>the symmetric completion of a ballot marked <i>abcd</i> is a single
ballot marked <i>abcde</i>, with weight 1;

<li>the symmetric completion of a ballot marked <i>abc </i>consists of two
ballots, each with weight &frac12;, one marked <i>abcde</i> and the other
marked<i> abced</i>;

<li>the symmetric completion of a ballot marked <i>ab</i> consists of six
ballots, each with weight 1/6, completed in the six different possible ways:
that is, <i>abcde, abced, abdce, abdec, abecd </i>and<i> abedc</i>; 

<li>the symmetric completion of a ballot marked <i>a</i> consists of 24
ballots, each with weight 1/24, completed in the 24 different possible ways;
and so on.

<li><b>Symmetric-completion.</b> A truncated preference listing should be
treated in the same way as its symmetric completion.
</ul>


<p>
It is not difficult to see that AV satisfies <b>symmetric-completion</b>.
Although AV is usually described in terms of a quota, it can alternatively
be described as follows: repeatedly exclude the candidate with the smallest
number of votes, until there is only one candidate left. The effect of
replacing truncated preference listings by their symmetric completions is
simply that, at each stage in the count, the votes of all non-excluded
candidates are increased by the same amount. It follows that the order of
exclusions is not affected, nor therefore is the eventual winner.

<pre>
                a       60
Election 10:    ab      60
(2 seats)       b       14
                c       46
</pre>

To see that STV does not satisfy <b>symmetric-completion</b> in general,
consider Election 10. The quota is 180/3 = 60, so that <i>a</i> is elected
with a surplus of 60. Under the Newland-Britton rules, the whole of
<i>a</i>'s surplus goes to <i>b</i>, who is elected. Under Meek's method,
the transfer of <i>a</i>'s surplus ends with the quota reduced to (180 -
36)/3 = 48, with 36 non-transferable votes going to 'excess', and 36 votes
transferred to <i>b</i>. Either way, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are elected.
However, if each ballot is replaced by its symmetric completion, then, of
<i>a</i>'s surplus of 60 votes, 45 go to <i>b</i> and 15 to <i>c</i>, and
<i>c</i> is elected instead of <i>b</i>.

<pre>
Election 11     Election 12
(2 seat)        (3 seats)
ab      40      ab      40
ba       2      ba       2
cd      12      cd      12
dc       6      dc       6
                e      180
</pre>
David Hill has sent me an example, which I have modified slightly above, to
show that quota reduction is preferable to symmetric completion in STV. In
Election 11 the quota is 60/3 = 20, and so <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are
elected. In Election 12 the quota is 240/4 = 60, so that <i>e</i> is elected
with a surplus of 120. Under symmetric completion, this would be used to
increase the votes of the remaining candidates by 30 each, so that <i>a</i>
would be elected first, after which <i>d</i> would be excluded and <i>c</i>
would be elected. However, if the quota is reduced to 20 after the election
of <i>e</i> then <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are elected as in Election 11. To
paraphrase David's comments slightly, "Election 12 has one extra candidate,
one extra seat, and a large number of extra voters whose sole wish
(apparently) is to put that extra candidate into that extra seat. It is
nonsense that the original 60 voters should get <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>
elected in Election 12 instead of the <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> they would have
got from Election 11."

<p>
The remaining properties are all concerned with the avoidance of "wrecking
candidates".  A "wrecking candidate" is a candidate who is not elected but
who, by standing for election and so "splitting the vote", prevents someone
else from being elected. One might naively hope to avoid wrecking candidates
altogether, which would result in the Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives, or <b>IIA</b>:

<ul>
<li><b>IIA</b>. If a candidate <i>x</i> is not elected, then the result of
the election should be as if <i>x</i> had not stood for election.
</ul>

However, it is easy to see that no discriminating election rule can satisfy
both <b>IIA</b> and <b>majority</b>. For, consider Election 3 above. By the
axiom of discrimination, there must be a profile arbitrarily close to this
one that does not give rise to a tie. If this profile results in the
election of <i>a</i>, then <i>b</i> is a wrecking candidate: for, if
<i>b</i> had not stood for election, then <i>c</i> would have been elected
(by <b>majority</b>, since roughly two thirds of the voters prefer <i>c</i>
to <i>a</i>); thus the result of the election is not as if <i>b</i> had not
stood. In a similar way, if <i>b</i> is elected then <i>c</i> is a wrecking
candidate, and if <i>c</i> is elected then <i>a</i> is a wrecking candidate.

<p>
In an attempt to find a property weaker than <b>IIA</b> but expressing a
similar idea, I came up with the following.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak-IIA</b>. If <i>x</i> is elected, and one adds a new candidate
<i>y</i> ahead of <i>x</i> on some of the ballots on which <i>x</i> was
first preference (and nowhere else), then either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> should
be elected.
</ul>

Unfortunately I do not know of any sensible election rule that satisfies
even this. Certainly STV does not. For example, if there are 15 ballots
marked <i>x</i> and 14 marked <i>z</i>, then AV (and any sensible rule) will
elect <i>x</i>; but if 10 of the 15 <i>x</i> ballots are now changed to read
<i>yx</i>, then AV will exclude <i>x</i> and elect <i>z</i> instead.

<p>
An alternative weakening of <b>IIA</b> has been proposed by Tideman<a href="#r5">
[5]</a>. In his terminology, a number of candidates form a <i>set of
clones</i> if every preference listing that contains one of them contains
all of them, in consecutive positions (but not necessarily always in the
same order). He says that a single-seat election rule is <i>independent of
clones</i> if it satisfies the following properties, which I have
reformulated here so that they make sense for multi-seat elections as well.

<ul>
<li><b>Clone-in</b>. The expected number of candidates elected from any
given set of clones should not increase if one member of the set is deleted
from every ballot containing it.

<li><b>Clone-no-help</b>. Replacing a candidate <i>x</i> by a set of clones
should not help any other candidate <i>y</i>.

<li><b>Clone-no-harm</b>. Replacing a candidate <i>x</i> by a set of clones
should not harm any other candidate <i>y</i>.
</ul>

<pre>
                xx'a    13
                x'xa    11
Election 13:    abc     10
(2 seats)       bc      12
                c       14
</pre>

It is not difficult to see that AV satisfies all the <b>clone</b>
properties. I am fairly sure that STV also satisfies <b>clone-in</b> in
multi-seat elections, although I do not have a formal proof of this. To see
that STV does not satisfy the other two <b>clone</b> properties, consider
Election 13. The quota is 60/3 = 20. Nobody having reached the quota,
<i>a</i> is excluded and <i>b</i> is elected; then <i>x</i>' is excluded and
<i>x</i> is elected. However, if the clones <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>' are
replaced by a single candidate <i>x</i>, then <i>x</i> has 24 votes
initially and so is elected, and the surplus of 4 votes goes to <i>a</i>;
therefore <i>b</i> is excluded, and <i>c</i> is elected instead of <i>b</i>.
So replacing <i>x</i> by a pair of clones helps <i>b</i> and harms
<i>c</i>.

<p>
<b>Clone-no-harm</b> is actually incompatible with DPC. To see this, note
that if only two candidates stand in a 2-seat election, where the voting is
(say) <i>x</i> 70, <i>y</i> 30, then both must be elected. But if <i>x</i>
is replaced by a pair of clones and the voting is now <i>xx</i>' 35,
<i>x'x</i> 35, <i>y</i> 30, then DPC requires that <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>'
should both be elected. This suggests that <b>clone-no-harm</b> is not a
desirable property for multi-seat elections-and Tideman never suggested that
it was. But <b>clone-in</b> and <b>clone-no-help</b> both look sensible to
me, even for multi-seat elections.
