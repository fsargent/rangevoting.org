<H2> Enmity between alike candidates and parties </H2>

<p>
It is interesting to compare Socialist parties in the USA, with their
equivalents in other countries.
In Spain, the Socialists won the election and took control of the government (2004).
In France (2006), supposedly the Socialist candidate 
Segolene Royal is currently regarded as the most
likely to win the presidency. 
[Later note: she unexpectedly lost to N.Sarkozy.]
In the USA, there are several socialist parties, all of them generally
getting tiny
fractions of 1% of the vote.
</p>

<p>
Why the huge difference?  Is it really the case that USA voters are so immensely
less socialist in their hearts than French and Spanish voters?
</p>

<p>
We don't think so.  Sure, we are willing to believe in a factor of 2 or 3
more socialism in French and Spanish hearts.
But not a factor over 1000.
</p>

<p>
The real difference is that in France, elections for president are conducted with the top-2
runoff system, which is a system that does not cause long-term decline and death of
third parties.  (The USA's <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> system, and 
Australia's <a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff</a> system,
<i>do</i> cause such <a href="TPHist.html">decline and death</a>.)  
In Spain, elections are done via a party-list
<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>
system, which again is one in which third parties are
capable of surviving and flourishing.
</p>

<p>
But it gets worse.
In the USA, there is not just one big Socialist Party.  No.  There are numerous
tiny socialist parties, most or all of which 
appear 
(based on speaking to their members)
to <i>hate</i> each other
&ndash; although they would appear to be similar based on examining their platforms.
These include the
<a href="http://www.sp-usa.org/">Socialist Party of the USA</a>,
<a href="http://www.themilitant.com">Socialist Workers Party</a>,
<a href="http://www.socialequality.com/">Socialist Equality Party</a>,
<a href="http://www.thelaborparty.org/">Labor Party</a>,
<a href="http://www.slp.org/">Socialist Labor Party</a>,
and the
<a href="http://www.socialistaction.org/">Socialist Action Party</a>.
Such fratricidal enmity does not seem to exist (at last not to
nearly as large a degree) in France and Spain.  
</p>
<p>
Why is that?
</p>

<h3> It's the <i>voting system</i>, stupid </h3>
<p>
Each mini-party has to fight with its siblings for the tiny share of the USA
vote-pie consisting of socialist voters.  
If we had <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
or some other <a href="CandCloning.html">clone-immune</a>
voting system, no such fratricidal fight would exist
and there would be no such thing as a "share of the vote pie" and no such thing as 
"vote splitting."
Problem solved.
