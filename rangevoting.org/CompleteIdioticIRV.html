<H2> A completely idiotic Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) election </H2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, 14 Aug 2010 </small></p>

<p>
Here's a simple <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> election 
with 57 voters and 3 candidates named "A", "B", and "C".
</p>
<!--
simultaneously exhibiting both kinds of
monotonicity failure, both kinds of participation failure, favorite-
betrayal, district-consistency failure,
and "winner=loser" reversal paradox too.

The only(?) major missing IRV paradox is Condorcet-winner-elimination
(since this election has a Condorcet cycle A>B>C>A, there is no Condorcet-winner
to eliminate). However even that
problem is still there in the weakened sense that B sure looks like
the "right" winner, not IRV's choice A.
[Pairwise table: AB=33 vs BA=24; AC=18 vs CA=39; BC=42 vs CB=15.]

Instant runoff eliminates C, then <b>A wins</b> by 33 to 24 over B.<br>
</p><blockquote><small>
Notation: A vote "Jim>Amy>Bob" means that voter prefers Jim more than Amy more than Bob,
and says so as her vote.
</small></blockquote><p>
FAILURE OF THE SNIFF TEST:
First of all, without any analysis at all, who do you think ought to win this election?
It sure looks to me like B is the "most correct" and "most democratic"
winner.  (B has the most top- and fewest bottom-rankings.)
But IRV elects A.
</p><blockquote><small>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score voting</a>
considers this election an easy call. 
It would elect B if all voters gave score X to their first choice, Y to their
second, and Z to their third, for <i>any</i> scores X&ge;Y&ge;Z, not all equal.
</small></blockquote><p>
IF WE REVERSE all ballots: then A still wins (but now after B eliminated). 
So the uniquely "best" candidate according to IRV is the same as the 
uniquely "worst" candidate according to IRV! (FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
<a href="Burlington.html">describes</a> this as "IRV elects a majority winner.")
</p><blockquote><small>
To "reverse" the ballot "Jim>Amy>Bob" we would change it to "Bob>Amy>Jim,"
i.e. now ranking Jim bottom instead of top.
</small></blockquote><p>
LESS IS MORE: If 4-5 BCA voters <i>lower</i> the current loser B, that makes B
<i>win</i> under IRV rules (IRV begins by eliminating A).
</p><blockquote><small>
To "lower" Jim in the ballot "Jim>Amy>Bob" we would change it to "Amy>Jim>Bob,"
or (to lower Jim even further, all the way to rock bottom) we could change it to
"Amy>Bob>Jim."
</small></blockquote><p>
NO, MORE IS LESS: <i>Raising</i> the current winner A from bottom to top in 10
BCA votes <i>stops</i> A winning (causes C, the new bottom-ranked guy in all
these votes, to win).
</p><p>
YOU POOR SUCKERS VOTED <i>AGAINST</i> YOUR ENEMY? BIG MISTAKE:
If 10 BCA voters instead of voting maximally-against the hated A, dishonestly 
vote maximally-<i>for</i> him (or just refuse to vote at all), that would have 
<i>prevented</i> A 
from winning and made their lesser-evil C win.  
(Same thing as the last one, just different viewpoint. Point is, IRV in this
election incentivized voters to lie in their votes and made voting honestly be stupid.
Rob Richie, head of FairVote,
the pro-IRV advocacy group,
<a href="Irvtalk.html#RBMscience">described</a>
this as "A[n IRV] voter's best strategy is to sincerely rank the candidates.")
</p><p>
IT SURE WASN'T WISE TO VOTE A-BOTTOM, YOU CHUMPS SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME:
If we delete 10-20 BCA voters, then the old winner A loses (and C
wins).   So it was very foolish of them to vote A-bottom and honestly say they regarded A as
the worst choice &ndash; that made A win &ndash;
they should either have refused to vote, or lied in their vote.
(FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
describes this as "IRV eliminates the 'wasted vote' problem.")
</p><p>
IT SURE WAS CLEVER OF THOSE B-BOTTOM VOTERS TO STAY HOME:
If 4-26 more CAB voters came, that'd make B win. Good job for them
they stayed home and didn't let anybody know they hated B.
</p><p>
YOU PATSIES VOTED <i>FOR</i> YOUR FAVORITE? BIG MISTAKE:
3-24 BCA voters could have prevented their greatest evil A from
winning by dishonestly lowering their favorite B (including in some cases thus 
making their favorite B win!) .
</p><p>
WHOO-WHEE, I'M A KINGMAKER (also known as a <a href="Glossary.html#Spoiler">SPOILER</a>):
After the voters had voted, it was belatedly discovered that B was a convicted criminal
and hence ineligible to run.  
Fortunately, B had not (embarrassingly) won; and since all
voters provided their full preference orders for all candidates, 
this didn't matter &ndash; we can now just erase B from all 
ballots and redo the instant runoff 
count, which will of course still verify that A won and C finished 
in last place.  Right?  Wrong... now C wins.
(FairVote, the pro-IRV advocacy group,
describes this as "IRV eliminates the 'spoiler' problem.")
</p><p>
SOME OTHER WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT LAST ONE:
B is a spoiler since by the act of running, he altered the winner from C to A; 
while if B drops
out of the race at the last minute, he can alter the winner from A back to C.
Also, this can be viewed as a tactical opportunity for B-voters: instead of honestly voting
for their favorite B, they could dishonestly vote for their second choice C.  
The latter move works out better for them.
(And here's another IRV spoiler <a href="IRVpereira.html">example</a>.)

PRECINCT TOTALS? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH:
If we split up the country into 3 districts in various ways, e.g.

<table width="99%">

<td align="center"> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<!-- <tr>
<td align="center"> 0 </td>
<td align="center"> C>A>B </td>
</tr> -->
</table>

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Then:
<ul><li>
B is the IRV winner in the East.
</li><li>
B is the IRV winner in the North.
</li><li>
B is the IRV winner in the South.
</li><li>
There are no other districts.
</li></ul>
<p>
So "obviously" B wins the whole country, right? Wrong &ndash; A wins.
</p><p>
<small>
You cannot count IRV elections in precincts for this reason, you have to count the whole
election centrally.  No such thing as a precinct "subtotal."
(More <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">discussion</a>.)  
That is a big change in counting procedures in many places
and makes the election more susceptible to a centrally organized fraud.
</small>
</p><p>
YOU WANT <i>COMPLEXITY</i>?
That was only a 3-candidate election with only 3 kinds of voters.  Simple.
(FairVote describes this as "as simple as 1-2-3.")
If you want something more complicated, think about how IRV behaves with 4, 5 or 6 candidates
and a million voters.
</p>
<blockquote><small>
If, on the other hand, you want a bit more simplicity:
if you replace the numbers (18,24,15) in the election table we started with
by
(12,17,11) or (9,12,8) 
then you should still get all the same paradoxes 
(with the numbers appropriately changed)
but with only 40 or 
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">29</a> 
voters instead of 57.  Readers may enjoy working those elections out for themselves.
