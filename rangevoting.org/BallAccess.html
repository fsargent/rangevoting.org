<H2> Ridiculous USA Ballot Access Laws designed to discriminate against third parties </H2>

</p>
Among the world's democracies,
the United States has by far the worst  ballot access situation.
Each state writes its own ballot access laws, even for federal office. 
Sometimes these laws clearly are intentionally written to force one- or two-party domination.
Since there is no single standard for the whole nation, the public and even the media are 
generally ignorant about ballot access laws.
</p>

<dt>
<b>Georgia:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
 Georgia in 1943 required new party and independent candidates to
submit a petition signed by 5% of the number of registered voters in order to 
get on the ballot for any office! 
Previously, any party could get on the ballot just by requesting it. 
(And all petition signers are subject to subpoena to determine if they actually signed.)
Result: since 1943,  <i>zero</i> third-party candidates have ever managed even to
<i>get on the
ballot</i> for a  Georgia  U.S. House of Representatives seat (in about 800 races total).
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Florida:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
The ballot access laws for third parties and independent candidates have been very 
severe since 1931.  Since then only <i>two</i> third party candidates for
the U.S. House of Representatives and only <i>one</i> 
for the U.S. Senate
have managed to get on the ballot.
(And there has been no third party or independent candidate on the ballot for 
Governor of Florida since 1920.)
As of 2005, a filing fee of 7% of the annual salary of the office is also required 
unless the candidate is a pauper, while a third party or independent candidate for 
any statewide office (other than US president) needs 196,255 valid
signatures &ndash; beyond what any independent candidate in any state in the USA
has ever obtained.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Texas:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
To run for Texas Governor as an Independent in 2006, Richard S. "Kinky" Friedman
had to acquire 45000
signatures in a short time, all of them notarized.  
He accomplished that, but found it almost impossible and claims it had
never been done before.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Arkansas:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
New parties, to get on ballot, require by 1971 law a petition signed
by a number of voters exceeding 7% of the last vote cast. 
A court held that unconstitutional in 1977, so they changed it to 3%.
Also, the petition must be completed in four months 
during the odd year before an election year.
No political party has ever succeeded in getting on the Arkansas ballot, under either rule.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>West Virginia:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
This one is an elegant "catch-22."
Third party and independent candidates for office (other than US president) must 
circulate their petition before the primary. 
It is a crime for any petition circulator to approach anyone without saying 
"If you sign my petition, you cannot vote in the primary." 
Furthermore, it is impossible for third party or independent candidates 
(not running for US president) to ever know in advance if they have 
enough valid signatures because if anyone who signs a candidate's petition 
then votes in a primary, the signature of that person is invalid. 
For candidates, it is impossible to know who will actually 
vote in the primary, and it is too late to get signatures after the primary.
Also: petition circulators cannot leave their home precinct.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Minnesota:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
1961 law requires petition to be completed within a <i>2-week</i> period.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Maryland:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
1941 law requires all petition signers to be published in one newspaper 
in each county in the state, by the collector of the petitions.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Massachusetts:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
Richard Winger of <i>Ballot Access News</I> says, "Massachusetts ballot access
procedures for members of small qualified parties to get <i>on their own party's
primary ballot</i> are a disgrace, the worst in the nation. They are so bad, they
even injure Republicans in MA. In 2008, out of the 10 U.S. House races in MA, there was
no Republican in six of them."

<H2> "Sore loser laws" designed to foster major-party rule and prevent dissent </H2>

<p>
In 2006, nationwide attention was focused on the Democratic Party primary for the Connecticut
senate race.  Newcomer Ned Lamont beat out incumbent senator Joe Lieberman.
Lieberman then decided to continue to run as an independent, leading to
a 3-way race between Lamont(D), Lieberman(I) and Alan Schlesinger(R).
This made it a "spoiler" scenario likely in which Lieberman and Lamont would
split the vote allowing the Republican Schlesinger (who was less popular than
either and had been involved in big money gambling under the fake name "Alan Gold,"
causing State GOP Chair George Gallo to 
moan &ndash; quoted in the <i>Hartford Courant</i> &ndash;
"Our mistake is that we only vetted candidates using
their real
names, not aliases";
the <i>Courant</i>
further reported that Schlesinger had been sued twice by casinos to 
collect unpaid gambling debt) 
to win.
</p>
<small><p>
Actually, after all the top Republicans in sight endorsed Lieberman and abandoned Schlesinger,
it became pretty much a 2-man race between L &amp; L.
</p></small>
<p>
Lost in the furor surrounding this &ndash;
which the US press kept remarkably silent about &ndash; was the fact
that in most of America Lieberman would not even have had the <i>option</i>
of pressing on as an
independent. 
According to Richard Winger in <a href="http://www.ballot-access.org">Ballot Access news</a>,
46 states have either
explicit "sore loser laws" or simultaneous filing deadlines making a
post-primary shift
impossible for any candidate other than a presidential one. 
<i>Only</i> Connecticut,
Iowa, New
York and Vermont allow such a loophole for "sore losers."
<small>
The previous 2 sentences were quoted from
Troy Schneider's <i>New York Times</i> op-ed 16 July 2006.
And in 11 states it is not permitted for anybody who is (or recently was) a member of
a political party, to run independent for any seat!
</small>
</p>

<p>
These laws are of course specifically designed 
to safeguard the two major parties from those annoying
"spoiler scenarios" of precisely this sort.  But &ndash; is that fair and democratic?
Lieberman, according to polls conducted in the very same week as his primary defeat,
actually had <i>more</i> support Connecticut-wide, than <i>either</i> Lamont
or Schlesinger!  <small>Later note: and he won the election! 
(But did he then propose
liberalization of ballot-access laws? <a href="LiebermanUPI.html">Not quite</a>.)
</small>
But under this sort of law, just because it was convenient for
party leaders to brand Lieberman a "sore loser," the most popular choice
of the voters would actually be <i>prevented</i> from running!   This is the
most undemocratic possible outrage!
</p>

<p>
Now there is a simple way that Connecticut
could now solve this "problem" while in fact increasing democracy &ndash;
adopt <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>,
in which the "spoiler" phenomenon and
"vote-splitting" both do not exist.
Would the "Democratic" party (which controlled both CT state houses, although
not the governorship)
try to do that, or would they try to abolish democracy by
ramming through a "sore loser law" for Connecticut?
</p>

<p>
The answer soon came.
(Elected Democratic) Connecticut Secretary of State
Susan Bysiewicz swam into this cesspit by
proposing to the CT legislature a new law
which would make it illegal for anybody who lost a primary,
from then being an independent candidate.
<a href="BiasedOfficials.html">Read more</a>
about Susan Bysiewicz as a member of the club of 
the US states' 
maximally biased election supervisors,
such as Katherine Harris in Florida 2000 and J.Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio 2004.

<H2> <a href="OneParty.html">One-party domination</a> via Ballot Access restrictions </H2>

<p>
Suppose one of the two major parties in a state gets weak.  The other party then
passes a highly restrictive ballot access law.  That means the weak party will
be able to get on ballot in comparatively few races.  That means it
will get weaker and the strong party stronger.  Pretty soon
we have pretty complete one-party domination.  
</p>

<p>
Think it can't happen?
Florida 1936: The Republican party failed to get 30% of the vote for a statewide office
(this was the era of Democratic one-party domination of the South)
therefore by Florida law was no longer a "political party."
Furthermore, the <i>only</i> way a political party 
could get <i>on</i> the Florida ballot at that point was to get at 
least 30% of the vote &ndash; which was always still theoretically possible
because Florida permitted "write in" candidates on ballots so that any voter
could vote for anybody in any race.  This of course was too ridiculous even
for Florida so they in 1937 lowered the 30% bar to 15%.
</p>

<p>
In Louisiana, nearly all voters were registered Democrat (it was pointless to be anything 
else since
the Democrats always won, therefore to have any voting power
whatever you needed to register Democrat so you could vote in their primary,
which effectively was the real election).
That prevented La Follette
from getting on ballot in 1924 because by law the signers of his petition had to be
entirely <i>non</i>members
of any other party.
</p>

<p>
Today, approximately one third of all state-house 
elections are unopposed one-candidate races.
</p>


<H2> <b>Q.</b> Would anything horrible happen if we just let anybody get on any ballot
just by asking? 
</H2>

<p>
<b>A<sub>1</sub>.</b> 
Not necessarily.
Arkansas had exactly that policy up to 1997.
The most US Presidential candidates Arkansas ever had on ballot was 13
(in 1996).
</p>
<p>
<b>A<sub>2</sub>.</b> But possibly.  The 2003
California Governor-recall race won by Schwarzennegger had
minimal requirements to get on ballot &ndash; and 135 people ran.
</p>
<p>
So we conclude that <i>some</i> requirements are necessary to stop there from being
ridiculously high numbers of contenders.
But not much.

<p>
In all US history since the age of preprinted ballots began (about 1890)
up to 2005, there have only been <i>two</i> cases where a 
ballot for some statewide office (or US presidential race)
has ever had more than 10 candidates on it,
<i>provided</i> at least 2500 signatures were required to get on ballot
(and even in those cases, there were &le;12 candidates).
