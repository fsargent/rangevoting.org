<H2> Instant Runoff fails to elect "most acceptable" candidate 
(who also happens to be a "beats-all" winner)
</H2>

<p><small> By Dave Ketchum (with light editing by W.D. Smith)</small></p>

<p>
<i>Governing</i> magazine published a piece 
(<a href="http://governing.typepad.com/ballotbox/2008/02/viable-third-pa.html">7 Feb 2008</a>)
about Instant Runoff Voting containing many inaccurate claims.
Here Ketchum refutes one of their more egregious errors.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
The article's claim that Instant Runoff (IRV) elects "the person who is
acceptable to the largest number of people" is false.
(That would, however, have been a correct
description of <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.)
</p><p>
Here is a counterexample:
</p
<table bgcolor="yellow" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#88ff88"><th>#voters</th><th>their vote</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>H>W>C</td><td>They would like to live where it is HOT</td></tr>
<tr><td>33</td><td>C>W>H</td><td>They would like to live where it is COLD</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>W>others</td><td> They like WARM, but neither HOT nor COLD</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Thus:
<ul>
<li>
A majority dislike HOT.
</li><li>
A majority dislike COLD.
</li><li>
All find WARM acceptable.
</li></ul>
IRV will discard the WARM voters and declare:
A majority of those we are still counting like HOT,
so <b>HOT wins.</b>
</p><p>
So IRV in this example elects HOT, even though the largest number
of people (100% in fact) find WARM acceptable.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>

<p>
Also, note that a 67:33 majority prefer WARM over COLD,
and a 65:35 majority prefers  WARM over HOT, so surely WARM is
the "true majority winner."
But nevertheless IRV refuses to elect WARM.
That also refutes the commonly-heard claim that IRV "elects true-majority-winners."
</p>

<br>
<p><small> The same false claim was repeated in, e.g,
<a href="http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/67/24552">this</a>
Steven Hill piece "Instant Runoff voting is catching on":
the false quote there is
"Instant runoff voting ensures that officeholders are elected with a majority of the vote."
This myth is traceable to he so-called "Center for Voting and Democracy" (where Hill was
a major actor) and unfortunately is often repeated.
