<H2> Top Ten Virtues of Range Voting </H2>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="MeaningOfVote.html">EXPRESSIVE:</a> 
You give information about <i>all</i> candidates not just one, 
and <a href="SmittyExp.html">QUANTITATIVELY</a> &ndash; not just who you prefer, but how much.
</li><li>
<a href="Honesty.html">ENCOURAGES HONESTY NOT STRATEGY:</a> 
Your score for candidate C in no way affects A vs. B battle.
So you can give your honest opinion of C without fear of &quot;wasting your
vote&quot; or hurting A.
</li><li>
Voter never has any incentive to vote someone over ("<a href="FBCsurvey.html">betray</a>")
his/her favorite.  (May sound like an obvious and easy criterion, but 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">very few other
voting systems obey it</a>!)
This should decrease the importance of <a href="RL2parties.html">cash</a>.
</li><li>
<a href="CandCloning.html">UNAFFECTED BY CANDIDATE CLONING:</a> 
If A has &quot;clones&quot; A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, that neither hurts nor helps them,
unlike in the old &quot;<a href=Plurality.html>plurality voting</a>&quot; 
system where the clones &quot;split
the vote&quot; and lose; and also 
unlike &quot;<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda voting</a>&quot; where a party
assures victory merely by running enough clones.
No more bitter emnity between alike candidates.
</li><li>
BREAKS 
<a href="Strangle.html">STRANGLEHOLD</a> 
OF  SELF-REINFORCING
<a href="Duverger.html">2-PARTY DOMINATION</a> 
SO VOTERS GET MORE CHOICES:
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a>  &amp; 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>  
voting <a href="TarrIrvSumm.html">yield</a> 2-party domination. Range voting experimentally yields
<a href="PsEl04.html">much greater support</a> for 3rd parties 
than &quot;<a href="rangeVapp.html">approval voting</a>.&quot;
Having more parties should also decrease the importance 
of <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>,
decrease  <a href="NonVoters.html">predictability
below 98%</a>, and increase
<a href="NonVoters.html">interest &amp; turnout</a>.
</li><li>
<a href="VMSumm.html">ANY VOTING MACHINE FOR MULTIPLE PLURALITY CONTESTS</a>,
i.e. all extant, can handle range voting.
(This for &quot;single digit&quot; range voting i.e. with scores
in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,X}.)
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> and
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a> voting can't say that.
</li><li>
If all voting is strategic, then
approximately 
(a) maximizes number of 
<a href="PleasantSurprise.html">
"PLEASANTLY SURPRISED"</a> voters and 
(b) <a href="AppCW.html">
ELECTS BEATS-ALL WINNERS</a> whenever they exist.
</li><li>
<a href="SPRates.html">FEWER</a> "<a href="SpoilExec.html">SPOILED BALLOTS</a>"
and <a href="LessFraud.html">LESS FRAUD.</a>
In <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting, an accidental hanging chad or overvote can cause your vote to
be discarded.  With range voting, a hanging chad causes
only <i>part</i> of your vote to get discarded
(converted to "blank") with the rest &ndash; your opinions of all the other candidates &ndash;
still operational.  There's no such thing as an "overvote" since expressing opinions
about <i>all</i> candidates is the <i>idea</i>; there's no wrong way to fill in a ballot.
RV also reduces risk of <a href="TieRisk.html">TIES</a>.
</li><li>
<a href="UniqBest.html">UNIQUELY BEST</a> 
among all common single-winner election methods as measured by
<a href="BayRegDum.html">BAYESIAN REGRET</a>. 
(Holds for all 720 tried combinations of the following:
number V of voters and N of candidates with V&gt;N&gt;2, 
several kinds of &quot;utility generators&quot;, several
amounts of &quot;voter ignorance,&quot; and
with either &quot;honest&quot; or &quot;strategic&quot; voters.)
</li><li>
<a href="UniqBest.html#HugePos">
HUGE POSITIVE IMPACT:</a> &quot;Democracy&quot; improved over monarchy and feudalism.
Bayesian regret measurements say just switching from plurality to
range will cause at least as much 
<i>further</i> regret reduction!
</li><li>
<a href="ApisMellifera.html">HONEYBEES</a>
&amp; <a href="LAlbipennis.html">ANTS</a>
have run <i>trillions</i> of elections over the last 20-50 million years
to make hive relocation decisions.  Under severe evolutionary pressure, they came up with...
range voting!
</li>
</ol>
