<H2> The politically incorrect (but perhaps actually correct) theory of why the IEEE abandoned "approval voting" </H2>

<p><small>By Stephen H. Unger, professor of EE/CS at Columbia University</small></p>

<p>
We should be careful about drawing conclusions from the IEEE use of
Approval Voting. It was initiated by the established power group in
order to reduce the chances of Irwin Feerst being elected
president. The situation was as follows: The IEEE Board of Directors
generally nominated 2 candidates for president. Candidates could also
be nominated by petition (and there were cases where petition
candidates won). Feerst was a smart, hard hitting man, who often hit
targets who deserved to be hit, and who was popular with rank-and-file
IEEE members. As a write-in candidate, Feerst once came very close to
winning an election and really scared the established group. They
feared that he might win because the anti-Feerst vote was being split
between the two B.o.D. nominees. Approval voting allowed many people
to vote for both B.o.D. nominees thereby reducing Feerst's splitting
advantage. This tactic did seem to work &ndash; although the fact that some
of Feerst's most vicious attacks were on other rank-and-file leaders
who he considered as competitors was also a major factor in his
failure to be elected IEEE President. The real reason Approval Voting
was terminated, was not because of any problem with it, but because
Feerst died so that the in-group felt it was no longer needed.

WDS: I've heard this theory from several IEEE members,  not just Unger.
So this, if not the truth, is at least widely believed.

Actually, I worked closely with Jack Nagel to get the IEEE to
adopt AV.  We tell the story in
<blockquote>
Brams and Nagel: "Approval Voting in Practice," 
Public Choice 71, 1-2 (August 1991) 1-17; and see also
<br>
Brams and Fishburn: "Going from Theory to Practice: The Mixed
Success of Approval Voting," Social Choice and Welfare 25, 2 (2005) 457-474.
</blockquote>
What you and Stephen Unger report about the IEEE's 2002 decision seems to
me accurate.  I add in my book, however, the following: "There may be
other reasons for the abandonment of AV, but I was not privy to such
information."
