<H1> Election (via approval voting) of UN secretary general </H1>

<p>
The Secretary-general of the United Nations is elected by a process with complicated
rules, but which in practice (since the complicated exceptions rarely arise) 
is essentially <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.
</P>

<h2>The election of Ban Ki-Moon in 2006</h2>

<p>
There were 15 countries voting, with the possible votes being "approve,"
"disapprove," or "no-opinion" on each candidate.   (But apparently the words "encourage"
and "discourage" were felt to be more diplomatic than "approve" and "disapprove.")
The votes were as follows (extracted from
<a href="http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170">http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170</a>).
Ban's vote was 14 encouraging and 1 "no opinion." The result indicates
that Ban was not opposed by any of the five
permanent members (P), which is important because they
have the power (if they choose to exert it) to <i>veto</I> anything the UN does, including if it
elects somebody Secretary General.
All five
remaining candidates received at least one discouraging vote from
permanent member(s):

The average number of approvals per ballot was 2.6=39/15.

<p>
Ban's election was then "confirmed" by the full General Assembly.  
[The setup is rather similar to 
the election (basically by 3-level <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>)
of the Doge in <a href="VenHist.html">Renaissance Venice</a>, followed by his confirmation 
(or, in theory, rejection) by
the assembly of the people.]

Incidentally, <a href="DonSaari.html#degenP">Donald Saari</a>
raised the fear that approval voting would in practice "degenerate" to 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.   This fear is seen, at least in
this high-stakes example, to have been utter garbage.

UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13 (IPS) -- Kofi Annan, a career U.N.
staffer and currently head of the United Nations' peacekeeping
department, will be the world body's next secretary general, the
U.N. Security Council confirmed today.
The 15-member Council approved Annan, a Ghanaian diplomat who
is undersecretary general for peacekeeping, by a <i>unanimous</i> vote in
a <i>secret</i> "straw poll" before formally voting to recommend him to
the 185-nation General Assembly as the next U.N. chief. The
Assembly is expected to vote Dec. 16 by consensus for Annan...
