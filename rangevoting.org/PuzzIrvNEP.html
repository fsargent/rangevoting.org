<H2> Answer to puzzle #?? &ndash; "Naive-exaggeration" strategy in IRV
</H2>

<p><b>Puzzle</b><br>
Consider this "<i>n</i>aive-<i>e</i>xaggeration" 
voting <i>s</i>trategy (NES):  rank the two frontrunners A&amp;B (where you prefer A&gt;B)
top &amp; bottom, then rank anybody you consider better than A co-equal top (or if
the rules of the voting system forbid that, then just below A) and rank
anybody worse than B co-equal bottom (or if that forbidden
then just above B)
and finally rank anybody between A&amp;B using honest normalized utility.
<br>
<b>A.</b>
Show that if &gt;75% of voters use NES strategy, then it is mathematically
impossible, with instant runoff (IRV) voting, for anybody besides A &amp; B to win.
However, if any amount <i>below</i> 75% of the voters employ NES strategy, then
it <i>is</i> mathemetically possible for an "underdog" C to win (albeit this may be unlikely).
<br>
<b>B.</b>
Compare this 75% threshhold with the corresponding threshholds for plain plurality
voting and for Condorcet and Bucklin voting.

<h3> Answers </h3>
<p>
<b>A.</b>
In instant runoff voting, if A gets 49.99%, B gets 25%, and C gets 25.01% of the
top-preference votes, then C can win if all of B's votes transfer to C
as second preference.    Here (49.99+25=74.99)% of the voters employed NES strategy.
</p><p>
However it is not possible for C to win if over 75% of the voters use NES.
Suppose without loss of generality that A gets at least as many top-preference votes as B.
If so, then either A gets over 50% (hence wins) or both A and B get over 25% each, while
meanwhile C gets below (100-75=25)%, hence C is eliminated and cannot win.
<p>
<b>B.</b>
With plurality voting the threshhold is 66.67% (more precisely 2/3).
If over 2/3 of plurality voters employ NES, then
one of {A,B} must get over 1/3 of the vote, while meanwhile any underdog C must get 
below 1/3 and hence cannot win.  But if only 66.66% of the voters use NES, then
it becomes mathematically possible for C to win,
because the votes could be A=33.33%, B=33.33%, C=33.34%.
</p><p>
With Bucklin and Condorcet voting, no such threshhold exists (or the "threshhold"
could be said to be 100%).   That is because, even if 99.99% of the voters
employ NES, it is still mathematically possible for the "underdog" C to win
if there is an almost-exact tie between A and B.  E.g. with either Bucklin or Condorcet,
if the top-preference votes are A=49.995%, B=49.995%, C=0.01%, and all A &amp; B voters prefer
C as their 2nd choice, then C wins.
