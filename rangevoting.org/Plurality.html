<H2> Plurality voting </H2>

<blockquote>
"Insanity" is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. 
&ndash; Albert Einstein

<p>
Also known as "first-past-the-post,"
plurality is by far the most common voting system for single-winner races.  
(Unfortunately.)
Your "vote" is the "name of a single candidate," and the most-named candidate wins.
</p>

<p>
Plurality is simple and easy to count, but its well-known pathologies include the 
"<a href="Glossary.html#spoiler">spoiler<a> effect," 
the "lesser-of-two-evils dilemma," "vote-splitting,"
and manipulability of
elections via 
"<a href="CandCloning.html">candidate cloning</a>."
Plurality also has the frustrating disadvantage that there is no way for a voter to express any
of his opinions about any of the <i>other</i> candidates, and it often is strategically best
for a voter to dishonestly  vote for somebody who is <i>not</i> his true favorite
&ndash; the system encourages lying. 
</p>

<p>
You then get a great choice between being a liar and being a fool.
(More amusing but equivalent wording: "artificial monopoly for the unpopular Republocrat party, 
with its ridiculous good-cop/bad-cop scam.")
</p>

<p>
With plurality voting, you can win without a majority &ndash; both Clinton and G.W.Bush 
won even though the majority voted against them. 
That means it's <a href="LoseAll.html">possible</a>
for most of the voters to get the candidate they 
like least!  (<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p24">Probability estimate</a> for how often that occurs.)
Plurality can in fact easily elect the candidate as "best" whom it would also decide is "worst,"
and its notions of "best" and "worst" can <a href="PlurBadRemove.html">reverse</a>
almost randomly (except that it <i>isn't</i> random, it is predictable, which is even worse
because that means these flaws can be manipulated).
</p>

<p>
<a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's Law</a>
is the observation that these problems of plurality result in self-reinforcing
two-party domination.  
Indeed, in the USA, plurality plus <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>
plus other effects has led to 
<a href="OneParty.html"><i>one</i></a>-party
<a href="Strangle.html">domination</a>!
</p>

<p> 
Once that happens, the remaining
two parties tend to become similar ("tweedledum and tweedledee")
because  it is strategically desirable for each to "grab the central ground."
That leads to even-further-reduced voter choice (beyond the reduction we already had 
from having only 2 parties)  and long periods of boredom.
However, the long periods of boredom are interspersed with exciting periods
of randomly directed and sometimes dangerous extremism, whenever one of the parties suffers
a vote split with a temporarily rising popular third party, causing the less-popular
and more extreme main-party competitor to be elected.
</p>

<p>
The  plurality system is so bad that (<a href="BayRegDum.html">computer simulations indicate</a>)
replacing it by <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> 
would improve society by a comparable or
greater amount than the entire invention of democracy in the first place.
