<H2> Instant Runoff Voting Has Not Increased Turnout in San Francisco </H2>

<p>
Proponents of Instant Runoff Voting commonly claim that IRV has the benefit of increasing 
voter turnout. Their logic is that with ordinary delayed (not "instant") runoffs, 
fewer voters tend to show up to cast votes in the decisive two-candidate runoff election.
</p><p>
However, analysis of the entire history of IRV elections in San Francisco reveals no increase 
in turnout. Actually it showed a <i>decrease</i> in turnout, albeit a statistically 
insignificant one.
One possible hyptothesis advanced in the media about why that is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Quote from 
<A href="http://www.sfweekly.com/2011-10-05/news/mayor-election-low-turnout-ed-lee-chris-roberts">Almost Nobody You Know Will Vote For the Next Mayor of San Francisco</a>
by Chris Roberts, <i>SF Weekly</i>, 5 Oct 2011:</b>
 Voter turnout was 
high in 1999, when the mayoral race broke down into easy, left vs. right 
lines. With ranked choice voting, a dozen candidates are asking for second 
and third place votes, and &ndash;
 as [USF professor Corey] Cook says &ndash; "there are a dozen shades of 
gray." Too much ambiguity reduces turnout, as does local media's handling of 
the top candidates. "The more that papers print that Ed Lee is a shoo-in," 
said a consultant working for one of Lee's chief rivals, "the less people 
are going to vote." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Warren D. Smith, a Princeton math Ph.D. who has been studying elections for over a decade,
explains as follows. 
[This analysis was excised and compiled 
by W.D. Smith and Clay Shentrup from a thread at the CES discussion forum on 
Google Groups with several contributors. Later David Cary pointed out a problem which
caused us to do some rechecking, correcting, and updating 
with new datapoint from year 2011.]

<h3>About Election Turnout in San Francisco pre- and post-IRV</h3>
</p><p>
San Francisco's first Instant Runoff (IRV) election occurred in November 2004, see 
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/evoting/2004-11-05-ranked-evote-snafu_x.htm">
http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/evoting/2004-11-05-ranked-evote-snafu_x.htm</a>
and other news sources.
The turnout percentages of election in SF are tabulated on the sfgov web site
<a href="http://www.sfgov2.org/index.aspx?page=1670">
http://www.sfgov2.org/index.aspx?page=1670</a>.
Here are the numbers.
<small><b>Warning:</b> The calculations below were
using 40% for the 2011 turnout based on press accounts,
but the correct value was later claimed to be 42.47% on the sfgov site.</small>
</p><p>
<b>I. SUMMARY:</b>
</p><table>
<tr bgcolor="aqua"><th>quantity</th><th bgcolor="pink">IRV era (Nov.2004 thru 2011)</th><th>pre-IRV old era (Nov.1960 thru March 2004)</th></tr>

<p>
Conclusion based on this: although the IRV era had lower turnouts, the difference's 
sign is not statistically significant. (There certainly is not evidence
IRV <i>in</I>creases turnout, at least not using this crude analysis.)
</p><p>
<b>II. THE RAW DATA PLUS SEVERAL ANALYSES:</b>
</p><p>
1. TURNOUTS IN THE IRV ERA (Nov.2004 thru 2011, data in reverse chronological order):
</p><center>
[42.47, 61.02, 34.72, 22.58, 28.07, 81.25, 40.22,24.88, 64.75, 35.62, 60.66, 37.11, 53.61, 74.31]
</center><p>
<!--
update:
http://sfappeal.com/news/2011/11/whats-at-stake-in-this.php
says turnout in 2011 mayor election electing Ed Lee was 
"about 40 percent of the 464,026 San Franciscans registered to vote. That's the 
lowest-ever turnout for a contested mayoral election... 
Turnout was 35.62 percent in 2007, when Mayor Gavin Newsom faced no 
serious opposition, and 45.67 percent in 2003, when Newsom and Gonzalez squared off.
-->

2. TURNOUTS IN THE OLD (PRE-IRV) ERA (Nov.1960 thru March 2004, reverse chronological order):
</p><center>
[42.51, 54.46, 45.67, 59.16, 38.38, 50.08, 34.15, 16.58, 29.62, 32.55, 66.59, 44.90, 48.84, 44.95, 55.85, 46.23, 30.41, 43.52, 61.97, 40.47, 46.56, 51.86, 55.40, 32.05, 37.21, 20.11, 69.01, 42.18, 50.73, 47.61, 57.78, 41.58, 44.84, 67.07, 48.33, 40.36, 51.18, 25.60, 39.71, 61.39, 39.65, 27.02, 70.39, 48.10, 45.99, 47.24, 63.38, 51.20, 25.22, 65.71, 34.79, 51.16, 51.91, 55.06, 57.25, 58.12, 51.75, 53.08, 73.11, 67.11, 66.42, 72.70, 61.95, 56.66, 60.00, 74.31, 63.75, 82.02, 85.03, 86.08]
</center><p>
<b>More sophisticated analyses:</b>
The above has been the simplest possible analysis.
However, reasons then came to our attention for considering various more complicated corrections
to it.
</p><p>
Jan Kok pointed out that many of the <i>mid-year</i>
elections before 1992 had very high turnout (we do not know why). November elections are usual, mid-year elections unusual.
</p><p>
Here is the data with mid-year elections <i>removed</i>. 
Again, the IRV era has lower turnout than the pre-IRV era, but this is now even less statistically significant.

Also note that in the above dataset the runoffs tend to have lower average turnout than both nonrunoff and IRV elections.
<i>But</i> 
Jan Kok then observed that <i>odd</i> years were quite different from <i>even</i> years. 
The runoffs in the odd years were in some cases higher than the main election! 
(Turnout was 2.8% lower on average.) And the average of all the odd-year runoff 
turnouts is greater than the average of the odd-year IRV turnouts (46.98 vs 37.27%).

approximately
which means turnout% was declining 0.385 per election, i.e. roughly 0.60 
per year, over the 45-year-long pre-IRV era, for a total turnout% decrease of 26.6%.
</p><p>
Going back to our original comparison

we could argue that to compensate for the time-declining trend (so that we can compare apples with apples, i.e. same-time to same-time), we should <i>subtract</i> 
half of the decline, i.e. 26.56/2=13.28 from the pre-IRV average number. 
(And call that 13.28&plusmn;1 to crudely estimate the error in the estimate of the decline.)
This would yield

<p>
This would now turn the tables and support the view IRV increases turnout &ndash;
except that again this is too small an effect to be statistically significant.
One could go further: one could argue that 0.60-per-year decline rate also ought to be
reckoned as continuing during the IRV-years also, which would upon adding 3.5 years of
further decline, further boost IRV's (decline-compensated) turnout advantage from
9.43&plusmn;5.38
to
11.53&plusmn;5.38
which would then be starting to become statistically significant (98% 
<a href="NormTble.html">confidence</a>
that the decline-corrected IRV turnout exceeds the decline-corrected non-IRV turnout).
Of course, to buy that you'd need to believe in this continuing decline and that 
it is occurring for reasons wholy unrelated to IRV versus non-IRV so that
it is valid to compensate for it when assessing the effect of IRV/nonIRV.  Obviously it
is mathematically impossible for the decline to continue forever (in either time direction)
and also the decline apparently actually accelerated (more than doubled?!)
after the switch to IRV...
so there is some reason to question both those assumptions...
so perhaps therefore we should only use <i>half</i> the decline-compensation,
not the whole ball of wax.  If so, the statistical significance vanishes.
</p><p>
So ok, I think we now have done enough analysis to reach a conclusion.
</p><h3> The conclusion</h3> 
<p>
The evidence from San Francisco up to 2011
does not yield a statistically significant conclusion at the 99% level that
IRV increases turnout, 
and also does not yield a statistically significant conclusion that
IRV decreases turnout. 
The effect, if any, is small and can be regarded using different analysis techniques as having
moved in either the positive or negative direction.
