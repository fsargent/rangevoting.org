<h2> Follow-up stories </h2>

<p>
Smith actually considers follow-up stories 2 and 4 to be objectively of greater importance
than the original story.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Not long after Rivest &amp; Smith,
cryptographer 
<a href="http://www.chaum.com/">David Chaum</a>
invented a new approach to simple secure voting he 
calls <a href="http://scantegrity.org/">Scantegrity</a> (<a href="ChaumST.html">our sketch</a>).
In at least some ways, it is <i>better</i> than the Rivest-Smith schemes:
it does <i>not</i> require trusted "magic" machines at the polling place, and allows voters
to vote normally.  
It also is fairly simple &ndash; although not as simple as Rivest-Smith and without
the "easy upgrade mix-in" property &ndash;
and can be implemented either with
or without cryptography.    The final word evidently has not been spoken about how
to make voting secure, but these techniques evidently open up a whole new world.

<p>
<b>2.</b> 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a>
has been used by <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a> for
millions of years.  Honeybees are by far the most experienced democrats on
the planet and <a href="http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/department/Faculty/seeley/seeley.html">
observations</a> and <a href="BayRegDum.html">simulations</a>
indicate that thanks to their use of range voting, they 
successfully get the best winner in elections, far more often than human voters do.
</p>

<p>
<b>3.</b> 
<a href="IrvExec.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a> has 
<a href="CFERlet.html">many flaws</a>
and is less-desirable, less-simple, and 
<a href="VMSumm.html">less-easy</a> to adopt than range voting.
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> 
Smith has invented a simple districting method, the "shortest splitline algorithm,"
that abolishes
<a href="GerryExec.html">gerrymandering</a>.
Ivan Ryan used US census data to produce <a href="SplitLR.html">pictures</a>
of how all 50 states would look with shortest splitline.
</p>

<p>
<b>5.</b> 
How might Rivest/Smith antifraud voting protocols impact current chaos in
<a href="EFraudKenya2007.html">Kenya</a>
and
<a href="PressPakistan2007.html">Pakistan</a>?
