<h2>  Does "utility" exist?</h2>
<p><small>by Clay Shentrup &amp; Warren D. Smith</small></p>
<p>
We've encountered a surprisingly large number of people who claim
"<a href="UtilFoundns.html">utility</a> does not exist"
&ndash; or that while it may exist for one person, it is invalid or meaningless 
to compare utilities between persons &ndash; or that while you can talk about one
person's preferring A over B ("ordinal preference"), it is invalid or
meaningless to quantify the <i>intensity</i> 
of such preferences.
</p><p>
If that is really their (un)belief, we have trouble understanding how those
people manage to survive and handle the challenges of everyday life. We
suspect they actually <i>do</i> believe in and use interpersonal numerical 
utility all the time, they simply don't realize they are doing so.
</p><p>
We are now going to give two quick arguments why quantitative multiperson utility is
a <i>necessary</i> idea &ndash; 
foolishly demanding it be ignored would hurt humanity hugely.
These arguments are not intended to be a "mathematical proof" nor intended to
be a complete discussion about utility arguments, concepts, axioms, and limitations.
They intend merely to provide a few quick insights.
</p>
<h3>  Revealed preference </h3>
<p>
The economic concept of
  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference" 
title="revealed preference">revealed preference</a>" 
is illustrated 
by the phrase "put your money where your mouth is."
E.g, if someone
claims  his dog is worth more than a million dollars, we could test his
sincerity by offering him a million dollars for the dog. 
For those who claim disbelief in  interpersonal utility  comparisons, we say:
"Would you prefer to
</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li> 
    deprive two people of their dessert, or
  </li>
  <li>
    deprive one of his next week of food."
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If you agree that the former option is more
  benevolent, then you are acknowledging  it is kinder to cause harm to
  <i>more people</i> if the 
  <i>intensity</i> of the harm is less, or at least acknowledging that
intensity can be interpersonally compared, and doing so can be important.
 <!--
We therefore implore you to accept interpersonal
  comparisons of utility, considering that not doing so would lead one to prefer
  the death of a single person over <i>any</i> amount of misfortune (no matter 
  how minor) to multiple persons.
-->

<h3>
  Ordinal utility: the Catch-22
</h3>
The preceding argument was intended to "call the bluff" of those who claim not
to believe in interpersonal comparisons of utility, but would betray that 
assertion if put to the test. But suppose we encounter that rare individual who
is still not convinced, and feels that intensity of individual utility is
irrelevant to evaluating <i>social</i> utility 
(overall utility for the group). In this case, the only thing we may consider
when making a decision for the group, is how
<i>many</i> in the group are helped or harmed &ndash;
severity simply cannot be considered. We now consider the purely
<i>logical</i> implications of this perspective,
putting ethical concerns aside.
<p> 
  If we consider only ordinal preference, then outcome Y can be said to be
  <i>socially preferable</i> to outcome X, if
  more people are benefited than harmed by a switch from X to Y. But this leads 
  to a logical paradox if we consider a
  <a href="http://CondorcetCycles.html" id="vt-r" title="preference cycle">preference
  cycle</a> ( i.e. Condorcet ambiguity).
</p>
<p>
  The moral is, whether you care to consider preference intensity or not,
  reality steps in and dictates that you must.

<h3>
  <a href="Mill.html">Lotteries</a>
</h3>
<p>
Which would you prefer for 1000 people?
</p>
<ol type="a"> 
  <li>
    10 people are killed while 990 are left alone
  </li>
  <li>
    200 are killed, but only with probability=p; otherwise all 1000 are awarded
    a bag of gold and magical cures for their current health problems.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
If you agree that the choice of which is better, depends on the precise value
of p (e.g. if p=100% or nearly enough, then the first choice is better; if p=0
or nearly enough then the second choice is better) &ndash; and if you agree your
choice of p depends on the precise kind of harm-or-help the people experience
(e.g. would be affected by replacing "200 die" by "200 lose a shilling" and/or
"bag of gold" by  "a peanut") &ndash;
then you've conceded that
some <i>quantitative</i> notion of utility for those 1000 people exists.
You seem to <i>need</i> numerical utility measures
to compare such choices sensibly in the presence of uncertainty ("probability p").
</p>
<h3>
  Were those realistic?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes. The first example is the sort of thing any judge, or lawmaker making laws
  about crime, needs to (or ought to) consider. The second is the sort of thing 
  everybody involved in a medical experiment needs to consider. Would you really
  prefer that everybody making these decisions ought to start with the view that
  he/she should refuse to think about utility or quantitative utility for 
  multi-person sets because that's invalid and meaningless??
