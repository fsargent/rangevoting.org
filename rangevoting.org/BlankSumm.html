<H2>
X's (or "blanks," or "no opinion" votes) &ndash; executive summary
</H2>

<p>
Permitting blanks is absolutely necessary to avoid mistreating
spoiled ballots. 
Namely, suppose you enter an illegible score in some candidate's slot. 
(Which probably would happen a few percent of the time.) Would you prefer that 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Your illegible score be interpreted as a "zero" thus maximally 
voting against that candidate (likely contrary to your intention &ndash;
if you wrote something illegible, it was probably not a zero),
</li>
<li>
Or should it be dropped from that candidate's average ("blanked"), thus not 
biasing it in any way? 
</li></ol>
<p>
Once we agree blanks are needed, we see they also have advantages.  You
can use them to express "no opinion."  If you were to write "0" 
(or any other number) that <i>would</i> be
expressing an opinion &ndash; in the csse of 0 that
that candidate is <i>very bad</I>.
X gives the ability genuinely to express <i>no</i> opinion &ndash;
if you vote X for Candidate Joe, then, as far as Joe's final score is
concerned, it is just as though you were not present in the
voting booth.  
</p><p>
A lot of voters want that
capability.  (And you still have the capability of giving Joe "0" if you want.
This is not taken away from you.)
</p>
<p>
There also is considerable evidence that in many elections for many candidates,
most voters know nothing (and many of them <i>want</i> to leave the decision about
that candidate to others).  
E.g. consider elections of 
<a href="JudgeElections.html">US Judges</a>.
</P>
<p>
There is also <a href="Blanks.html#dice">this argument</a> about "unbiased estimators."
