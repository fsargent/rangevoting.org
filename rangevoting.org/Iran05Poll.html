</P><P> In response to a question on who the respondents would personally
vote in the elections, 13.9 percent said they would vote for Hashemi

percent, Mehralizadeh at 0.8 percent, Ramezanzadeh, Rahami and

would vote for Rafsanjani in this round of elections have said that
they would vote for Karroubi in case Rafsanjani refuses to run for
