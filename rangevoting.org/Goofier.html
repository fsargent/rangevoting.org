<H2> The advantages of the ability of Range Voters
to express the <i>intensities</i> of their preferences </H2>


<table bgcolor="yellow" cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>Their Vote</th></tr>
<tr><td> 7 </td><td> <font color="red">C</font>>B>A </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 </td><td> <font color="red">B>A</font>>C </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> <font color="red">A</font>>C>B </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> <font color="red">B</font>>C>A </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In this 19-voter 3-candidate election example, 
<b>C</b> is preferred to every rival by majority ("Condorcet winner"),
i.e. beats A 10:9 and beats B 11:8.  (C also wins under Instant Runoff Voting.)
On the other hand, <b>B</b>
wins under <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> voting, AntiPlurality,
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a> or indeed any 
<a href="WtPositnl.html">Weighted Positional</a> system.
Finally, if the <font color"red">red</font> candidates are "approved" then
<b>A</b> is the winner under 
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> voting (9 approvals, beating B's 8 and C's 7).
</p>

<p>
Who really should win? Good question.
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>, since it permits voters to express
<i>quantitative intensities</i> of preference, can make a sensible decision in a 
situation like this.  In fact, with range voting, <i>any</i> of
the three candidates can win here, depending on what range scores the voters
award.  The other voting systems we've mentioned, since they <i>ignore</i> and never collect
any strength-of-preference information, really have no idea what to do.  They just
do not have the information they need in order to make a sensible decision.
