<H2> Colorado Felons in 2004 </H2>

<p>
Colorado Secretary of State Donetta Davidson, just weeks before the 2004 election,
removed 6000 "felons" from the voter rolls.  But there were a few problems with this step.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Federal law bars voter purges within 90 days of an election, so Davidson's move
was illegal, <i>except</i> she declared it was an "emergency" to do it, hence it
was legal.
</li>
<li>
By Colorado law, felons lose their vote 
only while actually <i>serving</i> prison time.  
No Colorado con has ever been known to vote while 
in prison.  So this was not exactly a suddenly necessary emergency move.
</li>
<li>
Conveniently for (Republican) Davidson, the list of felons was overwhelmingly Democratic.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Postscript: Davidson was rewarded for her efforts by being made chair of the
US federal "election assistance commission" in 2007.
