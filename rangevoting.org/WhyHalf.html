Why the 'half' cutoff in <a href="RuleD.html">rule d</a>? 
</H2>
<H3>How the precise wording of this rule evolved </H3>

<p>
Originally we suggested the criterion that 
to be elected, a candidate would need to have at least 50% numeric scores.
That is: you cannot be elected if more than
50% of the voters regard you as "unknown" and
hence vote "intentional blank" for you.
</p>

<p>
But that causes a problem:   If mutually-detesting
candidates A, B, and C have 26%, 26%, and 48% support
respectively, then the A- and B-supporters can conspire to all write "X"
(intentional blank) as C's score, preventing C from getting his deserved victory
and as their reward getting a 50-50 chance of electing either A or B.
(<font size="-1">They could also just agree to maximally support the other,
but that would not work in practice because each side would worry the other
one would renege on the deal.  In contrast, with the X-based deal we are suggesting here, 
neither side is motivated to renege.</font>)
</p>

<p>
That collusion problem is solved by changing "50%" to "33%" in rule d.
However, even then, a 3-way conspiracy among A-, B-, and C-supporters
could similarly deny a deserved victory to D.
That problem in turn is solved by further decreasing it to "25%."
</p>

<p>
A 4-way conspiracy could still work, but then this is becoming pretty ridiculously unlikely
so we are not going to worry about it.  
On the other hand,
if we decrease the threshold too much, it then becomes
too worrying to some that a "stealth candidate" unknown to most of society, could be elected.
We regard it, however, as ridiculously unlikely that anybody could be well known
to and heavily supported by 25% of the voters, <i>but</i> at the same time
the remaining 75% of the voters would know
nothing about him and all would want to write intentional blank scores for him
(with few or none wanting to give him a low score).
So "25%" seems like a good balance between these two bad possibilities which keeps
them <i>both</i> ridiculously unlikely.
</p>

<p>
So then our criterion was
that 
<blockquote>
a candidate, to be elected, must get at least 25% of the number of numeric
scores, as the candidate with the greatest number of numeric scores.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
But that phrasing has a flaw.
</p>

<H3> Flaw and rephrasing to avoid flaw </H3>

<p>
But then Abd ul-Rahman Lomax pointed out that 
<blockquote>
26% of the voters could
conspire to elect their candidate as a <i>write-in</i>
candidate not on the ballot. They write him in and give him the
maximum score.  Most voters would have given him the minimum score but
it did not occur to them to do so since he was not on the ballot.
This conspiracy candidate could beat even a well known on-ballot
candidate whose average
rating was 90% of maximum.
</blockquote>
Oops &ndash; that was a flaw in the 25% criterion.
Actually, we consider this flaw to be pretty unlikely (you could not organize
such a huge conspiracy without alerting the opposing teams so they could take 
countermeasures)
but it is worthy of note.
</p>

<p>
Our revised quorum rule, designed both
to blunt that attack and also to be a simpler rule,
is just 
<blockquote>
To win, a candidate must get at least half the score-sum as the candidate
with the greatest score-sum.
</blockquote>
This has an effect similar to the old 25% cutoff, but
is less vulnerable to the write-in-conspiracy attack.
</p>

<H2> Why the "sliding scale"? </H2>

<p>
By making the threshold depend on the candidate with the greatest score-sum
(or greatest number of numeric votes)
we create a sliding scale so that even in races where <i>no</i> candidate
is well known enough to get a lot of numeric scores, our criterion still does
something sensible.  I.e. at least
one candidate will always be electable.
(Just saying "25%" would have failed miserably in a race in which
<i>every</i> candidate got below 25% numeric scores &ndash; then <i>nobody</i> 
could be elected!)
