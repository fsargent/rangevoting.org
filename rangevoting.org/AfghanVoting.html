<H1> Lessons about Voting Systems from Afghanistan 2009 </H1>

<p>
The Afghanistan 2009 Presidential election recently attracted a lot of media attention due to 
its blatant fraudulence.   It was supposed to be conducted using 
plurality with additional top-two-runoff round if necessary.  In fact, there
was massive, blatant, obvious fraud evident to all external observers
and widely reported in the press both before, during, and after the election.
[We shall not give details since they have by now been widely reported 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_presidential_election,_2009">elsewhere</a>.]
</p><p>
H.Karzai declared himself victorious with over 50% "hence" with no need for a runoff.
However, under pressure from international observer groups and consequently the USA,
he later reconsidered and agreed to allow a runoff, i.e. essentially, admitting his fraud.
It seemed likely Karzai would
have won even with honest voting, and it also seemed likely that in the runoff
he would just re-fraud the 
election anyhow (this time more subtly).  His rival A.Abdullah therefore dropped out
of the runoff, claiming it was pointless for him to participate since he saw no way to
prevent such fraud.
</P>
<p>
Some voting systems are more susceptible to fraud (and when that fraud occurs anyway, it is
more obvious and easier to detect); some are less.
</P>
<ul>
<li>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
would have been a big mistake for Afghanistan which would have made the situation a lot worse.
The problem is IRV cannot be counted in precincts; there is no such thing as a "precinct subtotal."
It has to be counted <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">centrally</a>.
And in Afghanistan with no widespread internet
etc, it would <i>literally</I> have to be counted centrally, by Karzai's closest pals, in
Kabul.  
The advantage of precinct-based counting (and
the fact that precinct-subtotals <i>exist</I>) from
the standpoint of fraud, is that scrutineers can <i>compare</I> the centrally-claimed 
versus precinct-claimed subtotals.  The only ways to fraud the election are then 
<ol>
<li>
Fake a lot of  precinct subtotals &ndash; but this requires a large 
number of widely-geographically-separated conspirators, which makes the conspiracy less likely 
to succeed undetected.
</li><li>
Make the precinct and central counts disagree; then we instantly know somebody lied.
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The 2-round (non-instant) runoff Afghanistan actually had, or single-round 
&quot;<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>&quot;
(where each voter "approves" or "disapproves" each candidate, and the most-approved one wins)
both permit precinct countability.
Hence they both are preferable to IRV from the standpoint
of fraud.  They also both are <i>simpler</i> than IRV &ndash; key in a country like Afghanistan
with tremendous illiteracy.
<blockquote><small>
Before the war the literacy rate was estimated at 11.4 percent (18.7% male + 2.8% female).
In urban settings 25.9%  (35.5% male + 14.8% female) of the population six years old and over
were literate, but in rural areas only 8.8% (15.7% male + 0.6% female, 
in some provinces 0.1%).
</small>
</blockquote>
Unfortunately the 2-round system is bad because it <i>is</I> two rounds (a severe imposition
in a poor country like Afghanistan) and also, that clearly failed in the present case since
Karzai initally refused, and then Abdullah refused, to permit the second round.  
Just using the first
round alone (i.e. plain-<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting)
would also have been unnacceptable since it delivers results which, when there
are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_candidates_in_the_Afghan_presidential_election,_2009">41 candidates</a>, are almost random and hugely undemocratic.
</li>
<li>
For <i>multiwinner</I> elections where both <i>proportionality</I> of representation and 
<i>simplicity</I> of voting are paramount, we recommend 
F.Simmons' simplified form of
<a href="AssetSumm.html">asset voting</a>.
Again this is precinct-countable and very simple hence
would have been excellent for Afghanistan.
(The system Afghanistan actually used in 2005 to elect parliament was "single non-transferable 
vote."  In settings like Afghanistan, where e.g, they had a
46-candidate election, it leads to near-random
results of doubful legitimacy and quality as well as failing to satisfy a 
"proportionality theorem."
We see no advantages for that versus asset voting.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both asset, and plurality voting (as in the top-2-runoff system) and
<i>especially</I> approval voting permit
enhancement via <a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">Rivest-Smith antifraud</a> technology, which
although it would probably be too complicated for contemporary Afghanistan, could be a useful
idea to hold in reserve for the future.
</P>
<h2> Bottom line </h2>
<p>
Afghanistan has a lot of problems which may prevent it from becoming a successful democracy 
anytime soon.  But bad choices of voting system would severely-hurt that goal.
</P>
<ul><li>
Instant Runoff = big mistake for Afghanistan: too complex, enables fraud.
</li><li>
<a href="Approval.html">Approval voting</a>
(one round) and top-2 (non-instant two-round) systems: either are good ideas.
</li><li>
For multiwinner elections (like the Afghan parliament)
<a href="AssetSumm.html">asset voting</a> seems the clear choice.
</li></ul>
