RangeVoting.org - answer to puzzle 94:  The "YN model"
</title>

<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">


<H2>
Puzzle #94: The "YN model" &ndash; a simple voting model in which range voting behaves optimally
while many competing voting systems can behave pessimally
</H2>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b><br>
The "YN-model" is a simple model of voting
(with a fair amount of realism) in which range voting
performs optimally with "honest voters."  
There are <i>m</i> independent "issues"
and 2<sup>m</sup> "candidates"; each candidate announces
a clear yes or no stance on each issue, and by some benificent miracle we have a full
democratic marketplace, i.e, every possible issue-stance is
represented.  Hence (in the case m=4) we can name the 16 candidates YYYY
("yes" on all 4 issues), YYYN, YYNY,..., NNNN.
Suppose, for each voter, the <i>utility</i> of electing
any given candidate is just the 
<i>number of issues</i>
on which that candidate agrees with the voter.
Finally, we suppose without loss of generality
that all <i>m</i> issues each would win if put to a single-issue
yes/no vote, therefore the objectively best candidate is YYYY.
<small>The "without loss of generality" is because we could just 
rename the issues to make "yes" become "no" for that issue, e.g. the issue
"raise taxes?" becomes "do not raise taxes," so with such canonical
renaming we can always cause
the best candidate to be named YYYY.
</small>
</p>
<ol type="a"><li>
Prove that <b>range</b> voting, with "honest voters" (who always score their
favorite <i>m</i>, their least-favorite 0, and everybody else linearly-interpolated
between according to their utility) 
will <i>always elect the best</i> candidate in the YN model (i.e,
here, YYYY).
</li><li>
But show that <b>plurality</b> voting can
unambiguously elect the worst candidate (here NNNN)
while causing the best candidate (YYYY) to have <i>zero</i> votes.
</li><li>
Hence <b>Instant Runoff</b> (and <b>Coombs</b>), in such an election,
would fail to elect YYYY.  
Can IRV ever elect the worst candidate NNNN?
</li><li>
Show that <b>Condorcet Cycles</b> can happen in the YN model.
</li><li>
Show that all <b>Condorcet</b> methods (with honest voters)
can elect the worst candidate NNNN 
<i>and</i> can mis-order the finishers 
exactly backwards so that candidates with more Ns always are majority-preferred 
over those with fewer!
</li><li>
Show that <b>Borda</b> voting (with honest voters)
both can elect the worst candidate NNNN and order the candidates exactly backwards.
</li><li>
Show that <b>Approval</b> voting (with honest voters who approve the top F percent
of the available candidates and disapprove the rest, 
where F is any fixed value with 0&lt;F&le;50%)
can elect the worst candidate NNNN.
(And range voting can also do this with strategic voting.)
</li><li>
(Partially open) What about <b>Coombs</b> voting?  Can it elect the worst candidate NNNN?
</li><li>
What about <b>Copeland</b> voting?  Can it elect the worst candidate NNNN?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Comment:</b>
Most analyses of voting system "properties" ignore the fact  that "issues" exist and candidates
have stances on them.  The YN model is approximately the simplest and most natural 
possible voting model which <i>doesn't</I> ignore that.   It turns out that honest range voting
is always optimal in the YN model and is "self consistent."  But most other commonly
proposed voting methods
turn out to be both "self contradictory" and non-optimal (indeed they can
even behave pessimally)
in the YN model.

<h3> Answers </h3>

<p><b>a.</b>
With honest range voters, "Y" (on the first issue) can be regarded as
getting a 1-vote
or a 0-vote (for those voters who support or oppose issue #1), and ditto
for each other issue, as a contribution to each candidate's range score.
This view is mathematically equivalent thanks to our postulate the honest range voters 
linearly interpolate their range votes (between the best 
and the worst candidates getting the max and min
range votes) based on utilities.
Since we have postulated that Y beats N on each issue, the candidate YYYY beats every
other candidate.  In other words, range voting always delivers the best possible winner
in the YN model.
</p>
<p><b>b.</b>
Say 71% of the voters each have ideologies consisting of 71% Ys
(all such ideologies equinumerous)
while 29% have the NNN...NN ideology.
Then 50.4%=71%&sup2; of the voters prefer Y on any given issue, so by majority vote,
Y would win on each issue individually.
But NNN..NN is the plurality-vote winner with 29% of the vote,
while YYY..YY gets zero top-rank votes, and indeed every candidate besides NNN..NN gets
(in the m&rarr;&infin; limit) zero percent of the votes &ndash; sort of the 
ultimate in "vote splitting."
</p><p>
As a very concrete example of this kind of idea with m=4
(this election 
data was created artificially by S.J.Brams
for the purpose of solving this problem),
let the plurality votes for each candidate be as follows in a
31-voter, 4-issue, 16-candidate election 
</p>
<table bgcolor="aqua">
<tr><th>candidate</th><th>votes</th><th bgcolor="yellow">candidate</th><th bgcolor="yellow">votes</th>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><td>YYYY</td><td><b>0</b></td><td>YNYY</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><td>YYYN</td><td>4</td><td>YNYN</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><td>YYNY</td><td>4</td><td>YNNY</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><td>YYNN</td><td>1</td><td>YNNN</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>NYYY</td><td>4</td><td>NNYY</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>NYYN</td><td>1</td><td>NNYN</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>NYNY</td><td>1</td><td>NNNY</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><td>NYNN</td><td>1</td><td>NNNN</td><td><b>5</b></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Then on each issue Y beats N by 16 to 15.
(For example, just look at the first letter of each candidate's name to see Y on
the first issue wins by 16:15 over N.)
But nevertheless YYYY gets zero votes and NNNN
wins a plurality election
with 5 votes.
</p>
<p>
<b>c.</b> Instant runoff never elects a candidate with zero top-rank votes
(since it always eliminates that candidate in the first round).
<small>
Also Coombs eliminates the candidate (here YYYY) with the <i>most</i> bottom-rank
votes, hence cannot elect YYYY since it eliminates it immediately.
</small>
Unfortunately, IRV advocate Rob Richie once pronounced this an "advantage"
of IRV.  However, in the present example,
it is clearly a disadvantage, because the clearly best
candidate YYYY gets zero top-rank votes.
</p>
<p>
Who <i>is</i> elected in this election by IRV? 
In this example IRV experiences many difficulties with
tied round results. If we pretend/assume that the votes somehow get transferred equally in
all tied-directions (and start with the above example multiplied by 10), 
then we'd arrive, at an intermediate stage in the IRV process, at this situation
</p>

<table bgcolor="aqua">
<tr><th>candidate</th><th>votes</th></tr>
<tr><td>NYYY</td><td>55</td></tr>
<tr><td>YNYY</td><td>55</td></tr>
<tr><td>YYNY</td><td>55</td></tr>
<tr><td>YYYN</td><td>55</td></tr>
<tr><td>NNNN</td><td>90</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
and then the tie would be broken randomly with the result that
one of the four Y<sup>3</sup> candidates would win.
</p>
<p>
More detail:
Abd ul-Rahman Lomax manually constructed the full honest-vote rank-orderings
in the Brams example
(we assume each voter rank-orders the candidates in descending order of the number of
issues on which they agree with that voter.  There could be ties in which case Lomax
broke them according to his personal whim):

<p>
and then upon working through this election with
<a href="http://cec.wustl.edu/~rhl1/rbvote/calc.html">Rob LeGrand's ranked-ballot calculator</a>
we confirm that YYNY
indeed wins with IRV. 
<small>
NNYY won with Coombs' method.
Also
with honest <i>Bucklin</i> voting YYYY wins (although if the
Bucklin voters vote
"strategically," Lomax says NNNN wins).
YYYY also wins with honest Borda and honest Condorcet voting
using either Tideman ranked pairs, Schulze beatpaths, Nanson, Simpson-Kramer min-max, Copeland,
and basic Condorcet.

It also is possible (in other situations) for IRV to elect the worst candidate NNN...NN.
The idea in answer (e) will usually do that if <i>m</i> is large enough,
and we throw in enough NNN...NN voters to make sure that NNN...NN does not
get eliminated in an early round for having zero top-rank votes,
and we randomly pre-perturb the vote-counts slightly to break ties.
(And a fully explicit example with 83 voters will be given in answer "e" below.)
<!-- I currently am unsure what the simplest "IRV-elects-NNNNN" example is.-->
</p>

<p><b>d.</b>
The YN model with m=6 can exhibit a Condorcet cycle
among the three candidates named<br>
YYNNNN, NNYYNN, and NNNNYY.<br>
This will happen if there are three equinumerous types of voters whose
ideologies are<br>
YYYNNN, NNYYYN, and YNNNYY.
<!--
(Condorcet cycles also are possible when m=3 by using the 
same idea in a slightly more complicated way now using six voter-types:
the three candidates are YNN, NYN, NNY
and the 6 voters are
YYN, NYY, YNY, YNN, NYN, NNY.)
NO??!!!  
-->
</p>

<p><b>e.</b>
<!--
We claim YYYY is a beats-all "Condorcet winner."
Try to prove by induction on m.
Obviously it is true if m=1.
Compare YYYY...Y (name m letters long)
with some other candidate featuring k "N"s in its name.
By induction, YYY...Y is preferred over this other candidate by a 
voter-majority, if 1&le;k&lt;m. 
So the only thing we need to complete the proof is that YYY...Y is preferred over NNN...N
by a voter-majority. But no!
-->

If 70% of the voters each have ideologies consisting of 70% Ns
(all such ideologies equinumerous)
while 30% have the YYY...YY ideology, then the worst candidate NNN...NN is majority-preferred
over the best candidate YYY...YY.
(Note 49%=70%&sup2; of the voters prefer N on any given issue, so by 51-49 majority vote,
Y would win on each issue individually.)
</p><p>
At first I thought this meant NNN...NN was the Condorcet winner, but 
actually, that is not the case;
NNN...NNY (with just a single Y) pairwise-beats NNN...NNN!
Still, I think NNN...NNN wins with the Simpson-Kramer minmax Condorcet method?
(And which others?)
</p>

Simplest exaple is m=7??!!!

we find that Y wins on issue #1 by 42-to-41 majority (and ditto for any other issue).  
But NNNN is the election winner
using either Basic Condorcet, Schulze beatpaths, Tideman Ranked Pairs, Nanson-Baldwin,
Simpson-Kramer min-max, Bucklin, or IRV.
(But NYYY wins with Black and Borda and YYYN wins with Copeland. Again Coombs elects YYYY.)
<p>
Later note: see answer i for a complete solution to the Condorcet-method problem,
which works for <i>every</i> Condorcet method, not just the named-methods we mentioned above.
</p>
<p><b>f.</b>
The same example that led off answer (e) also yields that NNN...NN is the Borda winner 
(if <i>m</i> is large enough).
To be ultra-concrete about it, with m=4 take 21 YYYY voters versus
10 each for YNNN, NYNN, NNYN, NNNY (and use Borda score
<i>expectation value</i> among random honest orderings of the candidates); then 
the unique Borda winner is NNNN
even though any individual issue is won by Y by a 31-to-30 majority.
</P>
<p>
[Our more-powerful "backwards Condorcet" example in (i) will also yield a backwards Borda ordering
because of the fact that a candidate's Borda score is the sum of his pairwise-victory margins,
up to an overall additive constant.]
</p>
<p><b>g.</b>
The same example in (e) also yields that NNN...NN is the Approval Voting
winner (if <i>m</i> is large enough)
for <i>any</i> fixed value of F with 0&lt;F&le;50%.
<small>
Also, of course, the Brams m=4 example for plurality voting is also valid
for approval voting if the voters only approve their top choice, i.e. the top 1/16 of the
candidates.  
In that example Lomax also notes that voters approving only their favorite if
he is a "frontrunner" but approving both their favorite and successive candidates worse than
him until they reach a "frontrunner"... will sadly still elect NNNN
if we regard "frontrunners" as those with 4 or more plurality votes.
Further, in the 61-voter concrete m=4 example in answer "f",
if voters approve the top 5 candidates, then NNNN wins with 40 approvals; no rival
gets more than 30.   Also we note that <i>range voting</i> can elect NNNN if
the voters are <i>strategic exaggerators</i> rather than "honest," i.e. if we assume they
vote in "approval style."   Also, if voters have different strengths of feeling,
e.g. if the NNNN voters were extra passionate (this differs from the utilities
assumed in the problem statement), then range can elect NNNN, albeit
in that case this might be "good behavior," not a "malfunction."

In the election example that began answer b,
Coombs begins by eliminating YYY..YY because it has the most bottom rankings (29% of the voters
rank it bottom, far more than for any other candidate).
Coombs (assuming random tie-breaking in who-to-eliminate decisions)
then continues by eliminating candidates with fraction-F of "Y"s in their names, 
where F gradually decreases from 100% down to 71% and continues down toward 
0 (it gets arbitrarily near to 0 if m is sufficiently large).
Eventually we reach a situation where only a few candidates remain, all of them with
almost-all "N"s in their name, and one wins.
This <i>almost</i> solves the problem because the 
winner will have an arbitrarily large fraction  (below 100%)
of "N"s in its name &ndash;
but does not completely solve the problem because we have not proved
it is NNN..NN itself.
If m is sufficiently large, then NNN..NN will be
ranked bottom &ndash; in a head-to-head 2-candidate race between NNN..NN and
NNN..NNY with just a single Y, or any very small fraction of Ys, in
the latter name &ndash; by at least 50.4% of the voters, hence will be eliminated.
That proves NNN..NN <i>cannot</i> be the Coombs winner.
So this election almost, <i>but</i> not quite, solves the problem.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, in this election note that Coombs eliminates almost all candidates
in exactly backwards order, i.e. starting by eliminating the best candidate YYY..YY,
and thus "outputs a rank ordering" of the candidates which is almost exactly the reverse
of the order that "should" be output!

Let 51% of the voters have ideologies which are 49% Y.
The remaining
49% of the voters have ideologies which are 60% Y.
(All such ideologies equinumerous.)
Then Y beats N on every individual issue.
Now compare a candidate with fraction-P of Ys in its name, versus
a candidate with fraction-Q of Ys in its name, P&lt;Q.
The former candidate is preferred arbitrarily-near-unanimously within
the 51%-bloc of voters, hence by an overall majority, if 
0.49(1-P)+0.51P&lt;0.49(1-Q)+0.51Q
[since
these formulae give the expected number of letters-changed between the voter and the candidate
for a random voter in the 51% bloc, and the distribution becomes arbitrarily sharply peaked about
its expectation value in the m&rarr;&infin; limit]
i.e. if
P&lt;Q.
Therefore, a candidate with fewer Ys in its name, is always majority-preferred
over one with more Ys in its name!
[Actually, the same analysis also works for the 49%-voter-bloc too, but in reverse, so that
we see that the majority preference here is always a 51-49 majority to within &epsilon;.]
Hence NNN..NN is the Condorcet winner and there are no cycles.
This proves that not only Copeland, but in fact <i>every</I> Condorcet voting method,
will elect the worst candidate NNN..NN and will order the finishers in exactly the reverse
of the "right" ordering. 
Indeed every voting method based purely on the "pairwise matrix" will get everything
totally backwards. 
</p>

<p><b>Final comment.</b>
This answer is almost perfect for theoretical purposes, i.e. it almost totally settles the 
worst-case behavior of all the most-common voting system proposals in the YN model.
However, because fairly large <i>m</i> values seem needed to make the examples work (?),
and because we <i>are</i> talking about worst case behavior which is rare (?), these
pathologies all may have little <i>practical</i> interest.  
</p>
<p>
It therefore is of interest also to examine the YN model for <i>random</i> voters.
That will be the subject of a <a href="PuzzAggregRandom.html">different</a>
puzzle.
