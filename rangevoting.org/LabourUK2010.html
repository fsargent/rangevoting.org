The Election, by Instant Runoff Voting, of UK "Labour Party leader" in late-September 2010 
</H2>
<p><small>By Jim Riley, Ivan Ryan, Warren D. Smith</small></p>

<p>
Ed Miliband won.
</p><p>
The purpose of this page simply is to summarize the available data about this election, since
it was one of the most-important elections (perhaps even <i>the</i> most important)
conducted with IRV (<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>) 
up to that date.  
The 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election,_1994">preceding</a> 
election on 21 July 1994 (after the unexpected death of leader John Smith)
had been conducted using
plain-<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, not IRV, and had elected Tony Blair with 57.0%
of the weighted vote, defeating John Prescott (24.1%) and 
Margaret Beckett (18.9%).  
The weightings were the same in 1994 and 2010, just the algorithm for using
those weighted votes to determine the winner changed.
(There also was an "election" in 2007, but not really &ndash; Gordon Brown ran unopposed
since nobody else succeeded in surpassing the "nomination" hurdles.)
From a voting-theory point of view both 1994 and 2010 seem to have been rather boring.
In 1994, Blair got 52.3%, 58.2%, and 60.5% in the three voter sections.
In 2010, it similarly 
appears virtually every system ever seriously proposed by mankind would
also have (with the same weighted set of voters) elected Ed Miliband, <i>except</i> for
the previous plain-<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> system, which would have elected his 
brother David.
</p><hr><p>
There were 5 candidates, &asymp;338000 voters, and 4 televised debates.
The winner with plain plurality would have been (Ed's older brother and former
foreign secretary) David Miliband, who indeed led in every round except for the final round
which was Ed 50.65% vs David 49.35%.
Eliminated in this order were: Diane Abbott, Andy Burnham, Ed Balls, and David M.
There were 3 classes of voters:
</p>
<ol><li>
Labour <b>MPs and MEPs</b>.
</li><li>
Dues paying <b>Labour Party members</b>. It appears turnout was about 63% among
this group of &asymp;200000.  The best turnout was 76.6% of the 1200 Labour members in
Hornsey &amp; Wood Green and the worst was 35.5% in
Luton North.
</li><li>
<b>Affiliated unions and societies</b>. Roughly 10% turnout of around 3 million or
so members.
In particular, according to the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>: "Unite the Unions"
(the biggest affiliate) 
distributed over a million ballots but only 10.5% of them voted
and  15202 of those ballots were <a href="SPRates.html">spoiled</a>
(which suggests there was about <b>15% spoilage</b> in section3, an enormous rate).
At least one of these unions/societies distributed the ballots <i>accompanied</i> 
by a recommendation to vote for Ed Miliband; these recommendations may have been enough
to bring him his victory.
</li></ol>
<p>
The three kinds of votes were weighted so that each section
had an equal share of the total weight.
This caused each of the 266 voters in section1 to be equivalent to &asymp;794 section3 votes.
David won in both section1 and section2 alone, but Ed's win in section3 was large enough,
despite the low weights of the section3 votes, to carry the day in the final IRV round.
</p>
<p>
The election appears to have been nonpathological.
Ed Miliband apparently would also have
won (with these weighted voters) using range or Borda or Condorcet voting, although
David Miliband was the plain-plurality voting winner.

<p>
There definitely was "ballot truncation" (whether intentional or not)
since in "section 3" the total #ballots
was
</p><pre>
Round....total(sec3).....total(sec2)
1..........211234.........126874
2..........206640.........126312
3..........205283.........125186
4..........199671.........122806
</pre><p>
hence at least about 6% of the voters in sec3, and similarly 
at least 3% of those in sec2  truncated.  Actually there was considerably more truncation 
than these lower bounds, see below.
</p>
<p>
The election looks like it was 2 front runners and 3 minor
candidates. All the minor candidates added together got 27.9% of the weighted top-preference
vote, which is less than the 34.3% and 37.8% for the two Milibands.

<h3> The 266 section1 ballots, published by <i>Manchester Guardian</i> </h3>
<p>
The full set of the 266 rank-order
ballots in section1 was made public by the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>.
They were cast by Labour MPs and MEPs.
The table below has 6 columns.  Example row:
<pre>
     "4	Ms H Alexander MP 	*	*	1	2	3"
</pre>
means "Ms H.Alexander MP" (who was voter #4)
cast a ballot ranking Andy Burnham top, David Miliband 2nd, Ed Miliband 3rd,
and leaving Diane Abbott and Ed Balls both unranked.

<blockquote>
<b>Edited Comment by Rob Richie:</b>
Ed Balls and his wife Yvette Cooper
both "bullet voted" for Balls;
Abbott and John McDonnell both bullet-voted
for Abbott; these 4 were the only voters of the 266
who left both Milibands unranked.
McDonnell had actually tried to run for labour leader himself but had dropped out.
</blockquote>

<p>
These 266 voters, since they all were MPs or MEPs and since they presumably all (or nearly)
actually were personally acquainted with each of the 5 candidates, were presumably far more
motivated and knowledgeable voters than an average British citizen.
</p><p>
There were the following numbers of preferences expressed by these 266 voters:
</p><pre>
        61 (gave 1 preference), 60 (gave 2 preferences), 24 (3), 26 (4), 95 (5).
      [Average number of candidates ranked=3.13; and 3.23 if count 4 ranked as "really" being 5.]
</pre><p>
Ranking 4 candidates was equivalent to ranking all 5 as far as the IRV
algorithm was concerned since it treated unranked candidates as
ranked co-equal last; 26+95=121=45.5% of these 266 voters
thus <i>effectively</i> ranked all candidates.  The remaining 
145=<b>54.5% of these voters "truncated."</b>
Note that 61, i.e. <b>22.9%, of these voters "bullet voted,"</b> i.e. maximally truncated by
ranking only a single candidate.
</p><p>
The ballots of 4 (1.5%) of the 266 sec1 voters had no impact on the crucial final round
since these 4 ballots each left both Milibands unranked.  That 1.5% compares with
5.5% among the sec3 voters (ratio 3.67) and 3.2% among the sec2 voters (ratio 2.13).
This suggests that "bullet voting" and "truncation" rates both
were probably substantially greater
among sec3 voters
(who are more representative of the average British voter) than the 22.9% and
54.5% rates among sec1 voters.
</p><p>
In fact, if we <i>model</i> the ballots as being of two types &ndash; "truncated" and "full"
(and counting 4-rank ballots as "full") then if we assume the sec3 voters acted the same 
as the sec1 voters except for altering the relative fractions of these two ballot types &ndash;
then we would find that the ballot truncation rate among sec3 voters had to be 3.67 times
the 54.5% rate among the sec1 voters, i.e. 
<b>this model would yield 200% and 115% ballot truncation 
rates for sec3 and sec2 voters!</b>  
Of course, these are impossible, which means the model was incorrect or the ratios
"3.67" and "2.13" were heavily contaminated by statistical noise (or, more likely, both).
Still, this is enough that it seems seems safe to deduce that the
truncation rate was <i>extremely high</i> among
average British voters.  Noting (as did Rob Richie above) that
all 4 of the sec1 ballots that left both Milibands unranked were "bullet vote"
ballots, if we <i>model</i> by assuming &asymp;100%  of ballots in all
sections leaving both Milibands unranked were bullet votes, and regard ballots as
either "bullet" or "not" assuming ballots in sec3 were statistically 
identical to ballots in sec1 aside
from changing the relative fractions of the two ballot types &ndash; 
this approximate 
model again would lead to the conclusion that the bullet-vote percentages in sec3
and sec2
were respectively 3.67 and 2.13 
times sec1's 22.9% rate, i.e. <b>84%  and 49% bullet-voting rates (extrapolated)</b> among
the sec3 and sec2 voters.   Again, these estimates are very noisy, but still it
seems safe to say the true bullet-voting rates were very large.
</p><p>
A different estimation can be based on the fact (which we can tell from the official data)
that 
<b>28.5%</b> of the 7, 
<b>6.0%</b> of the 9314,
and
<b>17.7%</b> of the 25938
<i>Abbott-top</i> voters in sec1, sec2, and sec3 respectively
<b>cast "bullet"-style ballots</b> (i.e. ranking Abbott <i>only</i>).
Evidently Abbott-top voters were less likely to "bullet vote" than random voters,
probably because they knew she was doomed to lose, so a bullet vote for her was a wasted vote.
</p><p>
Roughly 70% of those ranking both
(I have not computed it exactly) ranked David &amp; Ed Miliband <i>consecutively</i>,
i.e. they were not "clones" in the sense this was below
100%, but they were clones to a considerable degree.
</p><p>
David Miliband and Ed Miliband were ranked by 213 and 209, of 266 sec1 voters, with
average rankings of 1.75 and 1.90 respectively. 
Ed Balls was 159 and 2.52; Andy Burnham was
146 and 2.95; and Diane Abbott was 150 and 4.46.
Thus David Miliband was also the range/Borda voting winner (among these 266 ballots)
if these ballots are treated as range-voting style.
He also was the approval-voting winner, if "ranking" vs "not ranking" is regarded as "approval"
vs "disapproval."
</p><p>
David also was the plain-plurality voting winner (in sec1) and
the "Condorcet winner"
defeating every rival pairwise.
(E.g. in the next-closest pairwise battle,
DM beat Ed Balls 166:64, namely 95:47 if exclude blank scores and 71:17 among 
those ranking exactly one of the two candidates.)  Since we know from the official 
final round count that
Ed Miliband beat DM
pairwise among the full set of weighted votes, and considering the huge margins of pairwise 
victory for the Milibands versus non-Milibands in sec1, it seems clear that
Ed Miliband was a "Condorcet winner."
</p>

<h3>"Strategic Nomination" manipulation attempt?</h3>
<p>
Abbott was actually <i>nominated</i> by David Miliband, enabling her to enter this race!
What are we to infer from that move by DM?  At the time some declared this a strategic 
masterstroke because of the theory that somehow Abbott's presence in the race would
hurt Ed Miliband's vote-count, thus causing David to win.  
But afterward others speculated that somehow the move
had backfired to actually make David lose the election!   All such speculations rest on
the mathematical fact that IRV has the property that if some losing candidate is removed
from all IRV ballots, that can alter the IRV-winner.
For example, in <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington's</a> 2009 mayoral election 
(conducted using IRV), if
Wright had dropped out of the race, that would have changed the winner from Kiss to Montroll.
That phenomenon <a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">happens</a>
in 12.2%, 9.2%, and 19.4% of random 3-candidate IRV elections
(in 3 different probability models),
and in
23.3%, 33.8%, and 22.2% of random 3-candidate IRV elections
<i>in which the plurality and IRV winner differ</i> (as they did here;
same 3 probability models).
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a>
cannot exhibit that mathematical flaw &ndash; although it still can
if the range votes are "rescaled"
after the drop-out &ndash; hence presumably is more-immune than IRV to
such "strategic nomination" manipulation attempts.
</p><p>
To analyse the question in this particular election: because Abbott
was the <i>first</i> candidate IRV eliminated, 
her presence or absence did not affect the winner
from the given vote-set &ndash; the mathematical 
phenomenon can only arise for <i>later</i>-eliminated losers.
So the only way it could have affected things was by affecting <i>who voted</i>.
If Abbott's presence attracted Abbott-voters to the polls
who otherwise would not have voted, then
her presence appears to have helped Ed Miliband (as we see from the vote-transfers after the 
first IRV round), and probably enough to
tip the election (i.e. the backfire-theory is correct).
Note that this is <i>exactly the opposite</i> of what would have happened in a plurality-voting
election &ndash;  <i>then</i> DM nominating Abbott really <i>would</i>
have been an anti-Ed masterstroke.
</p><p>
But on the other hand, if Abbott's presence attracted Abbott-<i>hating</i> voters to the polls
who otherwise would not have voted, then we don't know.   It is difficult to make
speculations about this sort of thing without very specialized kinds of poll data.
We do not have that data, although perhaps one of the Milibands did.

This poll would have wrongly
predicted Andy Burnham would win based on approval/disapproval ratio, but
rightly 
predicted Ed Miliband's victory based on total approval count.
Note that Burnham with only 8.68% of the top-preference votes in the official election
would still have been unable to beat either Miliband even if their top-preferences were 
each divided by 3 (and the same is true of every IRV round).
Also, even if Burnham &amp; Abbott had magically merged into a single supercandidate,
he/she would still have been unable to beat either Miliband in any IRV round even if
the Miliband's votes magically got divided by 2.
So I think we must conclude based on the total evidence that Burnham would <i>not</i>
have won
if this election been approval voting &ndash; 
<i>even</i> if we speculate those approval voters
would have artificially diminished their Miliband votes due to 
strategy vis-a-vis the inter-Miliband rivalry.  
(And Ed Balls was a huge loser in this approval-style poll, suggesting he also would
have had no chance.)
In that case, this poll merely adds more support
to our view/speculation that Ed Miliband still would have won with approval voting.
