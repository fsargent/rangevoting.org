RangeVoting.org - many choices paradox and range voting (ludicrous objection)

<H1> Having many choices is bad? </H1>

<h3> Here is a criticism of <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
that was actually made
by some well known voting-reform people and "experts"
whom I shall generously
leave nameless: </h3>

<p>
"At a theoretical level, it is well known in game theory and social-
choice theory that a larger menu of choices do not necessarily lead
to better decisions, even when there is complete information.
Indeed, additional choices often render a system more vulnerable to
manipulation, especially by sophisticated players...
</p>

<p>
Even 10 levels
is asking a lot of voters, who--psychological experiments show--
generally cannot make such fine discriminations.
We do not say that 2 levels
is always perfect--3 may be better in some instances..."
<!-- --but we think
it is a good starting point for most citizens, including the 50%
who cannot name the Vice President. -->
</p>

<h3> Here is my response to that nonsense: </h3>

<p>
Yes, having too many choices can be bad.
But more often, having too <i>few</i> choices is what is bad.
Well, <i>why</i> is too-many bad? For three <i>reasons</i>: (1) you do not have enough
time to consider them all and hence are prevented from making a decision at all, or (2)
you are prevented from making a good decision, or (3) you are ignorant
about some aspects of the choice and hence would prefer not to be forced to guess
about those aspects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b>  The Bush administration
drug plan for seniors caused those seniors to have to consider 
over a hundred
different "plans" they could select, written in legalese and advertising-ese.
</p>

<p>
<i>However</i>,
none of these three reasons occur in range voting.
Nobody is prevented from range-voting and range-voting well,
because of their choices.
If you increase the range from 0-9 to <a href="Why99.html">0-99</a>
on a 7-candidate ballot,
people do not say "Holy cow, my number of possible choices is
now 10<sup>14</sup>, I am so helpless, I cannot consider them all,
I cannot even vote or hope to make a good vote."  No.  They simply
instantly write down their numerical scores and are done with it.
We've tried it many times.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, range voters have the option of <i>intentionally</i> expressing ignorance
or "<i>no opinion</i>" by leaving a candidate's score <i>blank</i> in which
case that candidate's election result will not be affected by that voter.
A lot of voters who are ignorant about a candidate prefer to do that.  
An apparently even larger number prefer to put "zero" as that candidate's score,
thus "playing it safe" about unknown candidates.  Another 
(apparently smaller) set of voters prefer to give unknowns an intermediate score
like 35.  All three choices are possible, and almost all voters decide how they want to
play it in a matter of seconds, with nobody taking more than a minute.
</p>

<h3> And another point: </h3>

I happen to know that the people who issued that quote, all believed that 
2-party domination was bad and wanted voters to have more than 2 viable candidates
to choose from so that their country could become more democratic!

<a name="hot"></a>
<h3> Experimental refutation: </h3>

<p>
This one surprised even me.  It turns out that people actually vote <i>faster</i> with
range voting (1 to 10 scale) than with <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>
voting (APPROVE versus NOT 2-way choice)!!
</p>

<p>
I got this from William Poundstone's book (Hill &amp; Wang, Feb. 2008) 
<a href="PoundstoneRev.html">Gaming the Vote</a>.
Poundstone interviewed <a href="HotOrNotReplica.html">Hot or Not</a>
co-founders James Hong &amp; Jim Young.
Hot or Not is a cult-favorite website
in which you can rate members of the opposite (or same!) sex "hot" (10) or "not" (1)
or anywhere in between &ndash; i.e. <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
(You can also do other things, like submit your own photo &ndash; vanity central &ndash;
or pay to join a matchmaking service.)
So far, there have been over <i>12 billion</i> votes cast on Hot or Not, which 
is far more votes than in all US presidential elections. Combined.  All time.
</P>
<p>
Enough data for you?
</p>
<p>
They originally were worried than maybe scoring people on a 1-to-10 scale was
going to take too long, which would repel customers.   
So they tested simpler schemes where you just had 
two buttons: "hot" or "not."  
They also tested another scheme where you saw two people at once,
and pressed a button indicating who's hotter.
</p>
<p>
Guess what?   It took the raters <i>longer</i> to make a less-informative decision!
So Hot or Not abandoned both 2-choice vote schemes and went with the 10-point scale.
<blockquote>
"Sometimes people can't even express the number," said Hong. "They just have a feeling and
like having that bar" 'ah, it's kinda like here.'"
They position the cursor where it feels right, and click.
<br><br>
There have been complaints that <a href="http://hotornot.com">Hot or Not</a> 
is silly, superficial, and sexist. 
No one
thinks it's hard to understand. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;
(Quoted from Poundstone book, chapter 14.)
</blockquote>
The rest was history &ndash; Hot or Not became 
one of the most successful web sites ever.
If you try it, it should quickly become apparent to you that <i>ranking</i> the hotties
in order, is a lot harder than (and will take you longer than) <i>rating</i> them.
(You have to make sure no two have the same ranking, 
and make tough hotness-comparison judgements,
and that takes time.)  So again: it takes <i>less time</i> to rate people than to
do other things which provide less information!
</p>
<p>
The "many choices paradox"
range voting critics are actually <i>correct</i> that there is a "paradox";
it is just that it is a different paradox than they thought, and it yields
exactly the opposite conclusion than they thought.
</p>

<h3> Here is a more sarcastic  response: </h3>

<p>
"Oh my god, I can't breathe! I'm going to die!"
</p>

<p>
&ndash; "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the vast number of air molecules in the room! There are over 10<sup>25</sup> of
them!  I can't choose which!"
</p>

<p>
&ndash; "OK! Hang on! I'm going to transfer you to a vacuum chamber where there are only 10
air molecules!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you!"
</p>
