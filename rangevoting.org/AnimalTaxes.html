<H1> More clues on how to optimize society from animal behavior(?) </h1>
<h2> Animal taxes </H2>

<p>
It seems many animal societies (clans, tribes, troupes, call them what you
will)
involve "taxes" where food is acquired by some members and
then redistributed to others, including highly genetically unrelated others,
in the animal society. This helps that society. There is also "tax evasion"
and "policing" of "tax cheats."
</p><p>
One might argue the taxation level must be near-optimum since
if society A had less-optimal tax level than competing society B, then
it'd be outcompeted and the animal-type-B clans would have taken over the
species.
</p><p>
A deeper look (I thank biologist 
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sloan-wilson/#blogger_bio#blogger_bio">David Sloan Wilson</a>
for this point)
indicates that animal tax levels always <i>under</I>estimate the truly-optimum-for-society
levels because there is <i>both</i> group-based and
individual-based Darwinian selection going on.
</p><p>
The more "tightly-knit" groups are &ndash; that is, more precisely, the
rarer it is for matings and/or migrations to occur across group boundaries &ndash;
the closer that animal species's taxes will be to societally-optimum levels, but
they will always be underestimates.
</p><p>
The optimum level also depends on the kind of lifestyle that animal has.
Some animals such as "naked mole rats" have lifestyles in which cooperation
is extremely helpful, probably essential, for the survival of a colony.   Other kinds 
of animals lead largely-solitary lives and taxation for them would be virtually irrelevant.
</p><p>
Anyhow, it looks like "optimum" taxation levels can be quite high;
one estimate of a 60% tax rate is mentioned. 
However, really, to make a fairer
comparison/translation to human societies, you might want to include "child care
expenses" as part of "taxes" (?) in which case contemporary
human tax levels might also be
around 60%.
</p><p>
Anyhow, here is the article "Taxing, a Ritual to Save the Species,"
by NATALIE ANGIER <i>New York Times Science Section</I> 14 April 2009:

On these taxing days, when we become a defiantly bipartisan nation of whiners
convinced that we are handing over to the Internal Revenue Service our blood and
sweat and mother's milk, our pound of flesh and firstborn young, maybe it's time
for a little perspective.
</p><p>
Legions before us have donated all these items and more to the public till, and
not just metaphorically speaking, either. Benjamin Franklin was right to equate
paying taxes with a deeply organic behavior like dying. It turns out that giving
up a portion of one's income for the sake of the tribe is such a ubiquitous
feature of the human race that some researchers see it as crucial to our
species' success. Without ritualized taxation, there would be precious little
hominid representation.
</p><p>
Moreover, plenty of nonhuman animals practice the tither's art, too, demanding
that individuals remit a portion of their food, labor, comfort or personal
fecundity for the privilege of group membership. And just as the I.R.S. depends
on threat of audit as much as it does on anybody's sense of civic
responsibility, so do other toll-collecting species ensure compliance by meting
out swift punishment against tax cheats. For example, Marc Hauser of Harvard
University has found that when a rhesus monkey is out foraging and comes upon a
source of especially high-quality food, like, say, a batch of ripe coconuts, the
monkey is expected to give a characteristic food call to alert its comrades to
the find. "The bad thing about doing a food call is that it means others will
come and take some of the food," said Laurie R. Santos, who studies the primates
at Yale University. Yet a monkey who opts to keep mum about its discovery could
face worse. Should other group members happen by while the private feast is
under way, they will not only claim the food for themselves, but the most
dominant among them will also beat the cheater indignantly.
</p><p>
Not everybody is subject to a big macaque attack. Adolescent males that have
only recently transferred into the group are not required to issue food alerts.
They are, as yet, on probation, and only upon gaining the rights of full
citizenship will the young males be expected to shoulder its duties.
</p><p>
The more closely knit an animal society is, and the more interdependent its
members, the higher the rate of taxation.
[EDITOR'S NOTE: see preface for what that means exactly.]
Among bell miner birds of Australia, for example, pairs of breeding adults are
assisted at the nest by several youthful helpers, usually male. The helpers
provision the couple's fledglings with a steady supply of "lerp," sugary casings
secreted by plant-sucking insects. And though some scientists had wondered
whether lerp wasn't basically a junk food, offered up to the young bell miners
as much for show as for substance, researchers report in the March issue of
Animal Behaviour that lerp is, in fact, as important to the fledglings' growth
as is the meatier arthropod prey supplied by their parents. By all evidence, the
helper birds are honestly "paying to stay," trading a valuable currency for the
right to remain within the aggressively guarded precincts of a bell miner
breeding colony, with the hope of better times and personal propagation
opportunities ahead.
</p><p>
Or at least of averting personal injury. Among another Australian species of
cooperatively breeding birds, the superb fairy-wren, dominant males notice when
their helpers are less than superb about paying their taxes. Should a helper
fail to feed and groom the dominant's nestlings, or to give an alarm call on
seeing intruders enter the territory, the dominant male will angrily chase,
harass and peck at the helper, for up to 26 hours at a time. In the case of the
highly social cichlid fish, fear of punishment inspires delinquent helper fish
to ostentatiously redouble their contributions to the communal nest, their
digging in the sand, their cleaning and fanning of the eggs &ndash;  rather like
politicians who suddenly pony up three years of back taxes for themselves, the
nanny and the gardener. "If they don't pay their bill, there will be
punishment," said Michael Taborsky of the University of Bern, "so they try to
pre-emptively appease the dominant individuals in the group."
</p><p>
If hope and fear don't guarantee compliance, there's always embarrassment.
Vampire bats are famous for their willingness to regurgitate a blood meal to
feed fellow bats that are down on their luck. In fact, hiding one's wealth is a
problem. A fully fed vampire bat is as bloated as a fraternity water balloon,
and the bats appear to rub bellies to see who is in a position to share. "It's
hard to cheat when your stomach is obviously distended," Dr. Santos said.
</p><p>
It's also hard to cheat when you live in a small band of big-brained, sharp-eyed
individuals, as humans did for vast stretches of our past, which may help
explain why we are so easily taxed. "There's not a human society in the world
that doesn't redistribute food to nonrelatives," said Samuel Bowles, director of
the behavioral sciences program at the Santa Fe Institute. "Whether it's through
the state, or the chief, or a rural collective, or some other mechanism, food
sharing of large nutritional packages is quite extensive and has been going on
for at least 100,000 years of human history." In hunting and foraging cultures,
the proportional tax rate is so high, said Dr. Bowles, that "even the Swedes
would be impressed."
</p><p>
Take the case of the Ache tribe of Paraguay. Hunters bring their bounty back to
a common pot. 
"The majority of calories are redistributed," he said. "It ends up
being something like a 60 percent income tax."
</p><p>
Pastoral and herding societies tend to be less egalitarian than foraging
cultures, and yet, here, too, taxing is often used to help rectify extreme
inequities. When a rich cattle farmer dies among the Tandroy of southern
Madagascar, Dr. Bowles said, "The rich person's stock is killed and eaten by
everyone," often down to the last head of cattle. "That's a 100 percent
inheritance tax."
</p><p>
Modern taxes are just a "newfangled version of commitment to the group," said
David Sloan Wilson of Binghamton University, the result of the invention of
money. Yet even with our elaborate, abstracted tax code, fear of public
opprobrium remains an impressive motivator. "It's expected that powerful,
high-status members of society should be contributing more," Dr. Wilson said.
"If they don't, they won't remain high status for long." And for the fat bats
among us who just won't cough up the goods  &ndash;  there's always jail.
