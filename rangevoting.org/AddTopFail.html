<H3> Typical simple example  of "add-top failure" </H3>

<p>
"<a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV<a>" 
is a  voting method intended to try to
combine the virtues of Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) with 
Condorcet: BTR-IRV will always elect a Condorcet-winner if one exists.
The BTR-IRV method is this.  Each "vote" is a rank-ordering of the N candidates.
The two candidates with the fewest top-rank votes ("the two worst")
are compared head-to-head based
on all the votes with the remaining N-2 candidates erased from the picture.
Whoever loses this comparison ("the worst")
is eliminated from the election and from all votes.
We then continue doing such eliminations
until only one candidate remains, and declare him winner.
</p>

<p> 
There are many many voting methods out there, and (like this one) all sound like
reasonably good ideas, at least at first.   We are just considering BTR-IRV here as
a typical example.  Because BTR-IRV is a Condorcet method, a 
<i>general-purpose theorem</I> tells
us it must exhibit "add-top failure."  Our goal on  this page is to make
that completely concrete by actually exhibiting a BTR-IRV election in which that
happens.  Here it is:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="4" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>
3 
</td>
<td>
A > D > B > C 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3
<td>
A > D > C > B
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
<td>
B > C > A > D 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5
<td>
D > B > C > A 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
<td>
C > A > B > D 
</td>
</tr>
</table

<p>
In this 19-voter example,
<b>A wins</b> (C, B, and D are eliminated in that order).
But if we add 6 new voters each of whom votes
A>C>B>D, i.e. all ranking the current winner A top...
then C wins!  One of the new votes 
ranking the current-winner top actually causes him to lose!
(End of example.)
</p>

<p>
The proof of the "general-purpose theorem"  is not at all mysterious.  It simply exhibits 
about 7 different fully-concrete 
election scenarios just like the table above (in fact this is one of them)
and argues via a case analysis
that no matter what election method you use, if it is a "Condorcet method,"
then it must exhibit add-top failure (that is: adding some new votes all ranking the
current winner top, causes him to <i>lose</i>)
in at least one of those 7 scenarios.

<H3> Another example </H3>

<p>
Here is another example of add-top failure, this time for "Rouse's voting method,"
another (fairly complicated to describe) elimination method that elects
Condorcet winners whenever they exist.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="4" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td>
5
</td>
<td>
C > A > B
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4
<td>
A > B > C
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2
<td>
B > C > A
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this 11-voter example,
<b>A wins</b> (C then B are eliminated).
But if we add 2 new voters each of whom votes
A>C>B, i.e. all ranking the current winner A top...
then C wins! (B then A are eliminated.)  One of the new votes 
ranking the current-winner top actually causes him to lose!
