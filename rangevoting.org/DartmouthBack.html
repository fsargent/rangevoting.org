Backsliding at Dartmouth College? 
</H2>

<p>
Dartmouth adopted <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting in 1990
to fill vacancies as they arose on its 
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~trustees">Board of Trustees</a>.
<small>[Dartmouth has 18 trustees. The procedure during 1990-2007 was
for them to be elected in single-winner
elections when a vacancy needs to be filled,
from 3 nominees selected by Council, plus however many more satisfy
petition requirements.  Apparently over 20000 voters typically participated.]</small>
But as of 2007 , it appears from <a href="assets/documents/DartmouthRept083007.pdf">this report (pdf)</a>
that Dartmouth is about to abandon it to go back to plurality voting.
Why?
</p>
<p>
Well, frankly, the reasons given in the report make no sense to us, and some of the claims there
are false:
</p>
<ul><li>
Page 27: "Some colleges ... have incorporated instant runoff...
to prevent the election of candidates with less than a majority of the
vote."  
<br>
But this is false &ndash; instant runoff <a href="CoreSupp.html">can</a>
elect a candidate M
despite the fact that large supermajorities of voters prefer C over both M and 
every other rival.  (As happened in <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a>.)
</li><li>
Page 6: They complain that "The elections have begun to resemble
modern &ndash; and expensive &ndash; political campaigns, something 'unheard of in 
alumni elections' as the <i>Boston Globe</i>
put it <small>[Marcela Bombardieri: College trustees clash on key values &ndash; Dartmouth alumni
funding both sides, 3 April 2007]</small>... mass mailings... advertisements... [one spent]
$75000
on his campaign and he is not alone..."
<br>
But approval voting has nothing to do with this, indeed there 
is <a href="RL2parties.html#cash">reason to believe</a>
that Approval <i>decreases</i> the importance of cash.
</li><li>
Approval is "confusing."
<br>
But it actually is <i>simpler</i> than plurality voting (gets rid of the "overvotes are illegal"
rule) and in all experiments
with real human voters I am aware of, AV resulted in <i>decreased</i> ballot 
<a href="SPRates.html">spoilage</a> rates.
</li><li>
Page 9. "Some alumni have noted that [approval voting] permits a form of tactical
voting known as 'bullet voting'... write-ins."  

under which organized supporters of a
particular candidate are encouraged to vote only for that candidate
and no other."
<br>
Huh? So to eliminate the "threat" of "bullet voting," force <i>everyone</i> to
bullet vote and discard their ballots if they do otherwise?!?!
</li><li>
The facts: 
<ol type="a">
<li> <a href="BulletBugaboo.html">Bullet voting</a>
can be not "strategic," but rather a "big mistake";
</li><li>
with approval voting, it <i>always</i> is strategically optimal
to vote your true favorite top,
and in 3-candidate races it <i>always</i> is strategically optimal to cast a vote 
consistent with your true preference order; 
</li><li>
meanwhile with <a href="Plurality.html">plurality voting</a>,
voting for your true favorite
can easily be a strategic mistake.   
</li><li>
(From Dartmouth math professor Robert Z. Norman)
In 2007 there was a per voter average of  voting for 1.81 candidates.
Hence the proportion of bullet votes had to be fairly small (or else
nearly everyone voted for
one or all three candidates, but not two, which would seem crazy).
<blockquote><small>
Specifically, if all ballots approved either 1 or 2 candidates, there must have been 
19% approve-1
and 81% approve-2 ballots.
Norman in later email later hypothesized that actually there may have been a strategy of
"either voting for the petition candidate or voting for all [3 opposing] nominated candidates."
If that was the only thing going on then
60% of the votes would have been approve-1 and the remaining 40.5% approve-3s,
but in this case approval voting was clearly showing its immense value by
preventing an enormous "vote-split" among the 3.   
In any case the fraction of "approve&ge;2" ballots presumably had to be somewhere
between 40.5% and 81%.
<!--
RZ Norman: speculates perhaps nearly all DID vote for 1 or all 3!?!?
"Unlikely as that might be, it would suggest
that most of those who voted followed a strategy of either voting for the
petition candidate or voting for all nominated candidates, in which case
Richie's claim that the opposition was disorganized falls apart, as does the
claim by some of the Alumni Council people that in a 1 on 1 situation the
petition candidate would been defeated." 
-->
</small></blockquote>
</li></ul>
<p>
Nevertheless, apparently all that made sense to the brilliant individuals making
voting recommendations for Dartmouth.   We suspect that the Dartmouth
voters would be less likely to countenance
e.g, abandoning choosing valedictorians via grade-point averages
and switching to "each professor names one student" plurality voting.  
(Well, we <i>know</i> they would be less likely, since count the number of years this
system has been operating without any such proposal.)  In other words, 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
would seem less likely to lead to a backslide.

<h3> Dartmouth Undergraduate Student Government </h3>

<p>
Although the <i>Trustees</i> stopped using Approval Voting
as described above, the <i>Students</i> (who'd previously  
used <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>)
switched <i>to</i> approval voting to elect the student body 
president (and also vice president)
starting with the 2011 election.
</p><a name="yoeli"></a><p>
Here's what happened in their 
<b>2011 presidential election.</b>
(We thank Harry J. Enten'11, who did the counting, for this data.)
First of all, the election was quite strange because 
only one candidate, Max D. Yoeli'12, was "on ballot"
with two other major candidates, 
William R. Hix'12
and
Aaron R. Limonthas'12,
both running as 
"write-ins."
Hix was ineligible to run on-ballot under EPAC rules due to a previous
suspension; Limonthas ran from <i>home</i> in Texas, since he was not
living at Dartmouth (an "off term") at the time.
To add to the strangeness, the student newspaper reported some wrong numbers,
overstating Hix's and Limonthas's approvals  (although 
it got the winners correct).

<a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2011/04/18/news/assembly">The Dartmouth</a> 
18 April 2011 (article by Tina Ma) says
"A total of 1,665 ballots were cast in the presidential race, which represents the 
lowest voter turnout in the past three years, according to EPAC chair Harry Enten '11."
</p><p>
1564 ballots approved at least one among the "big three." 
Restricted to the top 3 candidates only,
the ballots were as follows:
<!-- 613+533+300+41+40+29+8 = 1564 -->

<b>Yoeli</b> probably would have been the <b>plain-plurality</b> voting winner too, but it is 
mathematically possible that it would have been <b>Hix</b>, e.g. 
if enough of the 41+8=49 Hix-and-Yoeli both-approving
voters plus enough of the 40 Hix-and-Limonthas approvers would have voted Hix
if forced to choose only one (and if not too many of
the 29 Yoeli-and-Limonthas approvers would have chosen Yoeli).
The 71 voters who approved <i>no</i> big-3 candidate, and the 8 who approved all three
&ndash; 79 (4.7%)
in all &ndash;
were unable to influence the race among them.  However
even if they'd all voted for Hix, that would not have been quite enough to make him win, so
they could not have changed the winner.
</p><p>
If <b>Instant Runoff</b> or any other full-ranking-as-ballots system
had been used, this election would have been a disaster in the sense that each voter
would have had to provide a full rank-ordering of 119 candidates (if all the write-ins had
been included) &ndash; or actually that would have been impossible, in which case a restriction to
only the on-ballot candidates would have meant the "election" had only one candidate,
which would have been an even worse joke.
<a href="IRV3.html">Top-3-only bastardized IRV</a> would have been feasible, but would have 
placed write-ins at an artificially-severe disadvantage (well actually, they already were 
disadvantaged, but IRV3 would have made it more severe by causing vote-splitting effects among the
write-ins, which they did not suffer with approval voting).
IRV3 probably would have elected Yoeli, although again, there is a slim chance it
wouldn't.
</p><p>
(<a href="BulletBugaboo.html#Dartmouth">Information</a>
about the 2006 student president election conducted via IRV, and about the next two
approval <a href="RichieOnApproval.html">elections</a>.)
</p><p>
For <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
we have recommended that the candidate with
the <b>greatest average</b> win.
If we regard the <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> system used here as {0,1} 
range voting (i.e. with only 0 and 1 as permitted scores)
and <i>if</i> candidates left unmentioned by voters were regarded as literally, "no opinion"
votes, then plain-averaging would have got into trouble by electing some unknown write-in.
It is for that reason that average-based range voting with "no-opinion" scores permitted,
is recommended for use with a <a href="BetterQuorum.html">quorum</a> rule
(and if write-in candidacies are permitted, this seems <i>essential</i>).
In the present case, if we had used the "soft quorum" method of 
giving every candidate 60 "artificial 0 pseudoscores" before voting started,
then Yoeli still would have won with all the low-approval write-in candidates left in the dust??
</p><p>
More will be added later??  #approved histogram? #total ballots? 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/SPRates.htl">spoilage</a> rates? Election admin problems?
More previous Dartmouth elections?  
What did Yoeli, Hix, and Limonthas think of the election method?
