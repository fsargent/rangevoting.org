<br><br><b><a href="http://www.sp-usa.org/">Brown, Walter F.</a></b>  (12345)
Oswego OR USA;<br>Walter F. Brown ran for president under the
<a href="http://sp-usa.org/">Socialist</a>,
Protecting Working Families,
<a href="http://www.natural-law.org/">Natural Law</a>, and
United Citizens party banners in
2004, getting about 11,000 votes. (Only on the ballot in 8 states.) With
Range Voting it is safe to say he would have got at least 50 times more votes
(as a ratio to Bush's votes, say) and quite plausibly 500 times more.  Brown
is a lawyer, served as state Senator in Oregon (as a Democrat; three terms
1974-1986) and was a Socialist Party candidate for U.S. Congress in 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2004.  Probably his greatest victory in the Senate came in
1975: the world's first ban on ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); a
ban which served as a  model for several other governments (there is now a
worldwide ban  by treaty, basically).  Brown has agreed to endorse us,
although the precise final wording may not appear for some
time. (Correspondence with him is slow since he is  not an e-mail-type
person.) He also regards it as likely that we can get the party-wide
endorsement from the SP-USA within a couple of months and is helping with
getting that done.  This may not be the final form of Brown's endorsement. <br>

<br><br><b><font color="#0000ff">Unger, Stephen H.</font></b> &lt;unger@cs.columbia.ed&gt;  (2456) New York NY USA;<br>I agree that range voting (RV) is probably the best voting system overall. With respect to political elections, my present view is that the special case of approval voting (AV) would be preferable to multi-range RV because it is easier for voters to understand and easier to do the vote counting. It would probably be easier to get it accepted. Furthermore, I can't think of a situation--and I might be missing something here--where I would want to give a political candidate something other than an extreme score. I believe I am thinking here in terms of strategic voting, which is what I do in political elections. In many other cases, such as a committee voting on who should get a prize, or on who should be admitted to some program, I believe the multi-range RV would be better. There are also cases where a group is trying to make some decision and all are sincerely trying to make the choice that is most satisfying to the most people. In such a situation strategic voting is not appropriate and multi-range RV clearly is the best choice. (An example would be an extended family voting on where to go for its annual weekend gathering.) <br> I am a computer science (and EE) professor who has done research and development work, mostly in hardware, but a fair amount in software work as well. I am the author of <i>Asynchronous Sequential Switching Circuits</I>, The Essence of Logic Circuits. <br> With respect to organizational and technology-society issues my experience includes: membership IEEE Board of Directors, President IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology (I was one of the principal founders), member AAAS Committee on Scientific Freedom and  Responsibility, extensive writing and talks on subjects such as governmental secrecy, energy policy, war, engineering employment, and, most recently, electronic voting.  I also am the author of <i>Controlling Technology: Ethics and the Responsible Engineer</i>. <br>

I am urging others to join me during the post-primary elections to call print, radio, and TV media to ask them why they are not publicizing that it is a waste of taxpayers' money to have runoff elections, that there's a better way ... that eliminating runoffs reduces incumbents' campaign-funding advantage over challengers who may spend their whole budget just to get to the runoff, and lastly IRV allows voters to vote for their real choice without the fear of making a "spoiler"!

<br><br><b><a href="http://...">Bristow-Johnson, Robert</a></b> &lt;rbj@audioimagination,com&gt;  (456) Burlington VT USA;<br> |Condorcet is better than Range (Score) Voting or Approval Voting.  Range requires too much information from the voter and Approval requires too little (is not expressive enough).  Despite claims made by Range and Approval advocates, both methods present the voter with an immediate strategy questions when voting, especially if the voter particularly likes one candidate and merely approves of some others.  They have to guess at what particular values to score these candidates in Range (may as well get the dart board out, or bring dice to the voting booth) and whether or not to "approve" of the non-favorite, but acceptable candidates in Approval.  They will likely just rank their favorite 99 (or mark "approve") and everyone else 0 (or "not approved"), so as not to compete with their favorite.  Then it devolves into First-Past-The-Post which is no reform at all. | |Of the Condorcet methods, Schulze is probably the fairest Condorcet method, but Ranked Pairs is simpler and in the very rare cases that there is a cycle, Schulze and Ranked Pairs elect the same candidate if the Smith set is 3 candidates (and I believe it would be far more unlikely that the Smith set would be larger than 3 even if the unlikely case of a cycle).  So governments should adopt Tideman Ranked Pairs for all single-winner races, and maybe (not sure about it) proportional STV for multi-winner races. |<br>

<br><br><b><font color="#0000ff">Langer, David P.</font></b>  (123456) Buffalo Grove IL USA;<br>Dr. Warren Smith and the people at CRV have presented, using historical, empirical, and mathematical evidence, a strong and well-reasoned argument for their simple common-sense democratic reforms.  The unchecked growth of government, its increasing unresponsiveness to the popular will, and the unbreakable grip on power by our two-party duopoly are all serious, entrenched problems that resist resolution largely due to the effective decline of the level of democracy in our nation.  More democracy is better; that's an absolute.  Proposals like range voting, unbiased automatic redistricting, mandatory recorded roll-call votes on all legislation, the identification of the authors of every component of proposed legislation, and easier ballot access can not only go a long way toward resolving these stubborn issues, but will also increase people's interest, participation, and trust in our cherished democracy.  Changes like those proposed here, as well as others like term limits for all federal elective offices and federal judgeships and supermajority requirements for tax increases, are long overdue. | |David Langer |Mathematics Department |Triton College |River Grove, IL<br>

Multi-representative districts (e.g. Arkansas electing its four representatives in one election) following a proportional representation system (D'Hont comes to my mind), would also be conducive to less gerrymandering and better representation of people views in Congress.<br>

Occasionally, a voter comes up to me with an over-voted ballot asking why they can't pick more than one person for a race.

I kind of like mixed-member proportional representation more, but range/approval voting is very good too and it fits into the current American system better.<br>

In Maine the Green Party is widely recognized with over 24,155

I am very concerned about freedom and democracy, and have looked carefully at various voting reform systems as a non-partisan way to improve this.  I have lived in Europe for 9 years and have seen how system of elections affects the process and the results. | |I have concluded that Range Voting would be the optimal reform.  This method would reduce the incentive for negative campaigning.  It favors a psychological shift from comparing candidates to evaluating each candidate on his or her merit. | |My preference is Approval Voting (range = 0..1).  It is the optimal strategy for Range Voting.  If even a few people use that strategy, it is best that everyone do so to preserve an equal voice for all.  The purpose of an election is to elect a candidate.  Detailed preferences, I believe, are better expressed in polls. <br>

Yes, as a Libertarian I pray that we may elect more candidates, but far more important is that a better voting system be implemented.

<br><br><b><a href="http://...">Gibbs, Joshua L.</a></b> &lt;LowellGbbs@aol.com&gt;  (123456) Weirsdale FL USA;<br>I have an IQ high enough that when I was in elementary school I would have placed in the "gifted" class, except that my social skills were too low. I am good friends with most of my local church's staff (including our popular, politically active, and locally reputable pastor) and could probably get them to endorse your ballot initiative because it is a nonpartisan reform. My perspective is deferred to by my friends and most of my family when they are not sure what the scripturally correct belief or action is. I know many people dissatisfied with our nation's government and many people who are getting tired of the culture wars. I live in an area with many senior citizens, who are statistically much more likely to vote, though slightly less likely to major support changes to the current system even when to their advantage. I am unmarried and have only a part time job, so that I am capable of slightly more activism through the internet, mail, or phone than the average person even though I have insomnia and can not go door to door due to not yet attaining a driver's license. I am very passionate when it comes to issues of freedom and equality. I know many people who believe the constitution should be restored to it's proper role in government. I am some friendly relationships with differing factions and so could spread these ideas beyond my own clique. I love you, and I do so as a representative of Jesus Christ. I look forward to serving you.<br>
