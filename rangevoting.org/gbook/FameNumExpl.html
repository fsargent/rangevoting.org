<H2> How to compute your Fame Number </H2>

<p>
The reason we want your endorsement is to impress people.
Your job is to estimate how impressive you think people will find your
endorsement.
</p>

<p>
The rule is: if your impressiveness is one in 10<sup>n</sup>
then your fame-number is n.  The allowed values of n are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
Now be honest about it!
</p>

<H3> Examples: </H3>

<p>
If you think your impressiveness for this purpose is huge - one in a billion - put 9.
(Albert Einstein.  Mahatma Gandhi.   Current US President.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in 100 million, put 8.
(Nobel prize winner.  US Party leader.  World chess champion.  Nationwide leader of a trade union.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in ten million, put 7.
(US Senator or Governor.    Top US religious leader.
CEO of fortune-500 corporation.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in a million, put 6.
(US Congressperson.  A party leader in some US State.  Member of National Academy of Sciences.
Own an election-related business.  Author of books on voting methods.  Generals.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in a one hundred thousand, put 5.
(US County executive.  House member in some US state.  Typical political science professor
or pretty distinguished professor in some other area.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in ten thousand, put 4.
(Typical professor.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in one thousand, put 3.
(Typical Ministers,  Teachers,  PhDs,  Lawyers,  Election observers &amp; workers.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in one hundred, put 2.
(Veterans.  Member of League of Women Voters.)
</p>

<p>
If your impressiveness is one in ten, put 1.
(Manager.)
</p>

<p>
If you are just an average person, put 0.
</p>

<H3> Apology </H3>

<p>
We hope this exercise does not offend you.
The alternative is that <i>we</i> decide how impressive &amp; famous you are for you.
We decided that would be rather more likely to hurt people's feelings than
having them rank themselves.
