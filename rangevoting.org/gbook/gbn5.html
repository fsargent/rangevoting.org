<br><br><b><font color="#0000ff">Unger, Stephen H.</font></b> &lt;unger@cs.columbia.ed&gt;  (2456) New York NY USA;<br>I agree that range voting (RV) is probably the best voting system overall. With respect to political elections, my present view is that the special case of approval voting (AV) would be preferable to multi-range RV because it is easier for voters to understand and easier to do the vote counting. It would probably be easier to get it accepted. Furthermore, I can't think of a situation--and I might be missing something here--where I would want to give a political candidate something other than an extreme score. I believe I am thinking here in terms of strategic voting, which is what I do in political elections. In many other cases, such as a committee voting on who should get a prize, or on who should be admitted to some program, I believe the multi-range RV would be better. There are also cases where a group is trying to make some decision and all are sincerely trying to make the choice that is most satisfying to the most people. In such a situation strategic voting is not appropriate and multi-range RV clearly is the best choice. (An example would be an extended family voting on where to go for its annual weekend gathering.) <br> I am a computer science (and EE) professor who has done research and development work, mostly in hardware, but a fair amount in software work as well. I am the author of <i>Asynchronous Sequential Switching Circuits</I>, The Essence of Logic Circuits. <br> With respect to organizational and technology-society issues my experience includes: membership IEEE Board of Directors, President IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology (I was one of the principal founders), member AAAS Committee on Scientific Freedom and  Responsibility, extensive writing and talks on subjects such as governmental secrecy, energy policy, war, engineering employment, and, most recently, electronic voting.  I also am the author of <i>Controlling Technology: Ethics and the Responsible Engineer</i>. <br>
