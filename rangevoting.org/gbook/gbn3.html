<br><br><b><font color="#0000ff">Langer, David P.</font></b>  (123456) Buffalo Grove IL USA;<br>Dr. Warren Smith and the people at CRV have presented, using historical, empirical, and mathematical evidence, a strong and well-reasoned argument for their simple common-sense democratic reforms.  The unchecked growth of government, its increasing unresponsiveness to the popular will, and the unbreakable grip on power by our two-party duopoly are all serious, entrenched problems that resist resolution largely due to the effective decline of the level of democracy in our nation.  More democracy is better; that's an absolute.  Proposals like range voting, unbiased automatic redistricting, mandatory recorded roll-call votes on all legislation, the identification of the authors of every component of proposed legislation, and easier ballot access can not only go a long way toward resolving these stubborn issues, but will also increase people's interest, participation, and trust in our cherished democracy.  Changes like those proposed here, as well as others like term limits for all federal elective offices and federal judgeships and supermajority requirements for tax increases, are long overdue. | |David Langer |Mathematics Department |Triton College |River Grove, IL<br>

Multi-representative districts (e.g. Arkansas electing its four representatives in one election) following a proportional representation system (D'Hont comes to my mind), would also be conducive to less gerrymandering and better representation of people views in Congress.<br>

Occasionally, a voter comes up to me with an over-voted ballot asking why they can't pick more than one person for a race. And every time I think to myself how approval voting would slot in so easily in place of the archaic FPTP! I kind of like mixed-member proportional representation more, but range/approval voting is very good too and it fits into the current American system better.<br>
