Greetings! I do agree with the Range Voting Method
personally.I am an Officer  on the Maine Green Independent Party's Steering ( state Executive )
Committee. I am a Member as well as the Scribe. I am also the Municipal Chairperson for the MGIP in
Stetson, Maine, as well as
an Alternate Delegate to the National Committee Convention. I have some more
reading to do, but I 
do certainly agree with what I have read so far, third parties are never
thought of...Well rarely if they are. 
In Maine the Green Party is widely recognized with over 24,155
registered Greeens. I will approach Pat LaMarche as well as Morgen D'Arc they are both our USGP
Reps. And see how they and the 
entire committee feels about the Range Voting. However, I do personally
encourage continued Activism and Lobbying on the Range Voting.... | |
Peace, | |Lester M. Timofeev<br>

Also recommend <a href="http://www.electiondefensealliance.org/">election defense alliance</a>. I am happy to support range voting.  First we must have actual voting and vote counting so we can purge the administration of the criminal cabal (R's & D's alike). Then we can start to go about resurrecting our democracy. "Just like global warming and climate crisis, the debate about whether electronic voting machines are secure or not is long over.  There is overwhelming consensus among computer scientists and security experts that electronic voting machines are fundamentally and unacceptably vulnerable. And like the climate crisis, the only discussion remaining is what we do about it." --Megan Matson, Election Reform Activist. | |<br>

<br><br><b><a href="http://www.mit.edu/~amu">Ucko, Aaron M.</a></b> &lt;amu@alum.mit.edu&gt;  (12345) Washington DC USA;<br>I have a decently wide range of experience with "alternative" voting systems (mainly IRV/STV and Condorcet-SSD), and feel that pretty much anything would be an improvement over crude plurality.  Although I'm not convinced that Condorcet's inevitable mathematical flaws are all that likely to be a problem in practice, I concede that range voting has the considerable advantage of being far simpler to understand, so I shall willingly endorse it.  I also support your remaining proposals, and moreover call for voter-verifiable paper trails in all elections (per http://www.verifiedvoting.org/).<br>

I have met with a number of candidates for different political parties and have worked on diverse campaigns.  My hobby is pretty exclusively studying economics and political science, with occasional forays into other fields.  I have developed something of a fledgling political network and intend to advance it consistently.  My goal is to go into politics as a career - preferably however, as a policy analyst and/or lobbyist rather than as a politician myself.  I am a Libertarian in orientation (though I will work with anyone who can advance my ideological goals).<br>
