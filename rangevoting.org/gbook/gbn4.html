That feature may, of course, prevent it from being adopted by the powers-that-be, who already have plenty of opinion polls and appropriately compatible rhetoric which they routinely disregard. | |On the other hand, people show a heartening resilience for voting in polls which take their opinions seriously.  An unofficial range poll held parallel to an official traditional poll could affirm that the emperors wear no clothes.<br>

<br><br><b><a href="http://BlackPlanet.com/Namorado_TX">Apurim, Alán Alán </a></b> &lt;apurim@gmail.com&gt;  (123456) Houston TX USA;<br>Known among Houston's immigrant Igbos as "the doctor," I've been promoting RV for years, but I am late in endorsing it on-site.  I promote it most strongly to fellow members of Harris County Green Party in Texas, although this URL's also in my regular e-mail's outgoing signature text for most correspondence.  I am urging others to join me during the post-primary elections to call print, radio, and TV media to ask them why they are not publicizing that it is a waste of taxpayers' money to have runoff elections, that there's a better way ... that eliminating runoffs reduces incumbents' campaign-funding advantage over challengers who may spend their whole budget just to get to the runoff, and lastly IRV allows voters to vote for their real choice without the fear of making a "spoiler"!  Use the viral method: "each one teach one," until everybody knows, and all will want this system, legislating it into existence.<br>

I'm a huge fan of the work of RangeVoting.org! Our current electoral systems are in desperate need of reform. See Dorthy Fadiman's powerful documentary "Stealing America Vote by Vote" about the travesty of the 2004 election. Voting is at the core of a democratic government which truly reflects the will of the people. Not using the best performing methods and technologies for voting and districting makes a mockery of our ideals. <br>

<br><br><b><a href="http://...">Bristow-Johnson, Robert</a></b> &lt;rbj@audioimagination,com&gt;  (456) Burlington VT USA;<br> |Condorcet is better than Range (Score) Voting or Approval Voting.  Range requires too much information from the voter and Approval requires too little (is not expressive enough).  Despite claims made by Range and Approval advocates, both methods present the voter with an immediate strategy questions when voting, especially if the voter particularly likes one candidate and merely approves of some others.  They have to guess at what particular values to score these candidates in Range (may as well get the dart board out, or bring dice to the voting booth) and whether or not to "approve" of the non-favorite, but acceptable candidates in Approval.  They will likely just rank their favorite 99 (or mark "approve") and everyone else 0 (or "not approved"), so as not to compete with their favorite.  Then it devolves into First-Past-The-Post which is no reform at all. | |Of the Condorcet methods, Schulze is probably the fairest Condorcet method, but Ranked Pairs is simpler and in the very rare cases that there is a cycle, Schulze and Ranked Pairs elect the same candidate if the Smith set is 3 candidates (and I believe it would be far more unlikely that the Smith set would be larger than 3 even if the unlikely case of a cycle).  So governments should adopt Tideman Ranked Pairs for all single-winner races, and maybe (not sure about it) proportional STV for multi-winner races. |<br>
