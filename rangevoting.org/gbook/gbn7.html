Oswego OR USA;<br>Walter F. Brown ran for president under the 
<a href="http://sp-usa.org/">Socialist</a>,
Protecting Working Families, 
<a href="http://www.natural-law.org/">Natural Law</a>, and 
United Citizens party banners in
2004, getting about 11,000 votes. (Only on the ballot in 8 states.) With
Range Voting it is safe to say he would have got at least 50 times more votes
(as a ratio to Bush's votes, say) and quite plausibly 500 times more.  Brown
is a lawyer, served as state Senator in Oregon (as a Democrat; three terms
1974-1986) and was a Socialist Party candidate for U.S. Congress in 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2004.  Probably his greatest victory in the Senate came in
1975: the world's first ban on ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); a
ban which served as a  model for several other governments (there is now a
worldwide ban  by treaty, basically).  Brown has agreed to endorse us,
although the precise final wording may not appear for some
time. (Correspondence with him is slow since he is  not an e-mail-type
person.) He also regards it as likely that we can get the party-wide
endorsement from the SP-USA within a couple of months and is helping with
getting that done.  This may not be the final form of Brown's endorsement. <br>
