<H1> Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Red Crayon </H1>
<p><small>By <a href="

<p>
My first post on the subject implied that former interim elections official 
Patrick O'Connor was lying about the 2009 ranked-choice-voting-powered election in 
Minneapolis, as the official
<a href="MinnepolisRCVreptJune2010.pdf">report</a>
(which he commissioned) contradicts his claims. 
But today I found, 
the exact same lie is being propagated by the author of the report!
</p><p>
I started to question my own sanity here. These guys really should know better, 
and no one could really expect to get away with such an obvious lie. 
Is it possible I'm the one whose wrong? But then I remembered 
how absolutely ludicrous it is to suggest that only one ballot out of nearly 50,000 
could be spoiled. 
No system has ever been that accurate, and anything under 1% is considered a triumph of 
electoral vigilance.
</p><p>
But then I noticed the subtlety they're using here. Both O'Connor and Schulze 
talk about spoiled ballots earlier in their articles, but when they try to counter the 
complaints of excessive ballot spoilage under RCV, their specific claim is that only one 
ballot was "uncounted." Now, given the context of that claim, you might assume that 
"uncounted" and "spoiled" are being used as synonyms for each other. 
Not so.
Let's check the report again.
</p><blockquote>
Of the 45,968 total ballots cast, there were 1,888 spoiled ballots and 2,958 voter error 
ballots (2009 Election Statistics, n.d.), which indicates ballots with voter errors 
specific to Ranked Choice Voting, including overvote, repeat candidate, skipped ranking 
and undervote (Minneapolis Method for Hand-Counting RCV Ballot Sorter &amp; Counter, n.d.). 
Comparatively, during the general municipal election in 2005, there were 755 
spoiled ballots of the total 70,987 absentee and in-person voters 
(Voter Turnout and Registration, 2005). In 2009, there was only one ballot cast 
that was totally defective and not counted. This was a ballot where no 
ovals were filled in and a handwritten essay written in red crayon on it. 
Excluded from this analysis are any ballots not counted due to failure to 
comply with the rules regarding absentee ballots.
These ballots were not opened to ascertain voter intent.
That is the "one ballot" they're talking about. There were 1,888 spoiled ballots, 
a <b>more than 380% increase in spoilage over the previous election</b>, 
but never mind that! Because only one guy wrote on their ballot in crayon that year, that 
means those 1,888 don't really count against anything.
</blockquote><p>
The <b>truth</b> is, RCV nearly <a href="SPRates.html#minn">quadrupled</a>
the number of spoiled ballots in Minneapolis, 
and there would have been a ten-fold increase had the election been machine-counted 
rather than hand-counted. That alone aught to be enough to disqualify RCV as an 
election method, but there are 
<a href="Burlington.html">plenty</a>
<a href="http://leastevil.blogspot.com/2010/12/instant-majority.html">of</a> 
<a href="http://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/02/irv-uniquely-poor-choice-for-centrists.html">other</a> 
<a href="http://leastevil.blogspot.com/2009/09/irv-has-surprise-for-you.html">reasons</a>
for it, too.
</p><p>
So, I'm upgrading O'Connor's and Schulze's "damned lie" to "statistic".
