<H2> Voting for show business awards such as Oscars, Emmys, and Tonys </H2>

<blockquote><small>
(<a href="RangeVoting.html">Return to main page</a>)
</small></blockquote>
<p>
The "OSCARs" (Academy Awards for Cinema) almost certainly have been using 
suboptimal voting systems.
The purpose of this page is to collect suspicious historical OSCAR examples and
consider how well different voting systems would (and did) handle them.
</p><p>
<small>
<b>News flash</b> (January 2013): 
after this page was written, and perhaps influenced by it, the OSCARs switched to 
<a href="RRV.html#oscar">reweighted range voting</a> to select winners in the Visual Effects category.
</small>
</p><p>
<b>Warning:</b> 
I am not a film expert, and have not done enough research about OSCARs.  Therefore, it is quite 
possible that some of the examples on this page contain stupid errors or misunderstandings by me.
I am presenting them <i>only</i>
as fuel for future research by people who understand more than I do
about films, and <i>not</i> as the "final word."  Also, the actual OSCAR vote totals have
generally (always?) been kept <i>secret</I>, which makes analysis more difficult.
<b>Caveat Emptor.</b>
</p>
</p><p>
<small>
<b>Update</b> (Feb. 2014): 
A <a href="OscarMistakesAtlanticMag.html">collection</a> 
of alleged OSCAR mistakes which <i>was</i> made by genuine film experts, was compiled by
<i>The Atlantic</i> magazine.  It includes several overlaps with my collection
below (as well as several mistakes made by their "experts").
</small>

<p>
The current (2012) OSCAR <b>voting system</b> is basically: 
<ul><li>
Hare/Droop STV-PR is used to produce 5 "nominees," 
</li><li>
(Second election, done later) <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a>
voting among those 5 selects the winner.
</li></ul>
<p>
However, it is not that simple; e.g.
in some award-categories other systems are used.
Unfortunately:
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a>
voting suffers from well-known pathologies such as "vote splitting,"  "cloning," and
"reversal failure."
STV-PR sometimes can <a href="PRcond.html">fail</a> to nominate clear "beats-all" winners
while 
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> would usually avoid those failures.
</p>
<p>
<b>A plausibly better system:</b> would be 
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> to select the nominees and then
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
to choose the winner.
</p>
<blockquote><small>
<b>News flash</b> (August-Sept. 2009): The academy just changed 
its voting system for <b>"best picture"</b> to now have 
10 (not 5) nominees, and the final vote among the 10 will now be conducted using 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting</a>.  However, as far as I understand, all 
<i>other</i>
award categories will stay with the old voting system(s) and 5 nominees.  IRV suffers numerous
<a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html">pathologies</a>.   I personally am optimistic that 
this rule change will yield a substantial performance improvement, but doubt the new rules
are optimal.   It's plausible that embarrassing pathologies like "thwarted majority paradox" will
occur (just as they did in the <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington VT mayor</a> election of 2009)
and it is a pity to sacrifice RRV's and range voting's boons of granting voters
variable <i>strengths of preference</i> and the ability to <i>withhold judgment</i>
on movies that voter feels too ignorant about.
</small></blockquote>

<h3> (Presumed) Goals of the voting &amp; nomination systems </h3>

<p>
Being "nominated" is itself a (lesser) "award."   Their foremost goal probably is 
to generate "buzz" i.e. publicity to benefit the movie industry.   If the nominees are 
more diverse, then there presumably would be greater buzz and greater overall summed 
benefit for the industry.  That is why a <a href="PropRep.html">PR</a> voting system,
which to some extent sacrifices quality to get a more-representative/diverse sample, is
probably a good idea for nomination process.
</p><p>
To see that, compare
</p><ol type="a"> 
<li>
Suppose they nominated 5 war movies (non-diverse). In that case, the Public would probably 
figure "I'm not interested in seeing 5 war movies, I'll only go to one."  
Result: not a lot of summed benefit for the industry. 
</li><li>
They nominate 5 diverse movies.  Public might actually be interested in seeing all 5.
Result: much larger summed-benefit for industry.
</li></ol>
<p>
However, it also is desirable for the nominees to include "the best," otherwise the system
embarrassingly fails to nominate the best film (which
has <a href="#failnom">happened</a>).
<hr>
<p>
Here are some books, academic papers, and 
newspaper pieces about the OSCAR voting system and its foibles.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="OscarNYT02.html">French Twist: A Fair Way to Pick Oscars?</a>
this was a 17 March 2002 <i>New York Times</i> article by Rick Lyman
about NYU politics 
professor Steven J. Brams claiming the Oscars should be done with "approval voting" 
rather than plurality voting.
Brams says he can't believe <i>Rocky</i> would really have beat <i>Taxi Driver</i> in 1972 in
a head-to-head race; this had to be some kind of vote-split pathology, e.g. between
Taxi and the also-excellent <i>All the President's Men</I> and <i>Network</i>.
(Personally, I must agree with Brams: <i>Rocky</i> stunk.)
We can see how range voting would have done by checking the ratings on
<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Movies</a>,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/">internet movie database</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/apocalypse_now/">rotten tomatoes</a>.
The results support Brams's claim <i>Taxi Driver</i> was best:
<table bgcolor="lightgreen">
<tr><th>Movie</th><th>Yahoo users</th><th>IMDb raters (0-10)</th><th>RottenTomatoes.com</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bound for Glory</td><td>B (based on 55 raters)</td><td>7.3 (from 1218 raters)</td><td>7.3 (from 17 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rocky</td><td><b>B+</b> (from 40187 raters)</td><td>8.0 (from 64828 raters)</td><td>8.1 (from 41 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>All President's Men</td><td>B (from 14366 raters)</td><td>8.0 (from 25842 raters)</td><td><b>8.9</b> (from 39 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Network</td><td><b>B+</b> (from 1276 raters)</td><td>8.1 (from 22899 raters)</td><td>8.0 (from 42 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Taxi Driver</td><td><b>B+</b> (from 20830 raters)</td><td><b>8.6</b> (from 116049 raters)</td><td>8.8 (from 47 reviews)</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
</li><li>
The NY Times piece was based on 
<a href="assets/documents/BramsHagerAcademyAwards.pdf">this unpublished paper (pdf)</a> 
by S.J.Brams and Paul Hager.  They say:
<blockquote>
The most famous, or
infamous, incident [was] in 1950. That year, both Bette Davis and Anne
Baxter received Best Actress nominations for <i>All About Eve</i>. When Judy
Holliday became the surprise winner in <i>Born Yesterday</i>, it was widely believed
that Davis and Baxter had split the vote.
</blockquote>
Brams &amp; Hager also question the Academy's choice
of <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> as best picture of 1979.
Again their view is supported by the internet ratings, and again a vote-split seems the 
plausible cause:
<table bgcolor="lightgreen">
<tr><th>Movie</th><th>Yahoo users</th><th>IMDb raters (0-10)</th><th>RottenTomatoes.com</th></tr>
<tr><td>Norma Rae</td><td>B (from 336 raters)</td><td>7.2 (from 2860 raters)</td><td>7.6 (from 19 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>All that Jazz</td><td><b>B+</b> (from 346 raters)</td><td>7.5 (from 7555 raters)</td><td>7.4 (from 31 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kramer v. Kramer</td><td>B (based on 1831 raters)</td><td>7.7 (from 17625 raters)</td><td>7.9 (from 32 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Breaking Away</td><td>B (from 7840 raters)</td><td>7.6 (from 7523 raters)</td><td><b>8.3</b> (from 33 reviews)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apocalypse Now</td><td><b>B+</b> (from 4308 raters)</td><td><b>8.6</b> (from 136199 raters)</td><td>7.7 (from 77 reviews)</td></tr>

in <i>Interfaces</i> 34,3 (2004) 226-234 by professors W.V.Gehrlein &amp; H.V.Kler.
They cited a USA Today article which had
trouble seeing how Marisa Tomei won best supporting actress for <i>My Cousin Vinny</i> in 1992,
and had speculated it
must have been another vote-split pathology caused by using plurality voting instead of scoring.

<br><br>
</li><li>
Here's an interesting example where <i>range voting</i> (unusually for OSCARs!)
was used as a nominating procedure [but note: we recommend range voting for <i>single</I>-winner 
elections and it is not clear to us what is best for multiwinner elections such
as OSCAR nominations, plausibly
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> is better] and complaints followed:
<i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine (early 2009) wrote:
<blockquote>
The biggest Bruce Springsteen controversy of the season...
Springsteen fans are shocked that his stunning song
"The Wrestler" (from the film of the same name) didn't get an Oscar
nod &ndash; despite the fact that he won a Golden Globe for the tune.
Instead of selecting five nominees (as in most other categories), the
Acedym chose only three: Peter Gabriel's "Down to Earth" from <i>WALL-E</i>,
and two from <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>.
<br><br>
<i>The Wrestler</i> may have been a victim of the Oscars' complex
nominating rules. The Academy music branch watched all 49 eligible
songs in a clip reel provided for them. Then they rated the tunes on a
scale of 6.25 to 10 &ndash; and only the movies with averages of 8.25 or
better made the cut. That system seems to give an edge to certain
films. "A song that has a performance aspect is going to do better
than one that doesn't," says Oscar nominee Danny Elfman's agent,
Richard Kraft. "It's hard to compete with the music video at the end
of <i>Slumdog</i>, while in 'The Wrestler', you've got the names of key grips
scrolling by."

<h3> Some more examples of suspicious "final round" voting for "best picture" Oscar </h3>

<a name="y1941"></a>
<p><b>1941:</b>
<i>Citizen Kane</i>, which has often been cited as best film ever, got little
Academy recognition.  It won "best screenplay" but nothing else in spite of being 
nominated for many
other academy awards including best picture.  That year the
Best Picture was
<i>How green was my valley</i>
while the other nominees were
<i>Blossoms in the Dust</i>, <i>Here Comes Mr. Jordan</i>, <i>Hold Back the Dawn</i>,
<i>The Little Foxes</i>, <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, <i>One Foot in Heaven</i>,
<i>Sergeant York</i>, and <i>Suspicion</i>.
</p>
<p><small>
[I personally found <i>Valley</i> to be sickeningly saccharine and utterly unrealistic,
but admit I quit watching it after about 20 minutes.]
</small></p>
<p>
<i>How green was my valley</i> holds a 7.9 rating from IMDb (5568 raters as of 2008)
while <i>Kane</i> has 8.6 (113062 raters),
<i>Maltese Falcon</i> 8.4 (40259 raters),
and <i>Sgt. York</i> 8.0 (4822 raters).
</p><P>
With this many nominees including two strong films in <i>Kane</i> and <i>Maltese</i>,
plurality voting was highly likely to malfunction.   
I find it very hard to believe <i>Kane</i> would have lost
a head-to-head race versus <i>Valley</i>.
</p>
<a name="y1944"></a>
<p>
<b>1944:</b> The too-sweet musical <i>Going My Way</i> (8.2)
won best picture (also best actor, Bing Crosby, and best supporting actor Barry Fitzgerald,
best story for Leo McCarey, and best screenplay for Frank Butler and Frank Cavett).
Meanwhile
Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece <i>Double Indemnity</i> 
got nothing.   (It was nominated for best actress, music, director, picture, cinematography.)
But over time, the raters on IMDb thought differently.
As of June 2009, they gave <i>Going My Way</i> a rating of 7.5 whereas
<i>Double Indemnity</i> got 8.6.
Similarly on rottentomatoes.com,
<i>Double Indemnity</i> got 8.7 while <i>Going my way</I> got 7.1.
</p>
<p>
<b>1950:</b> 
<i>All about Eve</i> won best picture. But it got an 8.4 rating on IMDb.
Meanwhile <i>Sunset Boulevard</I> got 8.7.
I admit, these IMDb ratings are close enough that you cannot call this a robbery.
</p>
<p><b>1957:</b>
<i>12 angry men</i> was rated 8.8 by 78K IMDbers.   Although nominated,
it lost to <i>Bridge on the River Kwai</i>
which 45K IMDbers rated only 8.4.  The other nominees were
<i>Witness for the Prosecution</i> (8.3),
<i>Peyton Place</i> (7.2), and 
<i>Sayonara</i> (7.2).
This decision, since it is only an 0.4 rating-gap on IMDb, might be defensible.  
However, one cannot help suspecting
that the real reason for <i>Bridge</i>'s victory
was a vote split between <i>Men</i> and <i>Witness</i>, which were both good legal dramas
and thus perhaps (in vote-theory terminology) "clones."
<i>Bridge</i>, as the only war movie, presumably did not suffer any vote-split.
</p><p><b>2011:</b>
See <a href="SilverOscar.html">this</a>
analysis of Nate Silver's forecasting analysis of the 2011 Oscars, versus what
actually happened. It appears that the IRV voting system used in the final round, robbed
<i>Toy Story 3</i> of what would have been a historic best-picture award (first ever
victory for an animated film).  The official winner was <i>The King's Speech.</i>
</p>

<a name="failnom"></a>
<h3> Suspicious examples where great films failed even to be nominated </h3>

<p>
Alfred Hitchkock's famous <i>Psycho</i> (1960)
&ndash; often said to be best of its kind of all time
and a classic &ndash; failed to win any OSCAR and failed even to get
nominated as best picture.
</p><p>
Monty Python's <i>Life of Brian</i> (1979) won numerous votes as best comedy
of all time &ndash; no OSCAR, not even a nomination.
</p><p>
<i>The Searchers</i> (1956) was named Greatest Western of all time by the
American Film Institute in 2008.  No OSCARs, not even a nomination.
</p><p>
<i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</I> (1966), often also said to be best
western ever, and ranked
as 4th best film ever and as best western ever by IMDb raters (as of January
2009) &ndash; no OSCAR, not even a nomination.
</p><p>
In 1959, <i>Ben-Hur</i> (8.2) 
won best picture, 
defeating 
<i>Anatomy of a murder</i> (8.1),
<i>Nun's story</i> (7.5),
<i>Room at the top</i> (7.9),
and <i>Diary of Anne Frank</i> (7.6).
[Year 2009 IMDb ratings shown in parentheses.]
<b>But</b> three excellent rivals failed
even to be nominated:
<i>Some Like It Hot</i> (8.4),
<i>North by Northwest</i> (8.6), 
and
<i>Wild Strawberries (Smultronst&auml;llet)</i> (8.3),
<b>all</b> of which would have defeated <b>all</b> of the nominees
in terms of year-2009 IMDb ratings!
<!-- The problem here may have been a lack of emphasis by the voting system on quaity. -->
Indeed in 2000, the American Film Institute listed <i>Some Like It Hot</i>
as the greatest American comedy film of all time.
</p><p>
When <b>Bette Davis</b> 
failed to land a nomination as best actress for <i>Of Human Bondage</i> (1934),
there was an outcry, which led to a write-in vote for her being permitted
despite her non-nomination. (In the final tally, at a time 
when the Academy made the votes public, she finished third.) 
However, write-in voting has been banned since 1936.
</p><p>
In January 2013, 
Ben Affleck won both the 
Hollywood foreign press association's
"Golden Globe" <i>and</i>
the
Broadcast Film Critics' Association 
"best director" 
cinema awards
for his movie <i>Argo</i>
(rated 8.1 by 64590 internet raters on IMDb and <b>96</b> on the <tt>rottentomatoes.com</tt>
"tomatometer").
However, oddly, he failed even to achieve <i>nomination</i> for the more-prestigious 
OSCAR best-director award announced later in that same month.  
[Also not nominated: Kathryn Bigelow (<i>Zero dark thirty</i> 7.7, 93) 
and Quentin Tarantino (<i>Django unchained</i> <b>8.7</b>, 88).]
The five nominees were (in no particular order):
</p><ol><li>
Steven Spielberg (<i>Lincoln</i> 8.0, 91)
</li><li>
Ang Lee (<i>Life of Pi</i> 8.3, 89; ultimate <b>winner</b>)
</li><li>
David O. Russell (<i>Silver linings playbook</i> 8.2, 91)
</li><li>
Benh Zeitlin (<i>Beasts of the Southern Wild</i> 7.5, 86)
</li><li>
Michael Haneke (<i>Amour</i> 8.1, 93).
</li></ol>
This surprising
discrepancy caused various conspiracy theories, as well as blame-it-on-the-STV-voting-system
theories, to appear in the press.  For example in the <i>Guardian</i>,
</p><blockquote>
It all rather depends on the reason Affleck was snubbed in the first place. If
<i>Argo</i> has simply been overrated by the Oscar commentariat, that's one thing. But
some are suggesting that Affleck came a cropper of the preferential voting
system of the nomination process which rewards small but passionate groups of
supporters &ndash; those for Michael Haneke or Behn Zeitlin, for example. Furthermore,
voters may have felt they had to choose between Affleck's CIA thriller and
Kathryn Bigelow's, which may have had the effect of cancelling each other out.
The result was an accidental snub rather than an intentional diss.
</blockquote><p>
Meanwhile  the <i>New York Times</i>
(17 January 2013 page C1) went with a headline
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/movies/awardsseason/ben-affleck-now-an-underdog-with-argo-is-on-the-rebound.html">A Snub by Oscars? Affleck Has an Answer</a>,
the <i>NY Post</i> and <i>Huffington Post</i> and both
<a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/379531/sorry-ben-affleck-best-director-oscar-can-t-be-won-by-write-in-votes-at-least-not-yet">Eonline</a> and
<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/argo-director-ben-afflecks-oscar-412794">HollywoodReporter.com</a>
all also called this a "snub" for Affleck &ndash;
and said many were demanding "write-in votes" (currently illegal
under OSCAR voting rules) to
allow Affleck a chance to win despite not being nominated.  E.g. the latter commented
</p><blockquote>
Either it's time to dismiss the Globes as any kind of legitimate prognosticator or time for 
the Academy to recognize it has made a mistake and do the right thing: reintroduce a write-in vote.
</blockquote><p>
One way in which even a <i>clearly best</i> candidate could fail to receive an Oscar
nomination is demonstrated by this pathology example:
<a href="PRcond.html">/PRcond.html</a>.
It also is possible with their PR-STV system
for a "vote split" to trigger that same kind of pathology,
e.g. eliminating two candidates who
otherwise would have been top, because neither has enough top-rank votes to
survive round #1.
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>, 
however, does not suffer from (or anyhow far less) either of those two
pathologies.
</p><p>
Did some such pathology happen in the 2013 OSCARs?
