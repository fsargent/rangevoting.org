<H2> Why the Constitutional party needs range voting (Executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Range voting appears to be supported by the Bible to a greater extent
than
any other voting system.
</li>
<li>
The founding fathers who wrote the US Constitution were aware of other
voting systems and also aware
that deciding which was the best was difficult.  
They appear to have intentionally <i>not</i> specified in the
constitution which
system the US should use, precisely because they did not know at that
time which was the best.
</li>
<li>
Range Voting would have gotten Constitution 2004 Presidential
candidate Michael Peroutka 50 times more votes than he got under
plurality
and 6 times as many as he would have gotten under Approval Voting.
</li>
<li>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
would be a huge mistake for Constitutionalists since it just leads to
2-party domination
just like the plurality system.
</li>
<li>
Without a change in the voting system to get rid of Duverger's law
of 2-party domination, Constitutionalists and all third-party candidates
will
forever have no chance.  There is not a single third-party
member of the House, Senate, or high Executive branch  (zero out of
about 600 people).
</li>
<li>
The plurality voting system is in fact <i>diabolical</i> because it
causes:
(a) voters who want to vote
Constitution actually make the US <i>less</i> Constitutional by doing
so,
or (b) if they vote major party, then that kills off the Constitution
party.
<li>
So it is a matter of survival: you must push range voting.
</li>
</ol>
