<H1> Tim Pawlenty drops out of the USA 2012 presidential race  </H1>

<p>
Gov. Tim Pawlenty was supposedly one of the top, if not the top, Republican
candidate for
president, said the pundits.
But on 14 August 2011 he withdrew from the race, after a disappointing performance in
the much-ballyhooed Ames Iowa GOP straw poll.

This is just absurd. The race hadn't even <i>started</i> yet.  Some
probable major contestants like Palin hadn't even declared they were running yet! 
Perry declared he was running on the day of the straw poll (in which he was not 
even officially entered). Not a single primary had been held yet, and the first would be
6 months later.
</p><p>
I claim it is the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting system causing this absurdity. It places
such a huge <a href="RL2parties.html#cash">premium</a>
on "appearing to be a frontrunner" (so that donors and voters can feel their donations/votes
will not be wasted) that Pawlenty felt the
need to drop out even
at this incredibly early stage, after doing poorly in a baloney GOP straw poll
with virtually no meaning whatever.  
</p><blockquote>

The Ames straw poll is mainly a fundraising gimmick
by the Iowa GOP, which in 2011 charged $30 for the "privilege" of voting in it, plus
"rent" fees assessed to each candidate.   Bachmann, in addition to her rent fee
(minimum rent was $15,000) also
paid the $30 voting fees for 6000 voters &ndash; of which, note, at least 
1177 voted for somebody else!
The previous Ames straw poll (2008) was won by Mitt Romney,
who paid over a <i>million dollars</i> to engineer said "victory," bussing
in thousands of supporters from all over the state (free wining and dining for them all).
However, this did not greatly benefit him, since John McCain, who had finished 10th
in that straw poll with approximately
2% of Romney's vote-count, won the GOP presidential nomination with over twice Romney's
votes.
(Romney in 2011 got wise and decided not to waste his money competing in the Ames poll.)
This poll is about as far as it is possible to get from "accurate professional poll techniques."

This sort of randomness and its consequences are hurting the USA tremendously.

An interesting data point which got far less press coverage, was the straw poll at the
"Heartland Liberty Fest" (Omaha Nebraska 6 August 2011).  It was conducted using 
0-to-10 <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, not plurality voting, and only 
assessed a $2 fee per vote.  The results 
are in the table on the right.

Pawlenty actually <i>won</i> that poll.
