<H2> What is wrong with US media? And how range voting would affect that </H2>

<b>Q.[From an alternative-media guy]</b> &nbsp;
I think the real problem in our "democracy" is not the
voting system, but the mainstream media.  If people have no
idea what is actually happening, then no voting system can
fix it.  As of a few months ago [this was written in May 2006],
a very large proportion of
voters still thought that WMD had been found in Iraq.  And
that there were real ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
</p>
<p>
No voting system can give good results in the presence of
voter ignorance and misconceptions.
</p>
<p>
This is why the focus of my work has been on promoting
non-mainstream media wherever possible. 
</p>

<b>A.</b>
That is all true.  However, look deeper.  <i>Why</i> do you think the
media has failed in this respect?   <i>Why</i> do you think the voters
are ignorant? <i>Why</I> are the US media to a considerable extent becoming
the lapdogs of our political leadership?
</P>

<p>
<b>(a)</b> First of all, communications are technically
better  and cheaper now than ever 
and the info re WMD and Al Qaeda etc was widely available.  So,
no, sorry, I do not blame the media per se for that problem.  That is the
fault of something besides the media.  And I think there is a reason for
voter apathy in the USA, and it has a lot to do with lack of competitiveness
and lack of debate.  (Proof: Compare <a href="NonVoters.html#turnout">other countries</a>, QED.)
That in turn
is caused by the voting system which is <a href="Strangle.html">less democratic</a>
in the USA than almost anyplace.
</p>

<p>
<b>(b)</b> But I do blame the media for not covering important issues and
points of view basically at all.  For example, 
<a href="http://hubbert.mines.edu/">oil</a> is going to reach production
peak in 2010-2020 causing a worldwide economic crisis.  
(See also <a href="RVPapers.html">Simmons' book</a>. Later note: this conclusion has been delayed
by the advent of "fracking" technology.)
The world is massively
overpopulated and subsisting on nonrenewable fuel and water.
Antibiotics are put by the ton into animal feeds risking a massive drug
resistant plague.  Range voting is an extremely important
issue again not covered by the media at all.  All of these issues
are so important they literally could cause something close to
the end of the world.  They
get almost zero media coverage.   For another example, the whole reason
why the WTO is a bad idea and is not working well, is basically not
discussed in the mainstream media, although you can find out more
by reading <a href="RVPapers.html#Palast">Palast's book<a/>.
</p>
<p>
OK.  Now there is a reason for (b), and it is in large part again due to
forces external to the media &ndash; specifically, the media covers what is "news",
which means "what the main political decision makers are doing" &ndash; and they
are not working on these issues.   And then the lack of media coverage causes them to
continue not working on them, which reinforces the vicious cycle.
</p>
<p>
Now, if we had range voting, then we would have other viewpoints which <i>would</i>
then be important and news.
The USA's third parties are talking about many of the just-mentioned issues,
but nobody covers them.   The reason nobody covers them is because
those parties have no chance.  The reason they have no chance is our voting
system and hence our media!
</p>
<p>
Q.E.D:  fix the voting system, and the media problem (b) will to a very
considerable degree, automatically fix itself!!  Get it?   The world
is a dynamical
system and you have to identify the lever that is light enough to
actually be pulled,
which can alter the dynamics.
</P>
<p>
Do not fix the voting system?  The media problem
to a very considerable degree will automatically reassert itself
and defeat efforts by people like you to make alternative media.
Why do you think "alternative media" is not
the same thing as mainstream media, if it is so much better?  There
are reasons for that.  Your alternative media simply cannot get big
enough to be mainstream media, unless it strongly responds to market
forces.  Those market forces say we care about news, which means what
the top two parties are discussing.  End of story.  You cannot overcome
this.   100s of years of history prove that the vast statistical forces
that force these things are successful.   If range voting, then dynamics change.
</p>
<p>
<b>(c)</b>
Why are the USA media such compliant lapdogs?  (Compare the media in other countries if
you don't believe me.  Heck, just listen to press interviewers
grilling politicians in other countries
like the UK.  There is no comparison to the way they usually act here in the USA.)
I believe a large part of the reason is ultimately traceable to the voting system
and the USA's massive consequent 2-party domination.
Follow the logic:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Market forces say media needs to cover "news," i.e. what politicians from
the top 2 parties  are doing.  
</li><li>
White House can and does threaten to cut off
White House press privileges, stop leaks, refuse to deliver info, 
etc if media lapdogs do not behave.
</li><li>
Media is intensely vulnerable to that pressure since they have nowhere else to go for their
news (to some approximation).  That is especially true in the current 2006 climate
with <a href="OneParty.html">one-party domination</a> of all branches (Executive, Senate,
House, and Supreme Court) of US government.
</lI>
</ol>
Now consider the new situation under <i>range voting</i>.  Then:
More than two parties can make news.  More issues are at play and relevant to
more candidacies which are more credible.  More parties need to cooperate
more often leading to less one-party control and monopoly.
That all adds up to less pressure on and less monopoly control over the press, and a
more interesting and important role for the press, under range voting.
Moral: get range voting and the "media lapdog" problem will largely solve itself.
