<H2> Bayesian regret (executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
"Bayesian regret" is the "gold standard" for comparing single-winner election methods.
</li><li>
Roughly, the "Bayesian regret" of an election method E is the "expected avoidable human 
unhappiness" caused by using it.
</li><li>
The Bayesian regret of E can be <i>mathematically</i> defined.
</li><li>
It can be measured quantitatively by computer simulations.
</li><li>
No assumption need be made that voters are "sincere" or "well informed."
Bayesian regret can be evaluated for any kind of voter strategic behavior and any 
level of voter informedness.
</li><li>
No simplistic probabilistic assumption need be made such as
that we have "random uniform elections" ("impartial culture"); you can put in arbitrarily
sophisticated probability distributions, "issue spaces," "utility generators," etc
(and we have done quite a lot of that including 
<a href="IEVS/IEVS.c">IEVS</a> features the world's first "reality based" statistics)
</li><li>
Even if  utilities for different humans
are regarded as inherently unknowable, unmeasurable, and
inapproximable by any physical/biological process, 
<a href="ArrowLawr.html#fruit">that would not affect</a> the validity
of the Bayesan Regret methodology and its conclusions one iota.
</li><li>
Those measurements have been <a href="UniqBest.html">done</a>
and range voting is robustly the best
single-winner voting system (i.e. has the least Bayesian regret) among
all commonly proposed alternatives.
</li><li>
Bayesian Regrets values are "meaningless numbers"?  Well, no.  They're deaths.  Wasted money.
Illness.  Crimes.  Devastation. Poverty.
Bayesian Regret encapsulates everything you don't want.  Yes, it encapsulates it
in a <i>number</i>. But that doesn't make it any less real.  That makes it <i>more</I>
real because it is quantifiable rather than puffery.   Bayesian Regret is plenty real.
As real as your death.
