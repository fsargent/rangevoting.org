<H2> Voting honestly in IRV (Instant Runoff Voting)

In this 21-voter <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> election,
<b>B wins</b> <small>(by 15-to-8 after G is eliminated)</small>.
 But if the 3 voters in the last line had <b>not voted</b>,
then <b>G would have won</b> (which those voters would have preferred).
<small>(Because N is eliminated then G beats B by 11-to-7.)</small>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
This
scenario also shows how the 3 voters in the last line would be motivated to "betray" 
their true-favorite N (Nader) by dishonestly voting G>N>B or G>B>N
to rank their "lesser evil"
G (Gore) dishonestly top;
then G would win, whereas their honest vote N>G>B "spoils it"
by causing both G and N to lose. 
This refutes the myth that IRV "cures" that "lesser-evil/spoiler"
problem with plurality voting.  (<a href="IRVStratPf.html#irv">Computer simulations</a>
show that Favorite Betrayal scenarios arise
in 3-candidate <a href="RandElect.html">random IRV elections</a> about 19.6% of the time.)
</p>

<p>
Indeed this illustrates how IRV can suffer an even <i>worse</i> kind of spoiler
scenario than the usual one.
In the usual spoiler scenario, if you vote Nader, then your second-favorite ("Gore")
and Nader both lose, but you could've made Gore win by voting Gore.  But at least,
voting Nader did not make it <i>worse</i> than not voting at all.
With IRV, your honest vote <i>can</i> (and here does) actually make it worse than not voting.

How common is that?  I.e. how common is it in 3-candidate IRV elections that
some set of co-voting voters, by voting honestly, obtain a 
worse election result (in their view) than if they had not voted at all?
This question was analysed by 
Depankar Ray: 
On the practical possibility of a "no show paradox" under the single transferable vote, 
Math'l Social Sciences 11,2 (1986) 183-189.
Ray found that <i>in situations where the IRV and plain-<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
winner differ</i>, then (under very mild probabilistic assumptions) the probability of this
happening was exactly 50%.  That seems a serious indictment of IRV voting as an "improvement"
over plurality voting.
