<b>Comments</b> <P>

Greece got its first monarchical Constitution in 1844, its second in 1864. The version above, which in its original was promulgated on 14 June 1911, was a revision of the 1864 Constitution. Yet another revision took place in 1958, to be repealed by the Republican Constitution of 1975. <P>

In addition to the Constitution the house law of 1438/1887, later replaced by leg. decree 1298/1949 made &laquo;provisions about membership of the royal family&raquo; and also included an article &laquo;stating that any member of the royal family (as defined in the statute) had to have the King's consent to marry.&raquo; (source: Yannis, <i>alt.talk.royalty</I> 29 April 2002.) <P>
