<H2> Answer to Puzzle #20: Condorcet cycles in real elections </H2>

<p>
<b>Puzzle:</b>
How often do &quot;<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycles</a>&quot; 
arise in real elections with rank-order ballots? Give some prominent real historical examples 
of such elections.
</p>
<p>
<b>Answer 1:
For public elections</b>, this is unknown.  It is very difficult to find an example both because
they are rare (few percent?) and because, even when they do occur, how are you going to know it?
You could know it if there were polls assessing all pairwise preferences, but
such polls are only conducted rarely.
</p>
<p>
You might be able to make a stab at this by examining 
<a href="http://www.electionsireland.org">Irish</a> rank-order-ballot data
(which the Irish have recently started releasing on the internet in some cases
<a href="http://www.guthanphobail.net/">1</a>).
</p>
<p>
You would have to examine at least 1000 elections to get good-enough statistical error bars.
(And, even then your results would be attackable as not "real" since really these votes
were almost all or all cast in <i>non</i>Condorcet, <i>multi</i>winner elections.)
We have summarized a good deal of what is known
<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Answer 2: But for legislative votes</b>, we do know that
Condorcet cycles are very common, and a major problem!
Why?  Because different factions often <i>intentionally try to create them</i>
in order to defeat some proposal.
</p>
<p>
To see what I mean, consider some proposal A. The legislature can either vote "Yea"
or vote "Nay" &ndash; and in the latter case we stay with the status quo Q.
Now suppose a majority feel A>Q so that A would (under normal circumstances) pass.
<i>But</i> of course, the opponents of A (whom we suppose can control the
order in which votes are taken, i.e. have "agenda setting power")
don't want that to happen.  So they
contrive some <i>amended</i> proposal P, known as the "poison pill,"
which the majority feel is
superior to A, i.e. P>A.   The majority dutifully get rid of A and replace
it with the amended proposal P.  But then P fails to pass because &ndash; and this
was the point &ndash; there is a Condorcet cycle P>A>Q>P  and so the majority feels Q>P
and defeats the proposal.
</p>
<p>
OK? This is so common that the word "poison pill" had to be
<i>invented</i> to describe such amendments!
Some US Congressional recent examples are
<a href="PoisonPill1.html">this</a>,
<a href="PoisonPill2.html">this</a>,
<a href="PoisonPill3.html">this</a>, and
<a href="PoisonPill4.html">this</a>.
One of the latest stunts of this nature was the use of the gun lobby as a 
<a href="PoisonPill5.html">poison pill to
torpedo giving Washington DC taxpayers voting rights</a>; this was actually a variant 
which successfully poisoned the bill in spite of the fact that the 
leadership with agenda-setting power actually was in <i>favor</i> of the bill.
A <a href="poisonpillparade.pdf">parade of poison pills</a> were proposed by Republican
Party leaders (including Bill Frist) for attachment to bills to raise the minimum wage
for the first time in over 10 years (during which time, Congress had raised its own salaries
by over $32,000). These succeeded several times in killing the minimum wage increase.
</p>
<p>
W.H.Riker [<i>Arrow's theorem and some samples of the paradox of voting</i>,
Arnold Foundation Monograph, Dallas, Southern Methodist University 1965]
gave several less-recent Congressional examples. 
For example, the 17<sup>th</sup>
Amendment to the US Constitution (direct election of senators) would
have passed Congress 10 years before it actually did if not
for a poison pill amended-Amendment which was devised to make it become less 
acceptable to Southerners.  The only reason the 17th eventually passed was the composition
of Congress eventually changed,
</p>

<p>
Of course, if Congress employed <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> among A,P, and Q,
then this problem would vanish.
