<H2> Approval voting elected the Greek parliament 1864-1926 </H2>

I only recently found out from Kopfermann 1991
that the Greek parliament was elected by means of 
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>
using single-member elections in districts, during 1864-1926.
</p><blockquote>
Klaus Kopfermann:

This is by far the longest duration use of approval voting to elect
a federal government during the last 300 years.
The US political science professors who "invented" approval voting
during the late 1970s had all been unaware of this and it was not
mentioned in the only 2 books I know of devoted to the topic of
approval voting.
</p><p>
<b>The natural questions</b> then are:
</p><ol>
<li>
Was Kopfermann correct? Can we independently confirm his claim?
</li><li>
Why was the approval system adopted, and 
why was it eventually abandoned?
</li><li>
What happened to Greece during those 61 years (plus somewhat earlier and later years)?
</li><li>
What happened about parties in parliament &ndash; was there 2-party
domination, or what?
</li></ol>
<p>
Some of the answers are easy, others not, but here's the quick <b>summary</b>:
</p>
</p><ol><li item="2">
Kopfermann was correct.  We have found two independent
<a href="#photoevid">confirmations</a>.
And previously,
during 1844-1864, it appears Greece employed
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.
</li><li item="1">
It appears that 
Greece's 1864 decision to adopt its approval voting system
was motivated by 
<ol type="a"><li>
Its alleged prior use in the Ionian Islands (which were ceded to Greece
in 1864, immediately becoming at the time the wealthiest and economically
best off part of Greece) while under the rule of 
<a href="VenHist.html">Venice</a> from 1202-1797.
</li><li>
Hopes that the "color coded" and ballotless approval system would be both
less corrupted/fraudulent, more private, and
more usable by illiterate voters, than plurality voting.
</li><li>
Conceivably, although I have no evidence for it,
this decision also had roots in previous Greek history, namely Ancient
 <a href="SpartaExec.html">Sparta</a>'s reliance on <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting.
</li></ol>
Greece ultimately abandoned approval as part of an ill-fated switchover to a
<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a> (PR) system.
The switchover to PR was probably motivated by the large defeat of Venizelos' Liberal Party in terms of
seat count in parliament, <i>despite</i> the Liberals actually winning a slight majority 
of the <i>votes</i>, in 1920.
PR systems may or may not be superior to single-winner systems including approval and
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting.
However, PR wasn't superior in this particular case, in the sense that soon after the switch to PR
Greece collapsed into chaos.  They would have been better off staying in the same situation they'd 
previously been in &ndash; if that were possible, which it might not have been, 
considering the mounting overall chaos at the time.
</li><li>
Overall, Greece seems to have improved greatly during the approval-voting era, although the
improvement was initially frustratingly slow.
And soon after this era ended, Greece got substantially worse.
So if the Greek experience is used to judge approval voting &ndash; which is a dangerous thing
to do  since it is "only one datapoint" and since the improvements and worsenings might well
have been caused by other things than approval; the historical situation was very complicated and 
stressful &ndash; then in my opinion the overall judgment would have to be positive.
</li><li>
There was a 2-party-domination (2PD) sub-era of the approval-voting era.
However, this may actually have been beneficial for Greece, and it was not 
permanent (unlike the USA's descent into 2PD under the plurality voting system, 
which unfortunately appears to be permanent).  
This 2PD was intentionally striven for by C.Trikoupis &ndash; who believed it would benefit
Greece &ndash; by in 1875 making King George I agree to the principle of 
"didolomeni," which meant that the Prime Minister from then on 
would always be from the party with the plurality in Parliament.
(Previously, the King had appointed the prime minister from among the then-serving MPs
according to his personal whim.)  Didolomeni greatly incentivized small parties to merge into
one of the two biggest because otherwise the split side would lose the power of
the prime minister.
Why did Trikoupis want 2-party domination?
EXPLAIN??
Did it work??
Indeed, Greece 
toward the end of its approval voting era elected 
Eleftherios <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos">Venizelos</a>
(1864-1936),
generally regarded as the greatest Greek statesman/leader
during the last 300 years, as prime minister.
Venizelos at that time was leading a previously unempowered and unrepresented political party.
Such a changeover would have been unthinkable in the USA under plurality voting and 2PD.  
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>Approval voting as a "stepping stone" to proportional representation?</b>
PR advocates might want to note this:
</><p>
Approval voting after 61 years served as a stepping stone in Greece
to a PR system.
This contrasts with every country that I am aware of that has been
based on plurality voting for a 61-year span, like UK, USA, India,
Canada.   Have any of them ever switched to PR?   Well, I don't know
who to count 
but it seems clear plurality is not a reliable stepping stone to PR,
it clearly often fails to do so.   Meanwhile, the only country ever to
use approval for a prolonged period during the last 300 years, Greece,
switched to PR.  So Greece is only one datapoint but as far as it goes
supports my theory approval is a better stepping stone to PR than
plurality voting is.
</p><p>
Also, approval voting was 
<a href="SovietApp.html">used</a>
near the end of the Soviet Union as part of
an experiment in democratization by M.Gorbachev (who, being no
imbecile, figured if he were going to introduce democracy, why not use
the best single-winner voting system known at the time).
This experiment did not last long because the
USSR collapsed a few years later.  The USSR's fragments then became in
many cases democracies or pseudo-democracies, I think all of them PR.
So this "datapoint" again supports (in a rather lame fashion, but supports)
the approval&rArr;PR stepping stone theory... 
which therefore seems supported by <b>100%</b> of the (very limited) available evidence.

<h3>Greek history</h3>
<p>
As I write this (2015), Greece's government
is essentially bankrupt and begging for international financial bailouts.
It had similar, albeit worse, problems during 1800-1900.
</p><p>
<b>The approval voting era</b> commenced soon after the crowning of King George I of Greece
on 30 March 1863.
<!-- 24 December 1845 – 18 March 1913. Reign began 30 March 1863. -->
He reigned until his death by assassination on 18 March 1913.
And since he was born in December 1845, George became
king at age 17.   And where did this 17 year old "George" come from?  
Not Greece.
He'd never even been to Greece and couldn't speak or read the language.
(He spoke Danish and English, with lesser knowledge of French and German.)
And he wasn't named George either.
Actually, he was "Prince Vilhelm of Schleswig-Holstein, <i>Denmark</i>," 
born in Copenhagen,
and was a cadet in the Danish royal navy,
renouned mainly for his love of pranks and good humor. 
</p><p>
However fate, more precisely European power politics, intervened.
At the London conference of August 1863, 
the Great Powers, negotiating what to do about Greece,
decided to install a king.  However, neither the Russians, English, or French
&ndash;
the three "protecting powers" of Greece (in the terminology of the day)
&ndash;
could install one of their own (or allied) princes because the other two would have objected.
And certainly a prince from some anti-aligned power (e.g. Prussia or Turkey) would
be unacceptable.
Therefore this minor Dane was chosen, probably greatly to his surprise,
as a neutral compromise.  The facts that George was young, utterly non-Greek, inexperienced,
and apparently rather vain, probably all were
considered advantageous.  (As opposed, to, say, enthroning some
experienced Greek, which of course was absurd.)
It was agreed that all George's children
were to be members of the Greek Orthodox Church &ndash; albeit a special 
exception was made for George himself, who was Lutheran &ndash;  and the monarchy 
was to be male-hereditary.
</p><p>
<b>Political situation before George I.</b>
Let's backtrack a bit.
The three "Great Powers," (England, France, and Russia)
had agreed in the "London protocol of 1830"
that Greece should nominally be independent,
but their installed (1833) King Otho 
&ndash;
also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_of_Greece">Otto</a>, 
originally a Bavarian prince who could not speak Greek, lifespan 1815-1867
&ndash; was incompetent and widely disliked.
Ultimately, in 1862, a bloodless coup was organized to depose him.
Specifically, Otho was out of the country at the time and
was prevented from returning.  (He spent the rest of his life in exile back in Bavaria.)
</p><p>
Otho was an "absolute monarch" with total power overriding (if he wished)
every other governmental body.  However in 1843 a mutiny forced him to accept (or pretend to)
the reduced status of "constitutional monarch" having to share power, to some extent, with
two houses of parliament.  The resulting constitution of March 1844 is
claimed to be the first in Europe providing universal male suffrage.
Otho however continued to try to be an absolute monarch 
by using electoral fraud, military intimidation, and terror, and generally not cooperating with or
defending the constitution.  Thomas Gallant described Otho as
"neither ruthless enough to be feared, nor compassionate enough to be loved,
nor competent enough to be respected."
</p><p>
The post-coup situation in 1862 was, however, not acceptable to the Great Powers. And apparently
the Greeks did not like it either and actually wanted a king to be given 
to them &ndash; just a better one. There was, indeed, 
a Greek plebiscite in 1862 (apparently the first Greece-wide referendum ever held;
241202 voters) finding 95% wanted the
Great Powers to give them a king, and specifically about 95% of those 95%
wanted the UK's Prince Alfred, son of
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  Alfred, was, however, unacceptable to France &amp; Russia
under the protocols of 1830 or 1832.
Hence, George I, who for some reason had received 6 votes in that plebiscite.
</p><p>
At George's enthronement, the British government announced to the joy of the Greeks
that they would cede the Ionian Islands (lying west of Greece) to Greece as a goodwill gesture.
</p><p>
<b>Whyever did Greece <i>want</i> a king?</b>
Kings were actually quite a useful thing for a European
country to have, especially if they were good ones.
If long-lived and competent, they could bring  stability to a country.
They were trained from birth to rule. 
In George's case he had military and language knowledge
far exceeding the average person, and lifelong dedication.  
And he also was familially related to a vast number of
other European Royal families, a great advantage for diplomacy.
This was crucial since Greece was at the mercy of
the Great Powers and could not afford to misjudge them.
If Greece had indeed gotten their first choice Prince Alfred, all those advantages 
(except for language knowledge) would have been even greater.
</p><p>
Kings, of course, also had disadvantages &ndash;
especially bad ones with no qualifications besides genetics.
But Greece was in such a desperate situation in 1863 that they had to roll the dice and
hope for a good outcome.  And George I, being
intentionally chosen, 
i.e. not forced upon everyone solely due to his birth, thus plausibly
could hope actually to
be better than the average King.  So, while this was a roll of the dice for Greece, it
was a roll with better odds than usual.  And in my opinion, Greece lucked out.
George I worked out better for Greece that probably than most anyone
expected.  Things could easily have been a lot worse.
</p><p>
In particular, George proved to be a strong polyglot, toward the end of his life being 
comfortable in Danish, Greek, English, German, and French
(and with a Russian wife to help with Russian).  
He was a good diplomat with good insights into the foreign powers.
This undoubtably was aided by the fact 
his father Christian IX and mother
Louise turned out to be excellent procreators; Christian was dubbed the "father in law of Europe"
for his &amp; Louise's unmatched ability to produce descendants who'd end up in
the royal lines of important other countries.
</p>
<b>Family tree (highly abbreviated) of George I:</b>
<blockquote>
<b>Christian IX</b>, king of Denmark (life 1818-1906) married Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel (life 1817-1898).
They had 6 children. Descendants besides Greece's George I include 
Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (<i>and</i> her
husband Philip), King Philippe of Belgium, Kings Harald V and Haakon VII of Norway, 
King Felipe VI of Spain, Nicholas II of Russia, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, queen consort 
Anne of Romania, and Queen Sofia of Spain.
<br>
<b>George I</b> (life 1845-1913) married <b>Olga</b>, grand Duchess of Russia (life 1851-1926).
George I was 2nd son, and 3rd child, of Christian IX.
G.I became king 1863.  Reigned until assassination 1913.
G+O had 5 sons and 3 daughters, including...
<br>
<b>Constantine I</b> (life 1868-1923) married Sophie of Prussia (life 1870-1932).
C.I abdicated and departed Greece 1917, being replaced by his 2nd son
Alexander who reigned 1917 until his death in 1920; then was temporarily
replaced by Paul, third son of C.I+Sophie.
C+S had 3 sons and 3 daughters, including his first son...
<br>
<b>George II</b> (life 1890-1947) married Elisabeth of Roumania (life 1894-1956).
G+E had no children. They separated in 1932 and divorced in 1935.
G.II was "king in name only" says Kiste p143.
In 1924 the Vouli under A.Papanastiou declared Greece a republic
and the monarchy abolished.  G.II left the country.
But in 1946 a Greek plebiscite was held with 69% voting
for the return of G.II (who at that time was living in London)
with return to constitutional monarchy.  G.II indeed then returned, but died within a year.
<br>
G.I+Olga also had son <b>Andrew</b> (life 1882-1944) whose son <b>Philip</b> (1921-)
married <b>Queen Elizabeth II</b> of England in 1947, thus becoming "Duke of Edinburgh" and
"royal consort."
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Constitution.</b>
A Greek constitution then was written by a Greek assembly at George's urging
(this took about a year),
and duly signed into law by George in November 1864.
Unlike Otho, George actually supported the constitution throughout his life, even later revisions
diminishing his royal powers.  
In this stance George was surely influenced by the fact that in 1849, his own Denmark had
peacefully set up, with the cooperation of its then king Christian VIII,
a constitutional monarchy featuring civil rights guarantees, a bicameral house,
and universal male suffrage for electing the lower house, or "Folketing"
(albeit restricted suffrage for other house, the "Landsting").  
Christian VIII is not to be
confused with George's father who later, in Nov. 1863, was peacefully 
enthroned as Christian IX, king of Denmark,
after Frederick VII died childless.  
Christian IX was unrelated (or only very distantly) to Christian VIII.
It did not escape George's notice that Denmark did not 
implode after taking this remarkable step.  It seemed to do quite well.
<!--
The Constitution of 1864 was drafted following the models of the Constitutions of Belgium of 1831
and of Denmark of 1849. 
[BELGIUM:
In 1831: voting based on a tax payment making a man eligible to vote and effectively restricting 
power to the wealthy. 
Reform of 1893: Obligatory voting among males age&ge;25, but men could have more than one vote, namely up to
three votes, if they were more-wealthy or more-educated or had held certain offices]
[DENMARK:
1849: civil right guarantees, bicameral house, universal suffrage for Folketing, restricted for Landsting,]
-->
</p><p>
Greece's 1864 constitution
clearly stated the principle of the <i>people</i> as the ultimate source of power,
since the only legislative body
with reversionary powers was the unicameral Parliament, or "Vouli."
(The "Senate," viewed as a tool of the Monarch, was abolished.)
The Vouli consisted of
males aged&ge;30, serving terms of &le;4 years,
elected directly by the people, via approval voting with secret ballot, with universal
suffrage for males aged&ge;21.   It is arguable &ndash; and indeed the Greeks do argue &ndash;
that this made them 
<b>the <i>first</i> country in modern Europe to govern itself via universal suffrage.</b>
The Vouli's election via
<i>approval voting</i> also was a first, 
albeit their voting method does not seem to have been specified within the constitution itself.
</p><blockquote>

Apparently this English translation was made by
<a href="http://www.hoelseth.com/various/dag.html">Dag Trygsland Hoelseth</a>, a Norwegian historian.
The 1927 constitution officially ended the Greek approval voting era.
</blockquote><p>
But the King retained very considerable powers under the 1864 constitution, see 
<a href="index.html%3F%3F.html">below</a>.
</p><p>
The fact that George gave the crucial spark of life to the 1864 constitution, was
somewhat odd given that under its provisions
he was not yet old enough to vote.  But nobody remarked on that oddness besides me.
</p><p>
<b>Money.</b>
In recompense for his services the King was to receive 4000 pounds
annually from each of England, Russia and France
(this &pound;12K is equivalent to about $1 million in year-2015 dollars), 
plus 1125K drachmas
extracted from Greece on
day one to buy (I suppose) several palaces; plus 200K drachmas annually.
The drachma at that time was worth the same as a French franc, which both were worth 
about $13 in year-2015 dollars.  The &pound;4000
payments from the three Great Powers really came from Greece in the sense that the Powers
each "forgave" &pound;4000 worth of Greek debt repayments each year to finance it.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the constitution said the Vouli members
would get paid travel expenses plus were allowed to vote
themselves 1800 drachma per session, a session being part (3-6 months)
of a year. 
In 1898 the Vouli had 298 members but in 1906 only 177.
Thus the entire house combined earned somewhat fewer drachmas than 2
or 3 kings.  Nevertheless the Vouli members were paid very well in
comparison to the average person, see table.

<b>Population.</b>
Each Vouli member represented a district with about 10000
to 16000 population (depending on the year we are speaking of)
during this era.  The entire Greek population varied between 1.5 million in 1870 up to
2.7 million in 1913.
</p><p>
For his part, George promptly married mail-order bride
Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia 
in 1867, then age 16 (she also could not speak Greek &ndash; nor English, nor Danish &ndash; 
she and her husband communicated in German), and commenced
busily procreating (8 children, the first in 1868).  George and Olga did, to their credit, 
learn Greek, albeit always speaking it with an accent,
and George could be claimed to be ahead of his time 
for approving such an advanced constitution.
</p><p>
The Greek <b>approval-voting method</b> allowed even illiterate people to vote.
That was important 
<a href="http://find.galegroup.com/gic/infomark.do?&idigest=fb720fd31d9036c1ed2d1f3a0500fcc2&type=retrieve&tabID=T0012&prodId=GIC&docId=CX3460500254&source=gale&userGroupName=itsbtrial&version=1.0">since</a>
71% of Greek men were illiterate in 1870 (including,
initially, the King, unless you count foreign languages).
For each candidate there was an APPROVE urn and a DISAPPROVE urn, painted, respectively, 
white and black.
Each voter was given a marble, which he could place in one of those two urns
in a private manner (secret ballot).
</p><p>
(With standardized marbles this also would allow tallying the votes by weighing
the urns, although I do not know whether they did that.)
</p><p>
<b>How did the authors of the constitution think of this method???</b>
I do not know.  And actually I do not think it even was specified in the constitution <i>itself</i>.
But permit me to speculate.
They may have known about Ancient <a href="SpartaExec.html">Sparta</a>'s reliance on
continuum <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, and surely knew that the whole
idea of "democracy" often is claimed to have been invented in Ancient Athens.
(The Ancient Greeks also sometimes employed the idea of a <i>secret</i> ballot,
which also had been adopted in the French constitutions of 1795 and 1848.)
They also may have known about the 3-level range voting system 
(also employing marbles and urns)
that underlay renaissance <a href="VenHist.html">Venice</a>'s government.
Remember, Sparta was part of the glorious ancient Greek Age and the Spartan voting system
was discussed in the writings of, e.g, Aristotle.  And Venice had ruled a large chunk
of Greece, including most of the Adriatic coast,
about half the time during 1200-1715, plus ruled Crete throughout 1204-1669
and Cyprus 1489-1571.
</p><p>
<b>What was Greece like during the beginning of the approval voting era?</b>
It was a hellhole.  Poverty was rife and relieved only by mass emigration to the USA.
The economy was almost wholy agricultural and
almost all land was owned by rich landlords who rented it to poor landless peasants.
We already mentioned the massive illiteracy. 
When George I arrived from Denmark,
the country was already massively in debt; the army was disloyal;
there were no roads anywhere outside Athens; land transport was by mule on paths.
There were no railroads at all.
Bands of brigands roamed.
Society and government were tremendously corrupt, with "patron-client relationships"
permeating all levels of society.  
The government was bloated and wasteful, e.g.
in the 1870s the number of civil servants in Greece was 7&times;
the number (per capita) in Britain.
Open bribery and electoral fraud both were common.
</p><p>
<b>What were the political parties?</b>
The Encyclopedia Brittanica (1926 edition, although this part of their "Greece" article may have been
retained from some earlier edition?) says corruption was rife in the Vouli, and that the main
purpose of political parties in this era was "not for the furtherance
of any cause or principle, but [rather] with the object of obtaining
the spoils of office" and "even the strongest government is obliged to
bargain with its supporters in regard to the distribution of patronage
and other favors."
Initially after George I's enthronement, there were 3 main parties, colloquially called the
"English," "French," and "Russian" parties, but the importance of these did not last long.
</p><p>
<b>The King</b> had to appoint all public
officials, judges, and appointed and dismissed the ministers of the 7 departments (education,
justice, finance, worship, interior, army, navy).
He also could make treaties??
Declare wars??
George I's son, crown prince Constantine, served during George's later
years as commander in chief of the army.
The king also, during 1864-1875,
appointed all the Prime Ministers, apparently by choosing whichever 
Vouli member he liked the most.
The King also had the power to convene and dissolve parliament, 
albeit if he dissolved it then he had to call elections to reconvene it within 3 months.
Cabinet needed to approve??
The power to dissolve parliament, dismissing all vouli members,
was exercised by George I three times (1865, 1875, and 1892).
</p><p>
The 1926 Brittanica simply labels George I's handling of all that as
"personally irresponsible"??
</p>





Greek history was horrible and disgusting, and the whole country seems basically

argued that approval voting system did ultimately work to improve the situation

1910, who turned
them into an emerging Mediterranean  power by 1913 -- as opposed to a
bankrupt dysfunctional corrupt subservient client state under an
irresponsible playboy monarch -- and ultimately forced the end of the
monarchy,  The Greeks then changed their system starting in 1926 to a
PR system

I would like to (but haven't yet... more research must be done...
complicated story) make a web page about the Greek experience and what
we can learn from it.

But for now I point out this:
1. Approval voting during some parts of its era yielded multiparty
rule, other parts
2-party domination (reckoned by Greek history books as a 20-year
2-party domination sub-era), but that 2-party domination was
reversible and was reversed,
with the 1910 Liberal landslide coming from nowhere (in the sense
they'd never held any decent number of seats before).
  This contrasts with, say, the USA under plurality voting where
2-party domination has proved irreversible, and it is inconceivable
that a party could win a landslide from nowhere.



From 1864 to 1874, Greece had 21 governments, the longest of which lasted a year and a half.
In July 1874, Charilaos Trikoupis, a member of the Greek Parliament, wrote an anonymous article in the newspaper Kairoi blaming King George and his advisors for the continuing political crisis caused by the lack of stable governments. In the article, he accused the King of acting like an absolute monarch by imposing minority governments on the people. If the King insisted, he argued, that only a politician commanding a majority in the Vouli could be appointed prime minister, then politicians would be forced to work together more harmoniously in order to construct a coalition government. Such a plan, he wrote, would end the political instability and reduce the large number of smaller parties. Trikoupis admitted to writing the article after a man supposed by the authorities to be the author was arrested, whereupon he was taken into custody himself. After a public outcry, he was released and subsequently acquitted of the charge of "undermining the constitutional order". The following year, the King asked Trikoupis to form a government (without a majority) and then read a speech from the throne declaring that in future the leader of the majority party in parliament would be appointed prime minister

Greece in the last decades of the 19th century was increasingly prosperous and was developing a sense of its role on the European stage. In 1893, the Corinth Canal was built by a French company cutting the sea journey from the Adriatic Sea to Piraeus by 150 miles (241 km). 

King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete. Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, Eleftherios Venizelos, campaigned to have him removed.

The Greek Constitution of 1911 was a major step forward in the constitutional history of Greece. Following the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos after the Goudi revolt in 1909, Venizelos set about attempting to reform the state. The main outcome of this was a major revision to the Greek Constitution of 1864.

The most noteworthy amendments to the Constitution of 1864 concerning the protection of human rights, were the more effective protection of personal security, equality in tax burdens, of the right to assemble and of the inviolability of the domicile. Furthermore, the Constitution facilitated expropriation to allocate property to landless farmers, while simultaneously judicially protecting property rights.

Other important changes included the institution of an Electoral Court for the settlement of election disputes stemming from the parliamentary elections, the addition of new conflicts for MPs, the re-establishment of the State Council as the highest administrative court (which, however, was constituted and operated only under the Constitution of 1927), the improvement of the protection of judicial independence and the establishment of the non-removability of public employees. Finally, for the first time, the Constitution provided for mandatory and free education for all, and declared Katharevousa (i.e. archaising "purified" Greek) as the "official language of the Nation".

The Greek Constitution of 1844 defined Greece as a constitutional monarchy,[3] providing for a bicameral parliament, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The Greek Constitution of 1864 was somewhat more liberal, and transferred most of the real power to the parliament. In 1874 Charilaos Trikoupis published a manifesto entitled "Who's to blame?", naming King George I as the answer. Specifically, he condemned the king for bypassing parliamentary opinion in his selection of Prime Ministers. The article landed him briefly in jail, but also boosted his popularity significantly. A year later, on 8 May 1874 he mustered a parliamentary plurality and George reluctantly named him as Prime Minister. Thanks to Trikoupis' article, a new constitutional principle was recognized and implemented: the king was required to give the largest party in parliament first choice of forming a government. In 1911 Eleftherios Venizelos amended 54 of the 110 articles of the Constitution, trying to bring the constitution in line with his Liberal Party's principles. Nevertheless, the National schism of 1916 caused a huge constitutional crisis, as two governments were formed: one in Athens and one in Thessaloniki.

popular uprising and to the insurrection of the Athens Guard in September 1843. After the revolution the National Assembly voted for a new Constitution.

Constitutional Monarchy (1843 – 1862)

The Constitution of 1844 was not the result of a sovereign national assembly, yet the latter simply conceded to its composition. For this reason it was characterized as “Constitution – Contract” or “Constitution – Treaty”. It established the principle of the monarch’s sovereignty, as the monarch retained the decisive power and incarnated the State; the legislative power was to be exercised by the King - who also had the right to ratify laws –along with the Parliament, and the Senate.

The new Constitution also established the principle of the separation of powers. In addition, the monarch would appoint and dismiss ministers who assumed responsibility and were accountable for the King's actions. The Constitution made reference for the first time to fundamental individual rights such as the "secrecy of letters"
and the "inviolability of home."
Article 107 states that "Observance of the Constitution is entrusted to the patriotism of Greeks/"

Lastly the National Assembly adopted the electoral law of March 18, 1844, which was actually the first European law ever to make reference, in essence, to universal ballot.

The Constitution of 1844  established hereditary constitutional monarchy, recognized for the first time some fundamental individual rights (secrecy of letters, inviolability of home) and provided that the 
"Observance of the Constitution is entrusted to the patriotism of Greeks"
(the period of Constitutional Monarchy)

The Constitution of 1864 followed a popular revolt and restored the principle of popular sovereignty; it was governed by the democratic principle, being the first Constitution of Democracy with a King as head of the State. Additionally, it established for the first time in the world, the principle of universal (direct and secret) ballot (the relevant period)

The first period of Crowned Democracy (1864 – 1909)

A continuously changing social environment favoured a liberal and democratic consciousness in a way that King Otto’s absolutist tendencies could no longer be tolerated. In October 1862 a rising wave of discontent led the people and the military to rebel against King Otto and oust him along with the Wittelsbach dynasty. 

The revolt marked the end of constitutional monarchy and the beginning of a crowned democracy with George – Christian – Wilhelm of the Schleswig – Holstein –Sønderburg – Glücksburg dynasty as monarch. During the transition period (October 1862 – October 1863) the system of governance was that of a governing parliament which was in operation for the first and the last time in the constitutional history of the country.

The Constitution of 1864 was the product of the “2nd Athens National Assembly” that followed a popular revolt. The Constitution included 110 articles and was influenced by the Constitutions of Belgium (1831) and Denmark (1849). With the revisions of 1911 and 1952 this Constitution lasted more than a century. One of the most important elements of the new charter was the restoration of the principle of popular sovereignty, where the people and not the monarch were the source and the driving force of state power. In addition, it established the principles of direct, universal and secret ballot which would take place simultaneously in the entirety of the country. The Assembly opted for a single-chamber (unicameral) Parliament for a four-year term, and hence abolished the Senate. The new Constitution would also allow Parliament to establish "fact-finding, investigation committees". Moreover, the King preserved the right to convoke ordinary and extraordinary parliamentary sessions, and dissolve Parliament at his discretion, as long as, however, the Cabinet signed and endorsed the dissolution decree.

The democratic nature of the new political system was also affirmed by the Throne speech in August 11, 1875. The speech established, albeit informally the principle of the parliament’s «declared confidence» which attributed a different meaning to the entire system of the organization of political powers and legitimized fundamentally the introduction of the parliamentary system. According to the principle of «declared confidence» the King had the obligation to appoint the Government taking into consideration the will of the parliament’s majority. Therefore, the Constitutional provision according to which «the King appoints and removes ministers» was in practice confined, insofar as the Government ought to receive a vote of confidence by the parliament.

The second period of Crowned Democracy and the declaration of a Republic (1911 – 1924.)

The Constitution of 1864 did not change until 1911. However, the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were characterized by significant sociopolitical changes. The rise of the middle class, a shift in the role of the military, the gradual disappearance or the weakening of old political parties and practices, the new economic conditions, all exercised strong pressure on an obsolete political structure that had been put in place based on a different set of criteria. From a political, administrative, and social point of view those were the reasons of the "military coup" of Goudi (1909).

After that rebellion, Eleftherios Venizelos, leader of the Liberal Party became prime minister and proceeded with having the old Constitution of 1864 revised by the Second Revisionary Parliament. The pivotal points of the 1911 Constitutional reform were the enhanced protection of human rights (leading to the promulgation of "the public law of the Hellenes", which was the wording used at the time), the reinforcement of the Rule of Law and institutional modernization.

With regard to the protection of individual rights the most noteworthy amendments to the Constitution of 1864 were a more effective protection of individual security, equality in taxation, the right to assemble and the inviolability of the domicile. Furthermore, the Constitution facilitated expropriation so as for land to be allocated to poor farmers, while at the same time guaranteeing judicial protection of property rights. Other important changes included the establishment of an Electoral Tribunal with a view to settling election disputes that ensued after general elections, the addition of new reasons and capacities for MP incompatibilities, the re-establishment of the Supreme Administrative Court as the highest administrative court, improved protection of judicial independence, job permanence for public servants and a mandatory military service. Finally, it was the first time that the Constitution made provision for mandatory and free education for all, while the process of Constitutional revision was simplified.

Nonetheless the revolution of September 1922 resulted in the establishment of a Republic and the abolition of the Crown. The revolution was the outcome of a variety of domestic and international reasons such as the continuous conflicts of the political leadership with the palace, the catastrophic events in Asia Minor and the transformation of the geo-political situation in South East Europe. With the decisive contribution of Alexandros Papanastasiou the “4th Athens Constituent Assembly” abolished, in March 25 1922 the monarchy and established a Republic Democracy.

The Constitution of 1927

Whilst the Fourth Constituent Assembly was working towards a new Constitution, on the 25th of June 1925 there was a coup by General Th. Pangalos, followed by a second one by Kondylis in 1926. After the fall of the dictatorship the "Parliament of the First Term" was elected, and eventually, adopted the Constitution of 1927.

http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagmatiki-Istoria/

The most important changes made by the Revision of 1911, after the rise of Eleftherios Venizelos to the power, were the enhancement of individual freedoms ("the public law of the Hellenes") and of the Rule of Law, and the institutional modernization

Whilst the Fourth Constitutional Assembly was working towards the completion of the new Constitution, the coup d'etat of General Th. Pangalos took place. After the fall of his dictatorship in 1926, the "Parliament of the First Term" was elected, which, finally, voted through the Constitution of 1927.
This Constitution was particularly interesting both for its provisions on social rights and for the new political institutions it introduced in its organizational section. The most significant characteristic of the new Constitution of Greece was that it provided for an elected head of state, chosen by the Parliament and the Senate for a five-year term. The President of the Republic was politically unaccountable, he did not possess legislative authority and he could dissolve the Parliament with the approval of the Senate.

The Greek Constitution of 1844 defined Greece as a constitutional monarchy,[3] providing for a bicameral parliament, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The Greek Constitution of 1864 was somewhat more liberal, and transferred most of the real power to the parliament. In 1874 Charilaos Trikoupis published a manifesto entitled "Who's to blame?", naming King George I as the answer.

<p>
<b>Infrastructure improvements:</b>
During 1857-1869 the "Athens &amp; Piraeus Railway" was built,
the first in the land
(parts of it also became the second-oldest underground metro system in the world, after London).
In 1881, Trikoupis embarked on a government
project to build a network of about 500km of rail, 
ultimately completed 25 years later (20 years slower than planned).
By 1909 there were 1606km.
</p><p>
The canal cutting through Greece at Corinth (6.4 km long)
at sea level was a great engineering feat
begun in 1882 and
completed in 1893.  (Strangely enough it no longer has much commercial
importance as of year 2016, despite shortcutting what otherwise would be
a 700km journey, because it is
too narrow for most modern ships forcing them to traverse it in only one direction.)
