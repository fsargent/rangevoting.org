  Once the total number of valid ballots is established in 
  each multi-member district, the minimum number of votes 
  required for a candidate to be elected is calculated using 
  the Droop quota formula.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  quota formula is: 
  </font></p>
<center>
quota =
(total number of valid ballots cast in that district) / (1+number of seats) + 1
</center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. 
  All ballots are counted and each ballot is allocated as 
  a vote to the candidate against whose name a first preference 
  (i.e, &quot;1&quot;) is shown on the ballot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. 
  If a candidate(s) on the first count has a number of first 
  preference votes exactly equal to the minimum number of 
  votes needed to be elected, then that candidate(s) is declared 
  elected and the counted ballot papers indicating that candidate(s) 
  as a first preference are put aside and the other preferences 
  recorded on the ballots are not examined.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. 
  If a candidate on the first count gains <i>more</i> than the minimum 
  number of votes needed to be elected, the candidate is declared 
  elected, and the number of votes in excess of the number 
  of votes needed to be elected (the surplus) is recorded. 
  All of the elected candidate's ballots are then re-examined 
  and assigned to candidates not yet elected according to 
  the second preferences marked on the ballots of those who 
  gave a first preference vote to the elected candidate. These 
  votes are allocated according to a &quot;transfer value.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  formula for the transfer value is:</font></p>
<center>
(surplus votes cast for elected candidate) / (total number of votes received by elected candidate)
</center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. 
  If two or more candidates on the first count gain more than 
  the minimum number of votes needed to be elected, all of 
  those candidates are declared elected. The ballots of the 
  candidate with the largest number of first preference votes 
  will be re-examined first and assigned (at the transfer 
  value) to candidates not yet elected according to the second 
  preferences marked on that candidate's ballots, or the next 
  available preference, if the second preference candidate 
  has already been elected. The ballots of the other elected 
  candidate(s) will then be re-examined and their surpluses 
  distributed in order according to the number of first preference 
  votes each candidate received.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. 
  If a candidate reaches more than the minimum number of votes 
  needed to be elected as the consequence of a transfer of 
  votes from an elected candidate, the number of votes in 
  excess of the number of votes needed to be elected (the 
  surplus) will be transferred to other candidates. This transfer 
  will be to the next available preference shown on all of 
  this candidate's ballots. These ballots now include 1) the 
  candidate's first preference ballots, and 2) the parcel(s) 
  of ballots transferred to the candidate from one or more 
  elected candidates.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  transfer value for the candidate's first preference ballots 
  is:</font></p>
<center>
(surplus votes cast for the elected candidate) / 
(total number of votes received by the elected candidate)
</center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  transfer value for each parcel of ballots transferred to 
  the candidate from one or more elected candidates is:</font></p>
<center>
(transfer value of parcel of ballots received by the candidate) &times;
(surplus votes cast for the candidate) / 
(total number of votes received by the candidate)
</center>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. 
  If no candidate has a number of votes equal to or greater 
  than the minimum number of votes needed to be elected, the 
  candidate with the smallest number of votes is excluded. 
  All of that candidate's ballots-both first preference ballots 
  and any parcel or parcels of ballots transferred from other 
  candidates-are transferred to candidates who have not been 
  elected or excluded according to the next available preference 
  shown on the excluded candidate's ballots.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  excluded candidate's first preference ballots are transferred 
  to the second (or next available) preferences at full value. 
  Ballots received from previously-elected (or excluded) candidates 
  are transferred at the transfer value at which the ballots 
  were received.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. 
  Counting continues in the described sequence: the surplus 
  of elected candidates is assigned until no more candidates 
  are elected, then the ballots of excluded candidates are 
  assigned until another candidate is elected.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
  all but one of the candidates to be elected from the district 
  have been elected, and only two candidates remain in the 
  count, the candidate with the most votes is declared elected, 
  even though the candidate may not have reached the minimum 
  number of votes (the quota) needed to be elected.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. 
  If, during the transfer of preferences, a ballot paper does 
  not indicate an available preference, the ballot is put 
  aside as &quot;exhausted.&quot; This can occur because:<br>
  o the voter only indicated one, or a small number of preferences;<br>
  o all the preferred candidates have already been elected 
  or excluded; or<br>
  o there are gaps or repetitions on the ballot in the sequence 
  of numbering preferences.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Provisions 
  for tied votes</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. 
  Where two or more candidates have the same number of first 
  preference votes at the end of the first count, and this 
  number is more than the minimum number of votes necessary 
  for election, then the candidate whose surplus is distributed 
  first will be decided by lot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11. 
  Where no candidate has a number of first preference votes 
  equal to or greater than the number of votes necessary for 
  election at the end of the first count, and two or more 
  candidates have the same number of first preference votes, 
  this number being the smallest number of first preference 
  votes gained by any candidate, then the candidate who is 
  excluded first will be decided by lot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12. 
  If, at any stage of the count other than during the first 
  count, two candidates have the same number of votes, the 
  candidate who is declared elected first, or who is not excluded 
  will be:<br>
  a. the candidate with the larger number of votes in the 
  previous or immediately next preceding count where there 
  is a difference in the votes between the two candidates; 
  or<br>
  b. the candidate whose name is drawn by lot, where there 
  is no difference in the number of votes between the candidates 
  at any preceding count.</font><br>
