<H2> How to get Range (or Approval) Voting adopted in the real world &ndash; I. The USA </H2>

<p>
(<a href="#conclusions">Skip to conclusions</a>)
(<a href="StratSumm.html">Executive Summary</a>)
</p>
<p>
Let me focus my discussion on the USA (which is where I live).
</p>

<p>
There are several possible approaches:
<ol>
<li> US constitutional amendment or law to adopt range voting nationwide.
</li><li>
State laws or state constitutional amendments  to adopt range voting statewide.
</li><li>
Ditto, but in some very large city such as New York City.
</li><li>
Smaller city such as Worchester MA.
</li><li>
Party primary contests either statewide or citywide.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of these alternatives, #1 seems out of reach and history suggests
will remain out of reach until a large number of states have already adopted 
improved voting systems (that is what happened with allowing women to vote and with
direct senatorial election in the US &ndash; the states moved first and only later
did a US-wide constitutional amendment occur).
I can only think of one way #1 could get moving &ndash; if one of us successfully runs
for US president.  A likely story.
</p>

<p>
#4 seems a waste of time: Cambridge MA has used STV voting for years and nobody noticed.
There is no point to doing something nobody notices.  Even NY City may be too
small to have an impact (did you know NY City once employed a different voting system?  
Anybody know what and when? ...I thought not.)
</p>

<p>
So we must focus on #3 and primarily #2.  (However we shall see
the obstacles to #2 are large
and will be reduced if #5 is done first.)
</p>

<p>
#2 has been tried before and reached the floor of some state legislatures,
with, e.g. Steve Brams testifying before the NH state legislature.  All
such attempts have failed.  I suggest to you that no legislature will willingly change the system
that got them elected.  That is why countless election reform attempts worldwide have failed.
Britain's ERS has tried for over 100 years without success in Britain and they are
a hell of a lot better organized and bigger than us, and operating in a smaller country.
</p>

<p>
That suggests the legislature probably has to be bypassed 
and we need to go directly to the people.
<p>

<p>
The following US states allow statutes to be passed by "initiative":
<center>
 AZ, AR, CA, CO, ID, MO, MT, NE, ND, OK, OR, SD, UT, WA.
</center>
The following US states allow constitutional amendments to be passed by "initiative":
<center>
 AZ, AR, CA, CO, FL, IL, MI, MO, MT, NE, NV, ND, OH, OK, OR, SD.
</center>

<p>
The usual procedure to run a voter initiative is:
you formulate the wording very carefully of your
initiative, then you collect signatures to get it put on the ballot.
(See  <a href="BallInit.html">ballotprop</a>  for possible model wording.)

<p>
Maybe 50,000 signatures need to be collected (amounts may vary in your state; look it up).
It is possible to collect about 100 signatures per day in malls, subway stations, etc.
</p>

<p>
As you can imagine (do the math) it will take a lot of <i>volunteers</i>, time, and money to
collect enough signatures.  To get the money we need somebody rich, or a grant from the likes
of, e.g. George Soros, Ross Perot, Rockefeller Foundation, etc.
</p>

<p>
Enough volunteers are theoretically already available inside the Green party, 
Libertarian party, Constitution Party, etc.  However, that requires the leadership
in those parties to get enough of a damn clue to realize that 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
 without a new voting system, they are going nowhere.
</li><li>
 so their <i>top</i> priority must be to reform the voting system.
</li><li>
 IRV voting is just going to <a href="TarrIrv.html">continue</a>
 to cause 2-party domination (see my 
        <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper #76</a>;
     indeed some modern discussions of <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's law</a> 
     [the label given to
     self-reinforcing 2-party domination caused by the wrong kinds of voting systems]
     simply lump together IRV and plurality countries without comment, since they noticed
     the IRV countries Australia & Ireland are 2-party dominated.)
</li><li>
 Range voting is going to help 3rd parties the most &ndash; much more than approval voting.
       (See <a href="PsEl04.html">results</a> of real-world 
         <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">study #82</a>.)
</li><li>
 Therefore 3rd parties are idiots to
       push IRV and it is  not as smart to push approval as to push range voting.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So far, I have seen no sign that third-party leaders recognize these facts,
and all US 3rd parties seem to have a great interest in suicide.
With enough money to run an advertising campaign it might be possible to change
that.  You could also try telling and talking and writing to party leaders.
I have tried that with the Green party and it didn't work; but we did have
some success with the Libertarian and Socialist-USA parties, both of whose
2004 presidential candidates now have endorsed CRV.
Perhaps I am not persuasive since e.g. I do not
have lots of money, am not well known to them etc.  If it were George Soros 
talking, they'd listen.
</p>

A better web site would help.  I am trying to write a book but its 
publication prospects currently not looking good...

<p>
Now, assuming we succeed in getting range voting on a state ballot initiative, then 
the initiative will fail.  Polls conducted by me, Greene, and Quintal
(<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper  #82</a>) 
have shown that US voters,
given a minute or so to think about it, prefer to <i>keep</i> plurality voting and
<i>not</i> to switch to either approval voting or range voting.   There are some
indications (but the statistics are not convincing of this)  that they prefer
approval over range, but it is definitely clear they prefer plurality over either.
</p>
<p>
That means that just getting an initiative on the ballot will not be good enough.
There also has to be a simultaneous massive media and PR campaign to educate the public on this.
That requires very big bucks, we are talking 1 million dollars and maybe more per
state targeted,  and some intelligence about how to spend it.
(And just the fact something is on the ballot does not imply it will get media attention.  Tons
of state ballot issues get almost zero media attention.)
</p>
<p>
If and when a lot of states adopt range voting, then the stage will be set for a nationwide
attempt.  This will all take about 10-20 years at a minimum.
</p>
<p>
Now since I imagine probably we are not going to be rolling in $millions soon,
nice try but... the above approach probably is <i>still</i> not good enough, i.e. doomed to fail.  
Therefore we need to find a way
to get <i>free</i> massive publicity and education.
After everybody has been exposed to that, <i>then</i> we are in a better position to
fire up the above strategy of ballot initiatives with 3rd party volunteers.
</p>
<p>
That is where Paul Kislanko's idea comes in.  He writes:
"I personally am not sold on AV [RV] for general elections. But I think it is
absolutely perfect for party primary elections."  Note: range voting's
comparative advantages are greatest when the number of candidates are large,
which often happens in primaries, and where there are no clear "frontrunners" &ndash;
which also often happens.
</p>
<P>
"And that doesn't require constitutional amendments or anything else -
parties get to choose whether to even hold a vote, witness the "caucus"
states. Where the states pay for the primary elections, a party choosing to
use approval might have to subsidize the non-plurality collection/counting
process, but getting an advocate in front of a state party commission is a
lot easier than getting elected president."
</p>
<p>
This thinking suggests we want to find a magical place where 
<ol>
<li>
primaries get a lot of media attention.  Really a lot.
</li><li>
the parties conduct them without using state machinery in ways not
set by state law but rather by their own party internal rules.
</li><li>
the inhabitants and parties are already pretty well aware of
the shortcomings of the plurality system in their primaries so they'd be happy
to improve it.
</li><li>
the 2 parties themselves realize that those particular primaries, by choosing
poorer quality candidates that they could have done via range voting, are <i>seriously</i>
hurting them, and hurting their whole party <i>nationwide</i> (not just in the location of
that primary) due to some amazing amplification effect specially magically concentrated at that 
one place. So: <i>they themselves greatly want</i> to reform the system 
(as opposed to their usual  obstructionism) because
doing so is strongly in their <i>self-interest</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But what is this magical place?
</p>
<p>
Two words:  "Iowa Primary Caucuses."
</p>

<a name="conclusions">
<H3> Conclusions </H3>
We need to make these moves in this approximate order:
<ol>
<li>
 Convince 3rd parties range voting is the only way to save their skins.
</li><li>
 Get working web site.   Get bulletin board with 1000s of members.
</li><li>
 Publish book?
</li><li>
 Get $ grants.
</li><li>
 Get RV adopted in Democratic &amp; Republican party primaries, especially Iowa caucuses.
</li><li>
 State ballot initiatives for RV.  Petition drive to get it on ballot.  At same time:
</li><li>
 Massive PR+media campaign in target state requiring big bucks.
</li><li>
(capacity to keep trying 5-7 again after failure.)
</li><li>
If we ever get enough states to adopt range voting, then third parties
will at last be able to get a foothold &ndash; within those states.  It will still
be a very weak foothold.   Then at last we can try a nationwide campaign for RV.
That will be very hard because the Dems and Repubs probably then will both oppose it.
But even if it fails, accomplishing putting RV into #5 and #6
still will be a very big worthwhile accomplishment.
</li>
</ol>
