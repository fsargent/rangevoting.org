<H2> "Properties" of election systems &ndash; not a very good yardstick for comparing them </H2>

<p>
As either an election system design  tool, or as a method
of discriminating better from worse election systems,
one can try demanding an election system have certain logical <i>properties</i>
(or determining which properties various systems obey or disobey).
</p>

<p>
In my opinion the property-based approach 
for discriminating among single-winner election systems,
was largely a <i>wrong approach</i> which is now largely <i>obsolete</i>,
which led the whole political science community down the <i>wrong path</i>
for decades.  That is because it is not clear which properties are more 
important than others.  So while understanding the properties of a voting system is
good because it gives us more understanding, it is insufficient to
make it clear that election system  A  is better than election system  B. 
And indeed such results as "Arrow's impossibility theorem"
(showing that no voting system with a certain combination of properties could exist)
erroneously led political scientists to the wrong idea that there could <i>not be</i>
any "best" single-winner voting system.   
And then everyone was reduced to eternal arguments of the form
"my system satisfies the Transvestite Inversion Property and yours doesn't, so mine is better,"
versus "Oh yeah?  But <i>my</i> system satisfies Super-Monotonic Angst and I
consider that more important" versus "Well I don't!" etc etc.
Not very productive.
</p>

<H3> Bayesian regret is a better yardstick </H3>

<p>
The <i>right path</i>
is ``<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>''
measurement.
Although it is not directly defined this way, Bayesian regret
in a sense automatically considers <i>all</i> possible
"properties" or "paradox" (property failure) scenarios &ndash; whether or not
any human has ever considered or named that 
property before &ndash; and automatically weights
them all with the correct weights that depend both on the likelihood
of that kind of paradox and on its severity (utility-decreasing effect for society).
</p>

<p>
Bayesian regret measurement can be automated.
Several people (including me, although I came later than most) independently
invented Bayesian regret and realized it could be used for automated
election system comparison.  But I did the most extensive such
automated comparative study and mine was the only study that included "range voting."
Therefore it was I who made the extremely important discovery of the 
<a href="UniqBest.html">clear superiority</a> 
of range voting over all other voting systems in that study.
This reversed decades of wrong views that no voting system was clearly "best."
</p>

<p>
(However, for <a href="AdvocatedSystems.html#multi"><i>multi</i>winner</a>
elections, nobody has proposed
any concept like Bayesian regret,
and hence we do not know a way to make a clear, automated comparison between different
election systems.  Therefore, we are forced back to the old-style property-based
approach.)
