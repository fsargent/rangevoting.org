<H2> Marcus Pivato's characterization of range voting </H2>

<p>
<b>THEOREM claimed by Professor Marcus Pivato (2011):</b>
 Given a finite set of candidates.  Range Voting is the (1) "most expressive" 
voting rule which satisfies (2) "reinforcement," (3) "neutrality," (4) 
"overwhelming majority," 
and (5) "does <i>not</i> admit minority overrides." 
</p><p>
What do all those numbered quoted terms mean? To define them (in reverse order):
</p><p>
(5) "Admits minority overrides" means a single voter can always change 
the election outcome.
</p><p>
(4) "Overwhelming majority" means that if you take some subset S of the voters V 
and make M copies of S, then for all sufficiently large M, i.e. in the 
limit M&rarr;&infin;, 
the winner of the full set of voters with all those copies added will always be 
the same as the winner using just the voters in S alone &ndash; except that 
the voters in V-S 
can play the role of breaking ties among the S-only winners. 
</p><p>
(3) "Neutrality" means all candidates are treated equally (permutation 
equivariance, i.e. 
renaming the candidates has no effect on the winners other than the 
obvious renaming).
</p><p>
(2) "Reinforcement" means if set A of voters would yield some election result, 
and disjoint set B of voters would yield the same election result, then the 
union-set A&cup;B should too. 
</p><p>
(1) "Expressiveness" comparison is done via subset.  That is, voting method J 
is "at least as expressive" as voting method K if the possible votes 
with J form a superset 
of the votes with K and the election results using the two methods are 
the same provided 
we stay within the common subset.
