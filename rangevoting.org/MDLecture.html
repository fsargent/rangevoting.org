<p><b>Abstract.</b>
<br>
1. We argue "range voting" is the best single-winner voting method
among all commonly proposed alternatives.  Measurements &amp; estimates 
<a href="LivesSaved.html">indicate</a>
that if adopted instead of the currently most-used system, "plurality voting,"
humanity's lot would improve by an amount comparable to or exceeding the
improvement got from switching from undemocratic forms of government to
democracy.   Conservative estimate:
each day's delay in getting range voting
costs 5000 lives.
</p><p>
2. We argue (by analysing an explicit political <a href="StratSumm.html">strategy</a>
to get it)
range voting is, in fact, an obtainable dream.
</p><p>
3. We shall also discuss some other mathematical ideas for improving democracy such
as the "shortest splitline" gerrymandering-abolition 
<a href="GerryExamples.html">plan</a>, and a <i>low-tech</i>
plan by Ronald Rivest
(as repaired by me) for fraud-proof secret ballot voting.

<H2> World situation: crises approaching.  Need good decision-making. </H2>

<p>
Major incoming crises:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://hubbert.mines.edu/">End</a> of cheap oil, 
</li><li>
Global fisheries <a href="Fisheries.html">species collapse</a>,
</li><li>
Exhaustion of important fossil water reserves, 
</li><li>
<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf">Climate change</a>,
</li><li>
Overpopulation, 
</li><li>
Nuclear and bioweapon proliferation.
</li></ol>

<p>
Important that world make the right decisions. 
But what is world's decision-making algorithm?
</p>

<p>
US now sole superpower &rArr;
closest simple approximation to the answer = USA's 
appalling voting system.  Features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Voters can easily elect the candidate 
they <a href="LoseAll.html">least</a> want (even just among the Two)
thanks to "spoiler" and "cloning" pathologies.
</li>
<li>Rampant <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a> seemingly worse than most democracies; </li>
<li>An elected partisan official in charge of supervising elections in 33 out of 50 states 
(and in other states  appointed by the governor &ndash; maybe even worse); </li>
<li>98% year-ahead <a href="NonVoters.html">predictability</a> of all important races 
(largest among democratic nations) 
and <i>uncontested</i> state house races about a third of the time; </li>
<li>Massive two-party <a href="Strangle.html">domination</a> (over 99.5%)
causing opposing views to be almost completely blocked out of both power and the media; </li>
<li>Electoral college  inspires candidates to cater only to "swing states," ignore rest; </li>
<li>Highly restrictive ballot-access <a href="BallAccess.html">laws</a> in many states designed to ensure two-party (or one-party) domination not just in <i>office</i> but also on the <i>ballot</i>. 
(Lieberman's run would have been illegal in 46/50 states.) </li>

An 11-voter, 6-candidate election (candidates A,B,C,D,E,F)
</caption>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
<b>Plurality:</b> A wins (most top-rank votes with 4).
<br>
<b>Plurality+Runoff among top two:</b> B wins over A in the runoff, 6-to-5.
<br>
<b>Instant Runoff (IRV):</b> C wins
(eliminate E, D, F, and B in that order &ndash;  doesn't matter which way you break 
DF tie &ndash; then C beats A in final round 7 to 4).
IRV repeatedly deletes the candidate with fewest
top-rank votes, then the remaining one wins.

<!-- Note, when F is eliminated, there
is a tie between F and C which we assume is broken in favor of C because
all the F-voters have C as their second choice at that point, whereas the C-voters
rank F near last place.  (If 
you are morally opposed to this tie-breaking gimmick, then a 19-voter solution with
7,5,4,2,1 in the #voters column does the job.) -->
<br>
<b>Borda:</b> D wins.   
(D's Borda score is 16+9+4+5+2=36 versus E with 12+12+6+1+3=34 and 
with lower scores for A, B, C, and F.)  In the Borda system a candidate gets awarded
0 points if ranked last, 1 if ranked second-last, 2 if...  and the candidate
with the greatest score-sum ("Borda count") wins.
<br>
<b>Condorcet:</b> E wins.  (Since E pairwise-beats each other candidate, e.g. beating
A 6:5, B 6:5, C 7:4, D 6:5, and F 9:2.)
<br>
<b><a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval</a> Voting:</b> 
If all the <font color="red">red</font> candidates are "approved," then F wins with
7 approvals (versus A=4, B=5, C=3, D=6, E=5).
</p>

<p>
And with 0-99 <b>Range Voting</b>, 
it would in fact be possible to make <i>any</i> of the 6 
candidates win,
depending on how the voters chose the scores compatibly with the orderings above.
In Range Voting each voter awards a score from 0 to 99 to each candidate;
greatest average score wins.
(<a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.org">Fancier rules</a> allow also scoring a candidate with 
X = intentional blank = "no opinion" &ndash; only numerical scores incorporated 
into averages.)

<H2>  Arrow impossibility theorem &amp; Nobel causes 50 year timewaste </H2>

<p>
K.J.Arrow's (1950) theorem states that no voting method
can satisfy following short list of conditions:
<ol>
<li>

Is no dictator.</li>
<li>
If every voter prefers A to B then so does group.</li>
<li>
Relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their
relative positions in the individual rankings, but do <I>not</i> depend on the
individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C.</li>
</ol>
"This discovery was a major factor in Arrow winning the Nobel Prize in Economics."
</p>

<p>
Commonly heard: "Arrow's theorem shows that no 'best' voting system exists."
<br>
"Proof":
By Arrow, for every voting system, including the putative "best" system B,
exists an election which makes it look bad.  Construct system A which looks good in that situation.
Then A is "superior" to B so B cannot be best. Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<b>That all is wrong.</b>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> satisfies all three
criteria, accomplishing the "impossible"!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Huh?
</li><li>
Arrow's definition of "voting system" excludes range voting.
</li><li>
Oh.
</li><li>
True lesson of Arrow's theorem = stay away from voting systems based 
on rank-order ballots. 
</li><li>
(Reinforcement:
I have a <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper</a>
in which I construct "universal counterexamples"
which make <i>every</i> voting method based on <i>finite</i> set of
vote-types look bad [min-utility winners]
while range voting [continuum infinity of vote-types] looks
good [max-utility winner].)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bogusness.  "Property based" thinking 
misled all of political science for 50 years.
</p>

<hr>

<H2>  Three ways to (try to) seek a best voting system </H2>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>1. Look at human elections through <a href="FunnyElections.html">history</a>, 
or artificial ones (paid subjects).</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real; right sample space.
<br>
Cons[Historical]: Often hard to assess 
how "good" different election results were or would have been
and what results "would" have occurred 
had other election method X had been used instead.  
(And subjective. And you'll be accused of bias.)
Also, still not really correct sample 
space (since space might <a href="Duverger.html">change</a> over time with new X...).
<br>
Cons[Paid subjects]: 
Very expensive.  Not really real.   
<br>
Cons[Both]: Little data &rArr; low statistical significance &rArr; few results.  
And people lie to pollsters.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>2. Find planet; create eusocial lifeform that needs to conduct elections
as important part of life-cycle; better decisions via the elections &rArr; more fitness;
put on planet; wait 20-200 million years; see
what voting system Darwinian evolution comes up with.</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real (arguably more real than with humans).   Lots of data &rArr; high significance.
<br>
Cons: Spare planets unavailable in local drug store.
<br>
Pros: Already been done at least twice on this planet (social insects)!! <i>Hundreds of
trillions</i> of very-important-to-the-insects elections so far! <i>All</i> voting systems
considered (in some sense).
</dd>
<dt>
<b>3. Measure "Bayesian regret" of different election methods via computer election sims.
</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Large amounts of data &rArr; statistical significance is no problem.
Artificial cyber-voters better than humans: 
Can read their  "minds" to
find their true desires unpolluted by lies 
(measured in standard "happiness units" too).
<br>
Cons: Computer results out = only as good as the assumptions &amp; models in.
Only try voting systems you try, not all possible.
<br>
Pros: 
Can try large number of assumption sets &amp; models.  If so lucky that
in <i>all</i> of them, one voting method robustly is best, convincing.
<br>
Con: If not so lucky &ndash; some methods best in this model, others best in that &rArr;
bummer.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<H2>  What is Bayesian Regret? </H2>

<p>
<b>Oversimplified into nutshell:</b>
"Bayesian regret" of election method E is 
"expected avoidable human unhappiness"
caused by using E.
</p>

<p>
<b>More precise answer:</b>
Bayesian regret is gotten via this <i>procedure</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter has a personal
"utility" value for the election of each candidate.
(E.g., if Nixon is elected, then Jill Voter acquires -55 extra lifetime happiness units.)
In computer simulation,  "voters" &amp; "candidates" are artificial,
and the utility numbers are generated by 
some randomized "utility generator" and assigned
artificially to each candidate-voter pair.
</li>
<li>
Now the voters vote, based both on their private utility
values, and (if strategic voters)
on their perception from "pre-election polls"
(also generated artificially within the simulation, e.g. from
a random subsample of "people") of how
the other voters are going to act.
<br><font size="-1">(Note.  Some people here have gotten the wrong impression
that this is assuming that voters will be "honest" or that we are
assuming that honest range voters
will use candidate-utilities as their candidate-scores.  Neither impression is correct:
These assumptions are not made.)</font>
</li>
<li>
Election system E elects some winning candidate W.
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for W, is
the "<font color="blue">achieved societal utility</font>."
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for X,
<i>maximized</i> over all candidates X, is
the "<font color="blue">optimum societal utility</font>" which would have been
achieved if the election system had magically chosen the 
societally best candidate.
</li>
<li>
The <font color="blue">difference</font>
between 5 and 4 is the "<font color="blue">Bayesian Regret</font>"
of the election system E, at least in this experiment.
It might be zero, but if E was bad or if this election was unlucky for E, then
it will be positive because W and X will be different candidates.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Redo steps 1-6 zillion times
(i.e. do zillion simulated elections) to find 
<i>average Bayesian regret</i> of election system E.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
The Bayesian regret of an election system E may differ if we
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vary the number of voters, 
</li>
<li>
Vary the number of candidates, 
</li>

<li>
Vary the kind of "utility generator" (e.g. could be based on different numbers of "issues"
with different methods for generating the locations of the candidates in "issue space"),
</li>
<li>
Use different kinds of assumed "voter strategy", or 
</li>
<li>
Put different amounts of "voter ignorance". (*)
</li>
</ol>
(*) Can put in
voter ignorance by artificially adding random noise to 
voter's private utility values, and then make voters act
based on <i>distorted</i> values.  Higher amplitude
noise &rArr; more ignorance.
</p>

<p>

&exist; at least 5 different "knobs" to "turn" on our 
machine for measuring Bayesian Regret of elctn method E.
</p>


<hr>

<H2> Results of 1999 computer simulation 
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">study</a>:</H2>

<p>
Measured Bayesian regrets for about 30 different election methods.
720  different "knob setting"  combinations  tried.
Amazing result: in <i>all</i> 720 scenarios, range voting
was best (had lowest Bayesian regret, up to statistically insignificant
noise).  We repeat: RV best in <i>every single one</i>
of those 720 with either honest <i>or</i>
strategic
voters, regardless of ignorance-level, #candidates (3-5), 
#voters (5-200), #issues (0-&infin;)
etc.

has no clear answer &ndash; some better in some kinds

<H2> How much does RV matter to humanity? </H2>

<p>
<b>1. RV=comparable improvement over democracy as <i>invention</i> of democracy.</b>
Both transitions
non-democracy(modeled by "random winner" or better) &rarr;
democracy(strategic plurality voting) &rarr; 
Range Voting (halfway between honest &amp; strategic BR numbers)
<i>comparable</i> in terms of BR reduction; if anything second looks <i>larger</i>.
</p>

<p><b>2. Democide:</b>
<blockquote>
During this [the 20th] century's wars, there were some 38 million battle deaths,
but almost four times more people &ndash; at least 170 million &ndash;
were killed by governments for ethnic, racial, tribal,
religious, or political reasons. I call this phenomenon
<i>democide</i>, and it means that authoritarian and totalitarian
governments are more deadly than war.<br>
&ndash;R.J.Rummel (prof. Emeritus, U.Hawaii),
in his book <i>Death by Government</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rummel on his <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE5.HTM">democide statistics website<a/>
gives corrections now finding the democide body count during 1900-1999 to be
262,000,000, which is <i>six</i> times the war dead and equiv. to 7200 killed per day.
</p>

<p><b>3. Government waste:</b>
Economist Martin Bailey estimates US Govt spending is 50% waste (e.g. same power military could
be got with half the money, etc.); detailed tabulation in his <a href="RVPapers.html">book</a>.
That 50% is $1.1 Trillion/year, which is equivalent to 4.4 million lives per year,
i.e. 12050 lives/day.
(At rate of 1 life=$250,000 earned per world-average life).
</p>

<p><b>4. Life expectancy &amp; GNP/capita:</b>
Are significantly higher (on average) in democracies.
(E.g: [a] Life expectancy in E.Germany jumped 6 years since reunification;
[b] <!-- Taiwan 76.6 vs China 70.5 also 6 years; -->
Taiwan 77.4 vs China 71 also 6 years;
[c] Compare North with South Korea;
[d] check Vanhanen's &amp; Barro's large cross-country datasets and fits.)
This leads to numbers &asymp;30,000 lives/day or more.
</p>

<p><b>5. Saving world via better decisions:</b>
Suppose USA, by adopting range voting, lowers risk of 2-billion population 
crash in 50 years, by 5%.  That's 5500 lives/day.

Range voting gives you more "bang" for your buck than almost any other philanthropic option.
Maybe the most lives saved for this small an effort.
And you can be in the steep part of the learning curve by seeding the <i>start</i> of

<H2> Barro's multiD least-square fit, cross-country study  </H2>

<a href="BarroGDPfit.html"><img src="BarroPlot.png" width="527" height="697" 
alt="Barro's democracy vs GDP growth-rate plot" hspace="10" align="right"></a>

<p>
Book R.J.Barro:
<a href="RVPapers.html">Determinants of Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Empirical Study</a>
predicts growth rate of country's real GDP 
from facts about country.
GDP growth enhanced by:
<ul>
<li> 
low <i>initial</i> per capita real
GDP  (then tech transfer causes fast growth; 
appears to be biggest effect in Barro's list)
</li><li> 
more secondary and higher levels of schooling, 
</li><li> 
longer life expectancy (which presumably means good health)
</li><li> 
lower fertility rates, 
</li><li> 
lower government expenditures as GDP fraction
</li><li> 
more "rule of law"
</li><li> 
favorable trade relations with other countries (e.g. the USA made trade with Cuba
illegal, severely hurt Cuban economy) 
</li><li> 
high inflation (over 20% annually) kills economic growth
</li><li> 
<i>Democracy</i>.
</ul>

<p>
<i>But</i> democracy increases GDP in peculiar way (pictured):
increases in Barro's  political rights index from 0 to 5.6 on a scale of 0-10
(yielding a moderate level of freedom and democracy)
increased GDP growth rates additively by 2.6% 
<i>but</i> a further increase in the index from 5.6 to 10
<i>retarded</i> growth by <i>negative</i> 1.6%.
</p>

<p>
All of Barro's causative
factors (listed) cause approximately equal additive effects on predicted
real-GDP-growth-rate,
namely about 2-5% each.  That is, having the optimum level 5.6 of political rights
causes about 2.6% higher (additively) annual GDP growth rate than the pessimal
level 0;  countries about one standard deviation above usual in education levels are
predicted to have about 3% higher than usual annual-GDP-growth;
etc.
</p>

<p>
Correlation&ne;certainty so
democracy does not force a good economy.  E.g, China  doing better than India.
</p>

<H3> Why that peaking and downturn? </H3>

<p>
<b>Barro</b>
ideologically tries to explain by postulating:
more democracy &rArr; more government income redistribution &rArr; hurts growth.
But <b>attackable</b> because
Barro's fit <i>already</i> had incorporated government
expenditures
as <i>different</i> predictor; democratization was only being fit to
<i>unexplained</i> part of the GDP growth above and beyond that explainable
as  result of government outlays.
Barro partly
defends by saying that government <i>transfer</i> payments were <i>not</i> 
held constant.
But, assuming Barro has
idea that transfers aim toward <i>equalizing</i> wealth,
he is exactly <i>wrong</i> about its economic effect: 
the <a href="RVPapers.html">Deininger-Squires 1998 World Bank cross-country
study</a>
found that greater initial inequality is strongly <i>negatively</i> correlated
to future economic growth!
</p>

<p>
<small>
In other words, the "trickle down theory" often associated with Ronald Reagan
is wrong.
According to
George R. G. Clarke:
More Evidence on Income Distribution and Growth,
J. Development Economics 47,2 (Aug. 1995) 403-427,
"This conclusion is robust across different inequality measures,
and to many different specifications of the growth regression.
Furthermore, inequality appears to have a negative effect on
<i>both</i> democracies and non-democracies.
Interaction terms between inequality and regime type, when included in the
base regression, do not affect the sign or significance of [this]."
So this seems to settle the matter. (However, to <i>completely</i> clarify matters,
it would be good to put transfer payments into Barro's fit also, to see what happens.
And two other good predictors to try inserting would be a country's winter temperature
and the "centralization fraction" of its government 
[See A.Lijphart: <i>Democracies</i> 1984 table 10.2 page 178].)
</small>
</p>

<p>
<b>Two other possible explanatory hypotheses:</b> 
(more supported than Barro's):
<ol type="a">
<li> 
More democracy &rArr; dumb people make more dumb decisions &rArr; worse economic growth.
</li> 
<li> 
Even smart people make dumb decisions if the "decision-making algorithm" is "a poor
voting system."  If so, then replacing voting system with better one, e.g.
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, would yield
big  economic growth win, and that peak &amp; downturn
might be avoidable &ndash; the curve instead would just keep going up!
</li> 
</ol>
Which?  (Or both?)
If b &rArr; economic growth win attainable by switch to
Range or other better Voting 
appears <i>greater than attainable by altering any other factor</i> identified by Barro
(also seems much <i>easier</i> to change  voting system than to alter
any of those other factors).

<H2> <i>Why</i> is RV best?  (Aside from "because my computer says so.") </H2>

</li><li> Not initially so obvious versus Condorcet, but... (a) if enough voter honesty,
then RV can avoid "tyranny of majority" surpassing Condorcet and every other usual method;
(b) if strategic voters, can prove theorem that RV yields (under reasonable assmptns)
the honest-voter Condorcet winner!

Immunity to candidate "cloning" and "removal."
</li>
<li>
Immunity to "DH3 pathology" (Dark horse plus 3 rivals)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's also <b>psychological reasons</b>,
<b>tactical reasons</b>,  and <b>"secondary effects"...</b>
</p>
<p>
Let's look into all these in a little more depth...
</p>

<hr>

<H2> Some theorems saying range voting reacts <i>mildly</i> to <i>strategic</i> voting </H2>

<p><b>Avoids favorite betrayal:</b>
In range voting, there is never a strategic reason to give your favorite a non-top score.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where favorite-betrayal often advisable.)
</p>

<p><b>Semi-honesty:</b>
In range voting, if you know all other votes (or in a &le;3-candidate election
even if you have only partial knowledge of the other votes), 
then there is always a strategically-optimal
"semi-honest" threshold-style vote, where create a "threshold" <font color="red">T</font> and
give all candidates better than <font color="red">T</font> score=99, all others score=0.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where it can happen
that every honest &amp; semi-honest vote is non-strategic.)
</p>

<p><b>Pleasant surprise theorem:</b>
Suppose each voter chooses <font color="red">T</font>=their expectation of the value of the winner.
Then: the range-winner will maximize the number of voters who are "pleasantly surprised"
(result exceeds expectations).   That's an optimality property related to,
but not identical to, minimizing Bayesian regret.
</p>

<p><b>Range&rArr;Condorcet theorem:</b>
Suppose each chooses <font color="red">T</font> 
somewhere between candidates C and A, where C and A are viewed
as the two most likely to win.  If one of C or A is an honest-voter Condorcet
winner, then he will also be the range-winner.  (Suggests that in practice,
Condorcet cannot have much advantage over range.)
</p>

<hr>


<H2>  Voter Honesty (or lack thereof) </H2>

<ul>
<li>
&asymp;90% of people saying they'd vote Nader in 2000 voted for somebody else. 
[<a href="http://www.umich.edu/~nes">NES</a> data.]
</li>
<li>
1950 Gallup poll: 38% of British voters wanted to vote Liberal but only 9% did.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?  Strategy.  Don't want to "waste vote."  (&rArr; all previous BR studies, with only
"honest voters," are of little interest.  Also all previous left out RV.)

19-voter example illustrating

&quot;<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>.&quot;
<b>B wins</b>
under vast variety of rank-order election methods (e.g. Borda, Condorcet-LR, IRV).
</p>
<p>
<i>But</i> if the six
N>G>B voters <a href="AlteredExagg.html">insincerely switch</a>
to G>N>B ("<i><a href="FBCsurvey.html">betraying their favorite</a></i>" N)
then the "lesser evil" <b>G</b> becomes

</p>

<p>
This favorite-betrayal example very important because, once voters understand 
exaggerating their stances on the apparent-frontrunners can be necessary to
prevent "greater evil"s victory, strategic voting is guaranteed, often causing
"third parties" to tend to die out (since the strategic voters won't
"waste their vote" on honest-favorite third-party candidates like N whom they perceive as
having "no chance of winning").

Condorcet: <b>A</b> should win.
(A also wins under <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting method.)
Borda: no, <b>B</b> should win!
Who really should win?  Good question.
</p>
<p>
How would range voting handle this?
RV allows voters to say <i>how much</I> they
prefer B over A (or whoever).  <i>Quantitatively</i>.
Really, Borda or Condorcet are <i>both</i> right  &ndash; but  depending
on intensity-of-preference information  unavailable to their voting methods,
but available to range voting.  So this example illustrates an advantage of range voting
over both previous voting systems.

Cloning the Bores &rArr; huge advantage!   Boring party can just arrange for mucho
Bores to enter the race &amp; totally Boring!
Of course,  Mushites could try to defeat that by intentionally lying in their
votes by ranking 
Bores in  opposite of true order, to try to cancel out
the Borites and make Mush win.  
But this strategy causes them to be massively dishonest in
their votes and risk not only a Bore-victory, but in fact a victory
by the <i>worst</i> of the Bores!  (Which would in fact happen if the Borons
<i>counter</i>strategized by <i>also</i> being dishonest in their Bore-orderings!)

<b>B wins</b>  lefthand 100-voter example IRV election.
(G, with the fewest top-rank votes, is eliminated in 1st round
then B wins 55 to 45 over N.)  <i>Realistic</i> scenario
from voters and candidates positioned along 1-dimensional line.
</p>

<p>
At right, suppose 8 voters in bottom faction cleverly (but dishonestly) 
switch their top-2 preference order.
Then
N is eliminated in the <i>first</i> round,
and then in the second round <b>G wins</b> over B 73-to-27.
From those 8 voters' point of view, this was an improvement.
<b>Betraying Nader Pays in IRV</b>.   Voting Nader causes <b>spoiler</b> effect still in IRV.

<b>II.</b>
In this 24-voter IRV election, <b>A wins</b> after C is dropped.
But now suppose every voter <i>reverses</i> his preference order (now
attempting to choose worst rather than best).
In that case  A <i>still</i> wins after B is eliminated.
I.e. <i>IRV contradicts itself</i>; IRV's unambiguously
"best" candidate A is here
the same as its "worst"!  
<p>
<p>
Also illustrates bizarre kind of strategic voting:  Suppose
3 of the B>C>A voters reverse their votes to A>C>B (or alter them to A>B>C; that also works).
Then B is eliminated whereupon C wins 13-to-11 over A.
The <i>raising</i> of A from bottom-to-top in their vote caused A to <i>lose</i> &ndash;
and voting maximally dishonestly as though they were suicidally
trying to elect the <i>worst</i>
candidate, was actually <i>optimal strategy</i>!
</p>
<p>
Also illustrates "no show paradox":
If those three B>C>A voters had simply <i>refused to vote</i>,
then C would have won (an improvement in their view).   
Different way of saying the same thing:
these three voters' decision to cast an honest A-last vote
caused A to win.
</p>

<hr>

<H2>  "Secondary effects" </H2>

<p>
"Primary" effect (reckoned using Bayesian regret): 
just who wins the election &amp; how
much utility that is.   "Secondary" effects exert themselves over historical
time in sequence of many elections.  When these also reckoned, RV looks even better...
</p>

<p>
<b>2-party domination:</b>  
In systems where "favorite betrayal" common enough,
"2-party domination" happens (third parties die out).   2PD quickly became massive (&gt;99.5%)
in the USA (plurality voting) since "idiotic to waste vote by voting Nader."
2PD also experimentally has always happened under IRV, despite moronic propaganda
(<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>,
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a>).
2PD has <i>not</i> happened under plur+top-2-runoff.  ("Duverger's laws.")
2PD <i>might</i> happen under Condorcet systems.
</p>

<p><b>Consequent diminution of voter choice:</b>
Bush &amp; Kerry: <i>pro</i>, versus <i>all</i> third-party canddts <i>against</i>:
PATRIOT act, WTO, NAFTA, "war on drugs," Iraq war, subsidy-laden "farm bill,"
(tax cuts leading to) huge budget deficit.   
</p>

<p>
<b><i>One</i>-party domination:</b>
98% <a href="OneParty.html">predictability</a>
in contemporary USA.
(One reason is gerrymandering... by which one party can stay permanently in power
even if only 25+&epsilon;% support.)
</p>

<p><b>Cash:</b>
is extremely important in plurality voting, but perceived to be less so in other systems
e.g. plur+top-2-runoff.  Why?  Need to demonstrate you are one of the top-2 "frontrunners,"
i.e. create illusion of winnability, otherwise not worth wasting vote on you.
That's expensive.  (Educating about issues: cheap.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Media:</b>
Pays no attention to third-party views (no motivation; they're not news).
Media "lapdogs" unquestioningly accept politicians' BS without much
critical examination  (because with 2-party and 1-party domination, politicians
are in monopoly  position to cut off media lifeblood; with multiparties no
such info monopoly)
</p>

<p>
<b>Lack of congressional oversight:</b>
For most of about 8 years, Democrats in Congress haven't been able to subpoena anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rubberstamped agency heads &amp; judge appointments:</b>
In votes for court of 
appeals nominees, Republican Senators during the Bush administration (during
majority control) produced 2703 votes for the nominee as opposed to only a <i>single</i>
"no" vote (cast by Trent Lott against judge Roger Gregory, the
first Black ever appointed to this position).
</p>
<img src="HurricaneMoney.png" alt="Hurricane protection money budget figures" align="right">
<p>
Bush appointed Joseph Allbaugh as head of FEMA in 2001, although Allbaugh had no 
expertise or experience handling emergencies, but rather had been
then-Texas-Governor Bush's chief of staff &amp; campaign manager for 
Bush-Cheney nationwide campaign. 
(Allbaugh had B.S. in political science from Oklahoma State University.) 
In 2003, Allbaugh replaced by Michael D. Brown &ndash;
Former estate and family lawyer and bar examiner. The Boston Herald reports that Brown was "fired from his last private-sector job, overseeing horse shows... after a spate of lawsuits over alleged supervision failures... `He was asked to resign,' Bill Pennington, president of the IAHA at the time, confirmed last night." 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pork &amp; earmark game-playing:</b>
<p>
<b>FEMA</b> (Federal Emergency Management Agency),
in  report well before both Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 attack, summarized top
3 threats to the USA as a terrorist attack on New York, major earthquake in 
San Francisco and hurricane strike on New Orleans. 
But Bush and Congress by bipartisan budget vote
turned down
Louisiana's requests for mere tens of <i>millions</i>
per year to protect
New Orleans.  
New Orleans contained 
urban &amp; poor people, many blacks, hence a high% Democrat voters;
Louisiana had democrat senator,
&amp; <b>starting in 2004, a democrat governor</b>.
</p>

<p>
Compare with:
$28 <i>billion</i> embassy (constructing in Iraq);
$231 million for Alaska bridge between 
Gravina Island (population&lt;50) &amp;
Ketchikan (pop. 8,000);
Wyoming $31 million in anti-terrorism funding in 2003 (more per capita than any state).

Pseudo-election
with real US voters (122 range 
&amp; 656 approval)
simultaneously with the 2004 presidential election (as exit poll).
Note <b>RV psychological drive for human honesty</b> &rArr;
<b>"nursery effect"</b> &rArr; RV far more likely than AV to
encourage growth of small third parties &rArr; enabling escape from 2-party domination,
media lapdogs, rubberstamped party hack agency heads &amp; judges,  etc.

of Carter, under approval voting, whereas under plurality voting he was far 
in third place with under 7% of the votes.

<H2> Psychology-aided effects </H2>

<p>
RV has some further advantages perhaps not mathematically explainable, but which instead are
<i>experimental</i> facts that are consequences of human psychology:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Altruism:</b>
Range Voters exhibit unstrategic honesty to far greater degree than plurality voters.
(76% of RV ballots manifestly unstrategic...  versus: 90% of the time US <i>plurality</i> voters 
can choose between strategic V honest, they pick strategic.)
</li><li>
<b>Nursery effect</b> follows: third parties should favor RV (unless death wish)
</li><li>
Range (and approval) voters have <b>low</b> ballot-invalidating <b>error rates</b>, 
while IRV voters
have high rates.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
Plurality: 1.0-3.1% spoiled (6 countries).  IRV: 3.4-6.2% spoiled (Australia 8 territories).
</td></tr></table>
Also &ge;7X increase IRV vs plurality spoilage rate in SF.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
French 2002 approval study: 2.0% spoilage for official plurality votes, 0.3% for
approval exit-poll votes.
</td></tr></table>
Range: 0.026% spoilage rate (per <i>candidate</i>) observed in our exit poll; 99.5% confidence
that range rate per canddt is at least twice as small as USA's plurality error rate of 1.8%.
One reason:
RV &amp; AV: every way to fill in scores is legal.  IRV &amp; plurality: not so.
Another(?): range &amp; approval voters repeatedly do the same operation many times in each race,
causing them to be more careful and inherently self-checking.  (Plurality: do it only once.)

That'll reduce fraud-like Florida-style election manipulation.

<!-- Harvard Law School Civil Rights Project: of the
2 million ballots spoiled in a typical presidential election, about <i>half</i> are cast by

<ol>
<li>  Iowa caucuses get tremendous media attention, have tremendous

Mucho <i>publicity</i> for range voting.
</li>

<li>  Appears can change the rules without altering state or federal
law, only Dem. &amp; Repub. party internal procedures, central committee.
<i>Easier target.</i>
</li>
<li>  Iowa caucuses use pen &amp; paper ballots &amp; manual totaling (hand calculators
or adding machines).
Hence can easily institute single-digit range voting &ndash; essentially 
<i>no complexity penalty</i>
versus approval &amp; plurality.
</li>

<li> Both the Dems &amp; Repubs (at all levels: rank-and-file members countrywide
and Iowa-wide, Iowa state party leaders, national party leaders), 
are <i>motivated</i> to <i>want</i> to use
range so they can get a <a href="PlurPrim.html">better presidential nominee</a>,
and seem in favor of reform, and get free publicity;  Iowans may also
be in favor of change since many may believe Kerry (or Bush) was a mistake by them.
</li>
<li>  Because expect 10 Dem &amp; 10 Repub candidates, range voting will
have maximized <i>quality advantage</i> versus
plurality &amp; approval.  <a href="RandElect.html#RangePlur">Computer sims</a>:

<p><b>Abstract:</B>
Revolutionary new protocol called "3ballot" introduced September 2006 by 
Ron Rivest. 
Accomplishes  seemingly incompatible goals:
</P>

<ol>

<li>
 Each voter's vote is secret, preventing vote-selling and coercion.
(Even if voter <i>wants</i> to reveal her vote, she cannot.)
</li>
<li>
Each voter can verify her
vote was not discarded,
was correctly used and not altered, in  computing election result. 
(And if not, voter in position to
<i>prove</i> vote counters cheated.)
</li>
<li>
Everybody can verify election result  computed correctly.
</li>
<li>
Everybody can verify that extra fake "voters" were not added;
full list of voters is publically known.
</li>
<li>
Whole protocol can be done <i>without</i>
computers or cryptography &ndash; only low-tech devices like paper and pens are 
needed &ndash; and is so simple it can be understood by children. 
<small>
(It is also possible to put in computers and cryptography; several flavors  possible.)
</SMALL>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Interestingly, 3ballot turns out to work most naturally, securely, and simply, 
for <a href="AppExec.html">approval voting</a> and
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>. 
It still works &ndash;
but less naturally, securely, and simply for
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting 
(the kind of voting currently most common throughout the USA and world) &ndash;
and it essentially does not work at all for voting methods based on rank-order ballots 
such as <a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting</a>.  (There is a way to
<i>try</i> to do it for
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
and
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>
voting,
<i>but</i> the <a href="RouseCond.html">resulting scheme</a> is vulnerable to the
reconstruction
and
and specified-pattern attacks, i.e. is 
a clear failure in elections with 12 or more
candidates.  And  can't even <i>try</i> &ndash;
3ballot does not work at all for &ndash;
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff (IRV)</a>.)
</p>
</p>
<p>
<small>
Actually, Rivest's original plan was intended for plurality voting,
but turned out not to work because it permitted vote-buying.
I pointed out to Rivest, though, that 
(a) <i>did</i> work for approval and for
range voting; 
(b) modification of his idea called "BOFFO" 
(simplifiable to "OFF"),
works for plurality voting; (c) can also be made immune to all collusive attacks.
I presume later versions will appear of the Rivest paper
which will incorporate these improvements and fixes.  They are, at any rate,
described here.  </small>

<hr>

<H2>Secure 0-9 Range Voting (do 0-1, easier, for Approval) via 3-ballot:</H2>



<ol>
<li>
Voter decides (for some given candidate "Gladstone") what score S, on an 0-9 scale, to
award Gladstone.
</li><li>
Voter submits 3 ballots about Gladstone, with scores A,B,C where
A+B+C=S+9 and 0&le;A&le;9 and 0&le;B&le;9 and 0&le;C&le;9.
Simultaneously she signs form saying "I, <u>Jill Voter</u>, 
address <u>57 Bogus Road, Baloney Town</u> certify  I just scored
Gladstone."   (And shows ID to the polling officials...)

</li><li>
Trivially simple machine (a) checks that these 3 ballots obey the 9&le;A+B+C&le;18
and 0&le;A,B,C&le;9 rules.
(b) drops them into a glass-walled
bin in random order, and (c) spits out a government-certified 
official ballot copy ("receipt") of <i>one</i> of the three ballots, for the voter to take home
and keep in a safe place.  
It is important that (i) this machine be so simple
&ndash; preferably <i>not</i> computerized &ndash;
that cannot possibly be
<i>remembering</i> the ballot-triple 
and (ii) it is the <i>voter</i> 
who chooses which of the three to copy.
<blockquote>
Worried that this might be too complicated for voters (especially
Florida voters) or for a <i>non</i>computerized
checking machine?  Check out <a href="JKMechAdd.html">Jan Kok's remark</a>.
</blockquote>
</li><li>
Government posts all ballots in all bins onto world-readable bulletin board.
For example, if you approval-voted for Gladstone, then up there on that bulletin board,
somewhere, will be your 3 ballots saying "I approve Gladstone,"
"I approve Gladstone" ,
and
"I disapprove Gladstone"
respectively.  
Also posted (on another list) will be the names &amp; addresses of all the voters who voted
about Gladstone.
</li><li>
Anybody can now total the votes to find candidate with 
highest average score (election winner).
</li><li>
The voter can check that her vote was used in unaltered form
by simply going to the bulletin board and looking
up ballot number 16674568703  (Or whatever; it says 
number on her official copy)  and comparing.
[If differ, raise hell.]
<small>Note. It is important to prevent vote-buying that voter <i>cannot remember</i>
the ballot numbers on the ballots she does <i>not</i> get a copy of.
Hard to remember large numbers, especially if really are pixelated "bar codes." 
But even for voters who
<i>can</i> remember these (or have camera) then
<i>still</i> can achieve 
security by using <a href="ScratchOff.html">scratch-off tricks</a>
suggested by Danny Sleator.
</small>
</li><li>
Voter can also check that her name is on the list (lookup "Jill Voter").
</li><li>
Reporters can check that the names posted on the list really are of real people
who live at their addresses and who agree that they voted about Gladstone.
[If not, raise hell.]
</li></ol>

<H3> Why the talliers cannot alter your vote and cheat </H3>
<p>
Yes, an evil government <i>could</i> alter the two
votes/scores Jill Voter cast that she does <i>not</i>
have a certified copy of, <i>but</i>
govt does not <i>know which</i> those two were
&ndash;
so if tries, liable to mess with the one she has copy of, 
enabling her to prove cheating happened.
If any substantial number of votes are altered, 
cheat-detection essentially certain.
</p>

<H3> Why you can't sell your vote or be coerced </H3>
<p>
Because your vote secret.
So vote-buyer or coercer cannot be sure you really
voted the way he wanted.
Even if you intentionally show vote-buyer your receipt,
vote-buyer still has absolutely no idea how you really voted
in total because
cannot see the other parts of your vote 
(for which you have no receipt) &ndash; all
possibilities still open.  (Even if you swear a sacred oath that you voted
for Bozo in those other parts, you have no way to prove it to the vote buyer.  Might
swear another oath to another buyer tomorrow, that you voted for Clodnik!)
</p>

<hr>

<H2>Secure Plurality Voting via BOFFO (also showing how to defend
against collusive attacks):</H2>

<p>
Assume N-candidate election for some N&ge;2.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Voter decides for which of the N she wishes to vote.
Suppose candidate she chooses is <i>B</i>ozo.
</li><li>
Voter also chooses two other candidates, call them for concreteness
<i>O</i>sbert and <i>F</i>oo.  These could be anybody.   It is also allowed
for Osbert and Bozo to be same (or Osbert and Foo to be same, or
all three same, or all three different).
</li><li>
Voter submits these 5 ballots:
<table border="2" cellpadding="1">
<tr bgcolor="#ffeeee"><td>FOR</td><td>Bozo</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffeeee"><td>FOR</td><td>Osbert</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffeeee"><td>FOR</td><td>Foo</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="aqua"><td>AGAINST</td><td>Foo</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="aqua"><td>AGAINST</td><td>Osbert</td></tr>
</table>
Simultaneously she signs form saying "I, <u>Jill Voter</u>, 
address <u>57 Bogus...</u> certify I just voted."
(And shows ID to the polling officials...)
</li><li>
Trivially simple machine (a) checks that these 5 ballots obey the BOFFO format
rules above (i.e. there are exactly 3 FOR and 2 AGAINST votes (in some order,
not necessarily the order shown) that include two FOR-AGAINST canceling-out pairs,
(b) drops them into bin in random order, and (c) spits out <i>two</i>
government-certified 
official ballot copies ("receipt") of either
<ol type="A">
<li>
<i>two</i> of Jill's five ballots
[she chooses which two], or
</li><li>
<i>one</i> copy [she chooses which one) <i>plus</i>
a copy of  one of the ballots cast by a previous voter
and randomly selected from the bin.
</li></ol>
Jill Voter takes these two official copies home with her
for safekeeping.  Which of {A,B} happens, is made randomly by flipping
a coin or some other obviously random process (or could be chosen by the voter
&ndash; both work, but I prefer randomness for this purpose) and is not known to
anybody besides the voter and not remembered by the machine.
<small><b>Note:</b>
The fancy trick here of using (A) <i>or</i> (B) is intended for later use
in protecting against collusive attacks.  If we were not worried about
collusive attacks, then we could just do (A) <i>only</i>, or even more simply,
just give Jill <i>one</i> copy of one of her 5 ballots [she chooses which]
to take home.
<br>
It's important that (i) this machine be so simple that it cannot possibly be
<i>remembering</i> the ballot-quintuple and (ii) it is the <i>voter</i> 
who chooses which one (or two) of the five to copy, and the machine cannot remember
which one or two it was [and we can allow it to
be an <i>obviously-random device</i> (rather than voter) which decides among
possibilities A or B, but the machine must not remember that either].
</small>
</li><li>
Government posts all ballots in all bins onto world-readable bulletin board.
For example, with this vote, up there on that bulletin board,
somewhere, will be your 5 ballots saying "FOR Bozo", "FOR Osbert", "AGAINST Osbert" etc.
Also posted (on another list) will be the names &amp; addresses of all the voters who voted
in this race.
</li><li>
Anybody can now total votes to find out  candidate with the 
largest number of votes (election winner) where each FOR vote counts as +1 and each AGAINST 
vote as -1.
</li><li>
The voter can check... [as before]
</li><li>
Reporters can check... [as before]
</li></ol>

<hr>
<H2>  Collusive attacks </H2>

<p>
Vote-buyers/coercers, evil vote-talliers, cannot cheat acting alone.
But "3-way collusions" with vote-sellers can zap the original 3ballot scheme...
(and <i>danger</i>: these "collusions" not as unlikely as collusions usually are...)
</p>

<p>
<b>Nasty Collusion Scenario 1:</b>
Bush voters urged to turn in their receipts, especially "FOR Clinton"
receipts (!), to Republican party officials in "watchdog" organization
for "safekeeping" and "own protection".
Repubs then get their hack-appointee (ala Ken Tomlinson) at elections commission
to alter all those "FOR Clinton" third-votes to "FOR Bush" and <i>burns</i> its
"FOR Clinton" receipt collection (since after all, its job is to
protest about altered "FOR Bush" votes...)
</p>

<p>
<b>Nasty Scenario 2:</b>
Receipts collected from Dumpsters used in same way.
</p>

<p>
<b>Nasty Scenario 3:</b>
Voter just goes to corrupt govt official and says "please! fake my ballots!"
and hands in her ballot receipts so they can be burned so nobody can
prove the fakery happened.
</p>

<p>
<b>Protection</b> is
afforded by the extra random copies... So Tom DeLay cannot be sure
there are not other copies floating around...  or that some "loyal
Republican" voters
not doublecrossing him...
</p>

<p>
<b>Result:</b>
scheme with these defenses now seems <i>also</i> immune to all collusive attacks too
(at least all the ones Rivest &amp; I could think of...)
</p>

<p>
<b>Closer look at why now collusion-resistant:</b>
For example, in nasty scenario #3, suppose Jill Voter hands in both her receipts to Dr.Evil
(corrupt govt official) &amp; says "please fake my vote."  Well, how  does Evil know that Jill
was not a B-type voter, in which case one of these receipts was really of a previously
cast (not by Jill) vote, in which case that previous voter may have a receipt?!
So Evil can't afford to alter those votes &ndash; he'd likely be caught
(and if Evil alters K votes, chance of being caught 
exponentially approaches 1 as K&rarr;&infin;).
Evil cannot afford to trust Jill's word she is type-A &ndash;
Jill might be an agent provocateur.
Even if Jill is the <i>first</i> voter of the day and everybody knows it (in
which case we know she is a type-A voter) then Evil still
stymied &ndash; some later voter could have a Jill-vote copy.
For <i>every single vote</i> there is a chance somebody unknown owns
a copy of that vote, hence <i>no</i> collusive attack can work without
detection.
</p>

<hr>

<H2> Odds and Ends </H2>

<p>
<b>OFF plan:</b>
Simpler than BOFFO is just OFF (Opposed, For, For = pro-O, pro-F, against-F) 
and (A) is "Voter gets one
of her 3 ballots copied" while (B) is "Voter gets one random previously-cast
[not by her] ballot copied."  This also works and it is superior
in the sense that 3 is simpler than 5.  Only botheration is
B-type OFF-voters cannot verify their <i>own</i> vote, which is
psychologically bad compared to BOFFO where all voters can verify
own vote.
</p>

<p>
<b>OFF<sub>2</sub> plan:</b>
To respond to that, make simpler-still OFF plan but now each voter
gets one copy of own ballot (voter chooses which) plus one random
copy of a previous
voter's ballot.
This also works.  (Note: very first voter of the day,
who only gets 1 copy, could via a collusion with govt arrange to
get 3 votes not 1? No, that won't work because a later voter might have
a copy of her vote...)
</p>

<p>
<b>Write-in ballots:</b>
<br>
Rivest Approval &amp; Range voting: no problem to do write-ins.
<br>
BOFFO/OFF Plurality voting: we must forbid write-in voting
because that brings back redundant info with a vengeance.

and all those ridiculously-unique names had better be there.

<p><b>Borda and Condorcet voting:</b>
Michael A. Rouse <a href="RouseCond.html">invented</a>
way to do these, but it is vulnerable to
specified pattern attack and is unuseable if too many candidates (e.g.
if &ge;12 candidates , then is insecure, but fine if only a few).
And IRV (which is non-additive) does not even work at all &ndash; even if only
3 candidates.  Also with Rouse's scheme, again write-ins must be forbidden.
</p>

<p><b>Same anti-collusion tricks</b> can also be added to approval &amp; range voting
3ballot plan, of course.
</p>

<p><b>Hassle:</b>
Combining <i>both</i>
<a href="ScratchOff.html">scratch-off</a> &amp;
anticollusion tricks makes procedures pretty disgusting.
For that reason the scratch-off tricks are probably not desirable in practice (?).
</p>

<p><b>Randomization? Bad idea.</b>
Schemes where a random device, not the voter, select which ballot to copy, or
select how to fill in the 3 (or 5) ballots for the voter, do not work;
permit "statistical vote-buying."  (It's about adversaries, not
randomization.)
</p>

<hr>

<H2> Bundling &ndash; Just say no! </H2>

<p>
<b>Do not bundle</b>
multiple races onto one ballot.  And with approval and range,
do not bundle multiple candidates onto one ballot (all candidates are independently
scored and should be on seperate mini-ballots).
Pointless bundling enables selected-pattern attack.
</p>

<p><b>Linked Numbers attack:</b>
A lot of people had ideas where there would be one ballot for the voter to fill out
but then it would be <i>cut apart</i> into many little slips of paper, each with its
own serial number pre-printed on it, and only these would be posted
on the bulletin board in <i>unbundled</i> form.  
This would be more convenient for the voter
and would allow bundling without worries...
<b>But that does not work!!</b>
Because the "different and unrelated" serial numbers in fact could be
related in a way known only to Dr.Evil at the ballot-printing office, 
permitting him to
know trivially how everybody voted.
</p>

<p>
This attack devastates numerous ideas.
Danny Sleator proposed the <a href="SleatorCheapo.html">cheapo</a> semi-secure
plan intended to be simpler, more practical, and more like current procedures,
than ours (at the cost of only being semi-secure).
However, Sleator still needs to debundle, considerably 
decreasing the 
attractiveness of his cheapo plan, if he wants to avoid this vote-selling-to-Dr-Evil
attack.
