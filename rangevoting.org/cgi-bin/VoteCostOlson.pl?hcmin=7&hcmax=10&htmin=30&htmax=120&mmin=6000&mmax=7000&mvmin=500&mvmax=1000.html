<H2> Voting cost calculator - which is cheaper, machine or manual count? </H2>

Which is cheaper, manual vote vounting, or machine vote counting?  The answer may surprise
you.  Type your assumptions into the slots, hit "submit," and see what conclusions result.
Note: this calculator is somewhat incomplete in that it
does not include maintenance, testing, transport, and storage costs for the machines,
nor does it include training costs for the people (and on the other hand, people have to
be trained to use the machines...).  When entering numbers,
keep in mind that with human counting,
ballots often have to be counted by more than one human as part of "don't trust you" protocols.
