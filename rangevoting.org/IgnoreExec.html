<H2> Ignoring your votes  (Executive Summary) </H2>

<p>
Nobody likes to be ignored.
But in 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>,
a correct algorithm that computes the winner always ignores (i.e. never looks at)
asymptotically 100% of
the entries in the rank-order votes.
Indeed, always, the algorithm looks at a fraction &le;F of the VC entries
(in a V-voter, C-candidate election) where
<center>
 F &le; (1+1/3+1/4+&hellip;+1/C) / C.
</center>
This upper bound tends to 0% when C is made large.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, with <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>, 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>, Borda, plurality, and Condorcet voting,
no correct algorithm can always avoid looking at 100% (or nearly) of the entries
in the votes.  (However, it certainly can <i>sometimes</i> avoid it, e.g. if the first 51%
of the votes examined are all for Lincoln, then with plurality voting we'd know the winner
without needing to examine the remaining 49%.)
</p>
<p>
IRV voters have to ask themselves why they are being asked to fill out a rather large ballot
of rank orderings when in fact almost everything they write will always be ignored.
