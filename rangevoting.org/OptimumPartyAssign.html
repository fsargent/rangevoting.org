<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>
If, in an election, each district attempted to elect its MP using 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>, then the resulting parliament could
be disproportional.  I.e: each voter
rates each candidate with a numerical score from (say) 0=bad to 9=good.
That causes each candidate to acquire an average score.  
<i>But</i> if each district then just elected whoever 
had the highest average score, the resulting parliament could
be "disproportional."
</p><p>
A possible solution to that problem is to demand that the parliament have
a prescribed party composition (proportional to the number of voters who had awarded each party
their top rating), and <i>among all possible parliaments meeting the party-composition constraints
and 1-seat-per-district constraint,
finding the "best" one, i.e. the one <u>maximizing</u> the sum of the average scores
of all its MPs.</i>  We'll show that this optimization problem is efficiently soluble using 
&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear programs</a>&quot; (LPs)
of a well understood type arising in optimal "weighted bipartite graph matching."
</p><p>
When the "dual form" of our linear program is studied, we find that it is quite similar to
&ndash; but <i>not</i> the same as &ndash; the "Fair Majority Voting"
scheme <a href="BalinskiFairMajGerry.pdf">proposed</a>
by Michel Balinski in 2008.  The reason it is not the same is that Balinski made
a severe design error.  He, in our terminology, optimized the wrong thing.
(Although actually, Balinski did not really realize he was optimizing anything.)
The right thing to optimize must approximate perceived society-wide "utility."
Balinski optimizes something rather unrelated to that, whereas we optimize the obvious
natural approximation to it.
But it is possible to alter the Balinski proposal to remove his
"multiplicative weights" by replacing them with "additive offsets."
When that is done, Balinski's altered system becomes essentially equivalent to ours via
an LP-duality, 
aside from his preference for <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style 
"name-one-candidate" ballots
as opposed to our preference for
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting
style "rate-all-candidates"  ballots.
</p><p>
Also, still more embarrassingly for Balinski, he contended his system would
"eliminate <a href="GerryExec.html">gerrymandering</a>" by removing all incentive for it.
That claim was total garbage, and displays a massive lack of understanding by Balinski of
what gerrymandering is like in the USA and why it happens.
</p><p>
Both our proposal and Balinski's enjoy the virtues of electing exactly one MP per district,
<i>and</i> achieving 
proportional representation (<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a>)
as measured by party-fractions.
</p><p>
However, they also both suffer the disadvantage that <i>parties</i> are woven into
the very fabric of the voting system definition.  A government based on either system
would need to forbid, or at least be very unfriendly to, unaffiliated candidates;
and it probably would be deemed necessary to enact laws forbidding MPs from switching parties
(countries have enacted such laws since they felt otherwise their
PR systems could be "gamed").  I greatly prefer systems based entirely on
candidates with no reference to parties, and which work equally well regardless of
who is in what party, or whether parties even exist.
</p><p>
Also, we demonstrate another massive disadvantage of both schemes (Balinski's method 
is afflicted more severely than ours, but both seem severely damaged):
they are hugely susceptible to a simple organized 
form of strategic voting I call "targeted killing."
I would forecast that any country trying to use either scheme to elect its parliament would
be devastated by this problem.
</p><p>
I think these disadvantages render both schemes, especially Balinski's,
unacceptable for the basic design of the government of a country. 
</p><p>
(Also, more generally, <i>any</i> of a wide class of PR schemes
involving explicit use of party labels as part of their definitions, <i>might</i> be vulnerable to an
analogous problem, which should be a very scary thought for anybody designing such a system. 
Play it safe by refusing to involve party labels in your system. 
Or watch out.)
</p><p>
But there is a possible salvage.  Do not use our scheme as the election method.  
Instead merely use
it as a "top up" method to try to restore PR to an otherwise
single-winner-per-district parliament
elected by old fashioned independent single-district single-winner elections.
(Note: Our LP formulation can also be used to find the optimum parliament with 
prescribed party-composition such that district k elects N<sub>k</sub>
MP's, where the integers N<sub>k</sub>&ge;0
can be anything, not necessarily all 1 or all equal.)
When used for this top-up purpose, our method becomes a far less attractive "target" for
"killings."  And then it actually <i>might</i> be a decent way to design a government, at least if you
can stomach being force-fed political parties...
</p>

<h3> The voting system </h3>
<p><b>Purpose.</b>
To elect a W-seat parliament, consisting of one MP per district, in such a way that
the party-composition of the parliament, mirrors that of the voters.
We assume some number C&gt;W of candidates run and at least one candidate runs in each district.
</p><p>
Extension: we could optimally make district k elect R<sub>k</sub> MPs,
for any pre-specified set of non-negative integers R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, ... summing to W;
they do not need to all equal 1.  Indeed, if desired we could even just pre-specify integer intervals 
[L<sub>k</sub>, R<sub>k</sub>] and merely demand district k elect a number x of MPs where
L<sub>k</sub>&le;x&le;R<sub>k</sub>.
</p>
<p><b>1.</b>
Each voter rates each candidate in her district, on an 0-to-9 numerical scale. 
(Voters also allowed to leave some candidates unrated, if that voter wishes not to express any 
opinion about that candidate.) 
<small>
Refinement suggested by J.Quinn: "Any voter who did not explicitly rate any candidates at 0 is considered 
to have given 0 to any candidates they left blank. Any voter who did rate at least one candidate explicitly 
at 0 is considered to have expressed 'no opinion' about any candidates they left blank. (I think this 
rule is the safest way to interpret 'intent of the voter'.)"</small>
</p><p><b>2.</b>
At this point, each candidate in each district possesses some "average score."
Also, each political party, nationwide, has a number of "points."  
(Each time a voter rates K candidates co-equal top,
then each of their political parties gets 1/K of a point.)
</p><p><b>3.</b>
Determine the number of seats each party "deserves" in parliament,. e.g. party j deserves N<sub>j</sub>
seats, for some set of non-negative integers S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, ... summing to W.
These S<sub>j</sub> could be produced from the party point-counts and W by, 
for example, the classical procedure of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method">Sainte-Lagu&euml;</a>. 
Extension: everything to follow could also more generally be done with 
integer <i>intervals</i> [S<sub>j</sub>, T<sub>j</sub>] where we shall demand that party j
gets a number x of seats with 
S<sub>j</sub>&le;x&le;T<sub>j</sub>.  
</p><p><b>4.</b>
Find, from among all possible ways to elect W of the candidates to parliament which meet
all the party seat-count constraints and also simultaneously meet all
the district MP-count constraints, the "best" possible choice, and elect those W.  Here "best" means
that the average scores possessed by the W elected MPs, have maximum possible sum.
(Note: if no parliament meeting all the constraints exists, then report that
failure and stop.  However, if the S<sub>j</sub> were produced via Sainte-Lagu&euml; as described in step 2, 
then a solution obviously will exist.)
</p>

<a name="IM"></a>
<h3>Why that voting method can be implemented efficiently &ndash; graph formulation and LP reformulation</h3>

<p>
We can view this as a problem about bipartite graphs (or bipartite multigraphs)
with edge weights, then solve it efficiently via linear programming.
Specifically, consider a bipartite graph with one red vertex for each political party, and
one blue vertex for each district.  The edge from party j to district k has numerical <i>weight</i>
equal to the average score possessed by the candidate from party j who ran in district k.
(If some party runs more than one candidate in some district, we'd need to make
multiple edges between those two vertices, and it'd be a bipartite <i>multi</i>graph.
That is ok.)
</p><p>
Our optimization problem then is a "max-weight constrained-valence subgraph" problem. 
That is, we seek a subgraph (W-element subset of the edges) of the original graph.
This subgraph must obey the "valence constraints" that, e.g. the number  &nu; of edges emerging
from the party-j red vertex, must obey 
S<sub>j</sub>&le;&nu;&le;T<sub>j</sub>.  And so on; each vertex of the original graph has its
own allowed-valency integer interval.  Among all possible subgraphs meeting
the valency constraints, our task is to find the one maximizing the sum of the edge-weights.
</p><p>
This graph problem has been heavily studied since the 1950s and consequently nowadays
is well understood.  One way to solve it is 
by reformulating it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear program</a>.
That works to provide a polynomial-time algorithm.  (However, it also is possible to 
solve it more quickly because this linear program happens to have special structure.
We won't discuss that.) 
</p><p>
Here is the linear program.
If there are P parties and D districts, then there are PD variables x<sub>jk</sub>.
(We are formulating this, for simplicity of notation, in the
ordinary-graph case.  Actually, in the multigraph case we really would need to index the x's by
which <i>edge</i> of the original multigraph that x pertained to.  In the ordinary graph case,
an edge is specified by its two endpoints, namely party j and district k, which simplifies notation.)
The meaning of x<sub>jk</sub> will be the number of candidates elected by party j from
district k, and this number after solution will always be
either 0 or 1.
These obey the linear inequality constraints
</p><center>
0 &le; x<sub>jk</sub> &le; 1, &nbsp;&nbsp; 
(&sum;<sub>1&le;j&le;P</sub>&sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;D</sub> x<sub>jk</sub> = W), &nbsp;&nbsp; 
S<sub>j</sub> &le; &sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;D</sub> x<sub>jk</sub> &le; T<sub>j</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp; 
M<sub>k</sub> &le; &sum;<sub>1&le;j&le;P</sub> x<sub>jk</sub> &le; N<sub>k</sub>.
</center><p>
Subject to those constraints, we find the x<sub>jk</sub> that maximize
</p><center>
&sum;<sub>1&le;j&le;P</sub>&sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;D</sub> x<sub>jk</sub> A<sub>jk</sub>
</center><p>
where A<sub>jk</sub> is the average score possessed by candidate jk.
</p><p>
Obviously, this is a linear program, and if its optimum solution happens to have all entries
x<sub>jk</sub> <i>integer</i>,
then that solution instantly solves our original graph problem optimally.
However, if we ignore the parenthesized
&sum;<sub>1&le;j&le;P</sub>&sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;D</sub> x<sub>jk</sub>=W
constraint, then it <i>automatically will</i> have all entries integer, because then this is a 
&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodular_matrix#Total_unimodularity#Total_unimodularity">totally unimodular</a>&quot; 
linear program 
with "integer right hand sides," due to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodular_matrix#Common_totally_unimodular_matrices#Common_totally_unimodular_matrices">Hoffman-Gale theorem</a>.
</p><p.
Warning: in maximally extended versions of our voting problem,
we actually may not be able via an LP solve to force
the parliament to have exactly W seats, because we need to leave out
the parenthesized constraint in order to enjoy total unimodularity, and if
we keep it in we may suffer non-integer solutions featuring "fractional seat occupancies."
(One could try different W values to see for which we luckily get an all-integer solution,
but some such attempts presumably will fail.)
</p><p>
Non-integer solutions would be inconvenient because politicians do not like being cut in half.
Hence for those problem versions we could end up having some other (i.e. not W) integer
number of seats consistent with all the other (nonparenthesized) constraints.
However in the unextended (or less extended) forms of our voting problem,
the W-seat demand will be satisfied automatically, even without explicitly imposing it,
 just because, e.g, the sum of the demanded 
district-occupancies equals W if all M<sub>k</sub>=N<sub>k</sub>.
</p>

<a name="DU"></a>
<h3> Dual form of our linear program </h3>

<p>
When we apply the linear programming 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Duality#Duality">duality theorem</a>,
we find our LP is equivalent to the following.  (We'll assume
S<sub>j</sub>=T<sub>j</sub>
and
M<sub>k</sub>=N<sub>k</sub>
for this purpose.)
Seek "additive adjustments" U<sub>j</sub>&ge;0
for party j and V<sub>k</sub>&ge;0 for district k
such that 
</p><center>
U<sub>j</sub> + V<sub>k</sub> &le; A<sub>jk</sub>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
and  &nbsp;&nbsp;
&sum;<sub>1&le;j&le;P</sub>S<sub>j</sub>U<sub>j</sub>
+
&sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;D</sub>N<sub>k</sub>V<sub>k</sub>
&nbsp;
is maximized.
</center><p>
We then elect the N<sub>k</sub> candidates in district k having
the maximum <i>adjusted</i> average score 
<nobr>A<sub>jk</sub>-U<sub>j</sub>-V<sub>k</sub>,</nobr>
for each k=1,2,3,...,D.
(The adjustments automatically will cause the resulting
parliament to obey the party-seat-occupancy demands.)
Equivalently, we elect 
the S<sub>j</sub> candidates in party j having
the maximum adjusted average score, for each j.
(Generically, the same winner-set will result either way.)
</p>

<a name="BA"></a>
<h3> Balinski's "fair majority voting" system, and its relationship (but inequivalence) to ours </h3>

<p>
Balinski's system begins by soliciting from each voter in each district a "name one candidate"
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style vote, saying their presumably-favorite candidate running
within their district.  Each such vote for a <i>candidate</i> also counts as a vote for his <i>party</i>.
Balinski then determines each party's "deserved" seat count, by applying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method">d'Hondt</a>'s method to the party vote counts.
(Balinski prefers d'Hondt, while I prefer Sainte-Lagu&euml;, for this purpose.
It perhaps is of interest that Germany's Bundestag originally used
d'Hondt, but as of 2005 has switched to Sainte-Lagu&euml;.)
</p><p>
Then 
"multiplicative adjustments" &rho;<sub>j</sub>&gt;0
for party j and &lambda;<sub>k</sub>&gt;0 for district k, are found, such that if the vote counts
are adjusted &ndash; i.e. any vote cast within district k is multiplied by 
&lambda;<sub>k</sub> and any vote cast for a party-j candidate
is multiplied by &rho;<sub>j</sub> &ndash; then
the winners in each district using adjusted votes, 
yield the deserved number of seats for each party.
</p><p>
So Balinski's system is the <i>same</i> as ours, except for the following changes:
</p><ol><li>
Balinski uses 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style ballots, while we use
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a>-style.
</li><li>
Balinski uses d'Hondt, we use Sainte-Lagu&euml;.  (Balinski claimed that was since he wanted the USA to
develop a "majority party" and d'Hondt made that more likely.  
Evidently Balinski felt for some mysterious reason that
the USA did not already have enough 2-party domination.
Polls of US citizens, however, disagree, with 60% finding the USA needs a third party.)
<br>
<img src="GallupUSthirdPartyNeed2015.png" alt="Gallup: Opinions of Need for a Third U.S. Political Party" />
</li><li>
Balinski uses <i>multiplicative</i> adjustments, while we use additive ones.  (But Balinski's
also are additive after logarithmically transforming everything, 
in which sense his and my methods are "the same.")
</li></ol>
<p>
While I believe all three of these choices by Balinski were unwise,
the last one was truly absurd, because...
</p>

<a name="WR"></a>
<h3> What Balinski's LP is optimizing and why that was the wrong thing to optimize </h3>

<p>
We optimize the right thing, namely, the sum, over all
MPs, of their average score reckoned by voters.  
This is the obvious naive approximation to the 
"quality" or "social utility" of the parliament, as estimated by voters.
Balinski maximizes the sum, over all MPs, of the <i>logarithm</i> of
their number of votes.  (Equivalently, he maximizes the <i>product</i> of
their vote-counts.)  This has little relation to anything utilitarian.
</p>

<a name="TK"></a>
<h3> How "targeted killing" strategic voting method would devastate Balinski's system and render it
utterly unfit for direct use in designing the government of a country 
</h3>

<p>
With Balinski, the NaziLoon party (which gets 1% of the votes and hence deserves 1% of the seats)
necessarily will enjoy a multiplicative scale-up factor of about 50,
as compared with the Mainstream party (which gets 50% of the votes) 
with a multiplier of about 1.  In other words, Balinski is going to force each NaziLoon
vote to count about the same as 50 Mainstream votes. 
</p><p>
This is a huge "leverage" or "amplification" factor subject to easy exploitation 
via "strategic voting."  For example, suppose for the purposes of argument that Justin Trudeau
(leader of Canada's Liberal party, recently elected prime minister in 2015) 
is the most popular MP in Canada.  So the Tories might like it considerably if Trudeau's district
were to un-elect him and thus remove him from power.
Tory leadership can easily accomplish that goal.  They simply
tell the Tories in Trudeau's district "we suggest that instead of voting Tory, which is a lost cause,
you vote NaziLoon."  The 50&times; amplification factor then easily carries the day,
and &ndash; voila &ndash; Trudeau is gone.
</p><p>
I call this "targeted killing."
Now the Tories might now want to try that again, selecting as their target some
other important Liberal MP.  If, however, they kept re-using the NaziLoon party as their pawn
in the targeted-killing game, it would no longer work as well. So instead, for their
next "target" the Tories would switch to using the BeerLovers party as the (new) pawn.
And so on.
</p><p>
This would cause all the important leaders in Canada to be "assassinated" &ndash; removed
from political power &ndash; and instead a ragtag random collection of normally unelectable
NaziLoons, BeerLovers, etc  would be all over parliament.
So perhaps the best two-word description of the situation that would be caused
if Balinski's voting system were the design for Canada, would be
"complete devastation."
</p>

<a name="LE"></a>
<h3>The lesser (but probably still unacceptably severe) vulnerability of our system to "targeted killings"</h3>

<p>
With our system, which has <i>additive</i> rather than multiplicative adjustments to votes,
the situation is somewhat less dire than with Balinski.  There will no longer be
a 50&times; amplification factor for NaziLoon votes which could be used to "kill"
any "target."  Instead, the NaziLoons will get a large additive "head start" in vote count
in each district.  Because Trudeau (in our example above)
was postulated to be a very popular Liberal MP, it would
still take a lot of NaziLoon votes to overcome him in his district, and it would be far easier
and much more likely to work, to target an <i>un</i>popular Liberal MP in this way.  
So it would no longer be possible to target essentially anybody.  Only some
targets, usually comparatively unattractive ones, would be easily "hittable."
</p><p>
Nevertheless, even with our system there would be some easily predictable places where easily-determined
strategic voting could be used to hit hard.  These hits would be highly effective and 
also would, as a side effect, distort PR to artificially enrich parliament with fringe candidates.
</p>

<a name="EG"></a>
<h3> Why neither Balinski's nor our systems should be expected to "eliminate gerrymandering" </h3>

<p>
Balinski (judging by his title) seems to hold the view that with his voting method, 
<a href="GerryExec.html">gerrymandering</a> will vanish because it
is no longer useful.  From then on, districts would be drawn sensibly, for a refreshing change!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, <b>we believe Balinski is wrong 
about that.</b>  We think it quite likely, unfortunately,
that gerrymandering would persist
and continue to corrupt the USA massively.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nationwide</i>, we get proportionality, therefore it does not pay
to gerrymander. Agreed.
<i>But locally</i>, gerrymandering pays &ndash; plenty!
</p><P>
Suppose you are Joe Democrat Congressman. You'd like to have a safe
seat. So you get your buddies in the statehouse to draw you a safe
district full of Democrats.
</p><p>
Result (under Balinski voting):  Joe is almost certain to be elected.
The only way Joe can fail to be elected is if the entire country decides
it hates Democrats hugely, and/or Joe's district stops voting Democratic &ndash; both
of which are almost impossible.  (Well, if we ignore the above about "targeted killings.")
</p><p>
So what I predict would happen (with Balinski voting) is this.
The Democrats and Republicans will make interparty deals (just as they already do)
to draw "safe" districts for all their high-ranking members.
As usual, none of them will be defeatable.
</p><p>
But there will also be some districts occupied by lower-ranking Dems and
Repubs, who do not have as much influence with the party bosses, which
will be "at play." Those will be unsafe seats.
So Balinski might improve things, but by no means will eliminate either gerrymandering or
"congressmen for life."
</p><p>
Because of proportionality, the Greens will be able to get elected
too. <!--However they will never be elected from a D- or R-safe district?  NOT SO! -->
There could in principle actually be districts that are safe for
Greens (i.e. essentially guaranteed to elect a Green).
That is because the Greens will (by proportionality) win, say 5% (or whatever)
of congress. The most-Green district in the country
will then be essentially guaranteed to elect a Green, even though it
(say) contains only 10% Greens. 
</p>
<blockquote>
Ivan Ryan comments: 
Locals might be pissed at a third-party which sets up its base
in their district so it can consistently get 5% of the vote &ndash; the
result being that 95% of the residents of the district are represented
by a wacko-fringe party that they don't support.
</blockquote>
<p>
Now the Dems and Repubs could (and probably will?) conspire to hurt the
Greens as follows. Although the Dems and Repubs will be unable to prevent
10% Greens from being elected if the voters are 10% Green, they <i>can</i> keep shifting the Green
district-boundaries with the goal of preventing any Green from being
<i>re</i>elected. 
Or, they could try to make all the districts safe for everybody, so
nobody ever gets defeated. This won't entirely work
(if the country shifts from 60-40 R/D to 40-60, say, then
there will be a 20% change) but it will work in the sense that
all the established party members will be safe everywhere.
Further, if, say, the Dems arrange to make their seatholders all have districts packed
with Democratic voters, we don't see how that will hurt the Democratic party:
<ol type="A">
<li>
Their seatholders will now be safe.
</li><li>
The remaining parts of the country, which contain (say) only 1% Democratic voters
because the gerrymanderers sucked it dry, <i>still</i> will elect Democrats
because of the proportionality guarantee, so the party as a whole is not hurt.
</li></ol>
<p>
So, sorry Balinski &ndash; there is huge incentive to continue to gerrymander.
Indeed, the ultimate limit would be that <i>every</i> district is 100% politically monolithic.
In that case, yes
we'd get proportionality, but every congressman would be a congressman for life
(the opposite of democracy)
and the country would be totally divided+polarized into utterly predictable
red and blue chunks.
</p><p>
Indeed, Balinski throughout his paper about "eliminating gerrymandering in the USA,"
appeared to be completely unfamiliar with the fact that
a large number (probably "most") of the seats in the USA are "bipartisan gerrymandered" and
indeed unaware even of the <i>existence</i> of the <i>concept</i> of
"bipartisan gerrymandering."    And also, with the fact the USA's
districts are drawn, not federally, but rather locally (i.e. state by state).
For next time, I would recommend Balinski acquaint himself with the
basics about an area <i>before</i> he revolutionizes it.

<h3> Would it be  acceptable to use our system merely as a "top up"? 
Yes, and the simple result is "MMP with score voting." </h3>

<p>
The idea would be: first to elect 1 MP per district in an old-fashioned (non-PR) manner,
i.e. with single-winner elections within each district independently. (Preferably the 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>
single-winner voting system would be used, not "first past the post.")
 <i>Then</i>
we would add "<i>top-up</i>" MPs to try to bring the parliament back toward proportionality.
(There would be some pre-specified number W of seats in parliament, of which W-T were
single-MP-in-district seats and the remaining T were top-up seats.)
The number of top-up seats from each party could be obtained using Sainte-Lagu&euml; based on each 
party's vote counts, <i>but</i> now starting the Sainte-Lagu&euml; seat-addition
procedure <i>not</i> from zero initial seat-counts for each party, but rather from the party seat-counts 
arising from the initial W-T "one MP per district" elections. 
</p><blockquote>
<b>Sainte-Lagu&euml; seat-addition procedure:</b>
Let V<sub>j</sub> denote the vote-count for party j, and S<sub>j</sub> denote its current seat count.
Find the party with the greatest V/(2S+1) value.  Give that party one additional seat (incrementing its S).
Keep doing this, one seat at a time, until all the seats in parliament have been
labeled with party-occupancy labels.  
[d'Hondt is the same except that the formula V/(2S+1) is replaced by V/(S+1).]
</blockquote><p>
With each party's deserved-seat count known for the top-up seats, the plan then would be to employ the
linear program here to choose the T top-up MPs optimally while meeting the party-occupancy demands.
This task would, in fact, be <b>trivially simple, i.e, no linear programming would be needed!</b>
That it because we simply would, for a party deserving S more seats, simply elect the S highest-scoring 
as-yet-unelected MPs from that party.  
This essentially would be the (already well known and already used, e.g. in Sweden)
<b>Sainte-Lagu&euml; method of "party lists"</b> but used
as a top-up method, with the list ordering within
each party simply being descending order by average scores received by
their candidates from the voters in their districts. 
</p><blockquote>
If we wanted to impose the additional demand that
no district could have more than one top-up MP, though, <i>then</i> we would need linear programming,
and indeed <i>integer</i> programming.  The latter might be too computationally difficult for feasibility.
Linear programming is computationally efficient.  Integer programming is not and too-large integer programs 
can be infeasible to solve.  (Anyhow quite likely such an integer-programming-based top up would not
even be desirable, if the "targeted killing" threat were considered worse than the problem of
occasionally having districts with several MPs.)
</blockquote><p>
Here is a list of advantages and disadvantages of the resulting system:
</p><ol><li>
Pro: Very simple, well known, method with historical experience of use
(approximates the 
&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation">MMP</a>&quot;
systems currently used in Germany and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>)
with no linear or integer programming needed.
</li><li>
Con: needs explicit use of party names.  "Independent" candidates, therefore, are placed at a severe disadvantage,
or anyhow treated unequally.    It is probably not a good thing if a country, by law, in the 
definition of its voting system itself, disparages or forbids independent thinking.  In the USA during 1970-2015,
approximately 1/3 of voters identified themselves as "Democratic," approximately 1/3 "Republican" and 
approximately 1/3 Independent.  In 2015, Gallup reported that the precise count was
43% Independent, 30% Democrat, 26% Republican:

<br>
At the same time, <a href="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6967">Ipsos</a>
(on behalf of Global News) polled <i>Canadians</i>
about how they would vote (if they could) in
the <i>USA</i> presidential election, finding 55% Democrat, 28% Independent, 17% Republican.
In Hong Kong, the majority of the legislative council consists of independents. 
The Irish Dail (elected via a PR system defined in a way that nowhere mentions "parties")
contained 10% independent MPs during 2011-2015. This contrasts with Poland, which had zero, since
the Polish system basically makes it impossible to be an independent politician.
Many countries over time have experienced a rise in party control, which has
caused a decrease in the numbers of their independent politicians.  In the opinion of many,
this trend has been bad.  So if we were to use the present section's
"proportional representation" party-list top-up system to elect a parliament, 
and if it resulted in fewer than 1% of MPs being independents (duplicating Canada's 2015 situation)
&ndash; then that wouldn't <i>be</i>
"proportional representation." It would be "an enormous distortion of PR."
</li><li>
Think that's unrealistic?
The two most prominent countries using an MMP system to elect their parliaments are Germany
(Bundestag) and New Zealand.  In the German Bundestag's first election in 1949, three
MPs were independents.  In all elections after than (up to 2015) there have been zero.
New Zealand installed its current MMP system in 1996.
The last independent MP elected was Winston Peters (elected in 1993); up to 2015 there have been no others.
It is possible to <b>repair</b> this perceived problem to some extent by 
regarding all the independents as a pseudo-party (the "independents' party").
Of course, many independents are quite dissimilar, so that such an agglomeration could be highly
misleading.  But from the standpoint of just providing an extra boost to independents
versus party candidates to try to repair inherent pro-party unfair biases, 
this repair ought to work pretty well.
</li><li>
Con: it is possible to "game the system" tremendously by switching party affiliations.
To stop that, New Zealand (which uses a top-up system of a similar nature) found it necessary
to enact anti-switching laws making it <i>illegal</i> for politicians to switch parties.
Such laws are not exactly conducive to independent thinking. (I am writing this in 2015.
New Zealand has not had any Independent MPs for over 20 years.)
</li><li>
Con: the top-up MPs are "countrywide" and not "regional," and since some districts will
have more than one MP due to top-ups, that could be viewed as unfair.  It is possible to
<b>repair</b> this perceived problem to some extent by dividing the country into, say, 20 regions,
and electing 1/20 of the parliament from
each region (complete with its own top-ups and own party-lists inside each region).
The regions conduct elections independently using the top-up system we've described (each region contains
many districts inside) and then at the end all the regional subparliaments are merged to obtain
the full countrywide parliament.
</li><li>
Con: In this kind of system, it can be strategic for voters <i>not</i> to vote
for their favorite candidate.  Such votes can be "wasted" and it can be strategically better to lie
so that you can elect a "lesser evil."
<!--
It can be more-strategic for a voter to <i>not vote at all</i> 
than to cast an honest vote, i.e. by voting you make the situation worse in your view??
