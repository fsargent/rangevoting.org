<H2> Nobelist Ken Arrow now endorses <a href="RangeVoting.html">Score Voting</a> </H2>

<p>
This website previously had <a href="ArrowThm.html">said</a>
that "Arrow didn't like range voting" (also known as score voting).
And, unfortunately,
there were various quotes by Arrow and/or his former student
(also a Nobel prize 3-way co-winner!) 
Eric Maskin that we could use to support that claim... some of
them, especially by Maskin, were in my opinion embarrassingly wrong.
[For example, Maskin once contradicted Arrow's statement (1) below.]
</p><p>
However, it gratifyingly appears that Arrow has changed his mind.
This audio interview of Arrow by the Center For Election Science
(you can read our partial text <a href="ArrowTranscript.html">transcript</a>), 
dated 6 October 2012,
was pointed out to me by "omegatron":

In this interview Arrow correctly says that (1) his Impossibility Theorem
doesn't apply to range-voting-type systems, and (2) those provide
more information than ranked systems. He then says (3) he thinks a score
system with "three or four classes" is "<i>probably the best</i>"
single-winner voting method:
</p><blockquote>
<p>
<b>Dr. Arrow:</b>
 Well, I'm a little inclined to think that score systems
where you categorize in maybe three or four classes probably (in spite
of what I said about manipulation) is probably the best. 
</p><p>
So I think Approval Voting is a little too coarse. I think if you had
three or four candidates the incentives for this would be much less if
you had three or four classes.
</p><p>
<b>Dr. Arrow:</b>
I think one of them is the question of more information.
And scoring methods are a way of getting more information.
