RangeVoting.org - Relative Importances of Different Effects on Democracy
</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">

<h2>
Estimated "direct importances" for US democracy (year 2000-2040)
</h2>

<p>
<small>
<b>Abstract.</b>
We try to assess <i>quantitatively</i> how important various possible reforms would be 
(or have been) on
US democracy.   Intuitive guesses are not correct and hence most voting reform effort
has been vastly mis-prioritized.
</small>
</p>
<p>
The following estimates are rather hard to measure, or even define,  precisely.
Nevertheless in order to prioritize voting reform efforts, we must make 
them.   
So here is our current attempt.  
Each importance is on an 0-100 scale where "inventing democracy" has importance 100.
(Click hyperlinks
to reach more detailed discussions of each.)
</p><p>
Note that a lot of the relative importances differ from what might
naively/intuitively have been expected.  That's why,  unfortunately, a lot
of voting reform effort has been / is prioritized wrong.

<b><a href="NPVtrainwreck.html">National Popular Vote</a> 
(replacing/eliminating the Electoral College):</b>
Only three presidential election results
(1876, 1888, and 2000) have been changed due to this, with possible
partial credit to 1824 also (since the notion of "popular vote" was not well-established at that time)
out of 53 presidential elections total (or only 45 if we only count the ones after 1826).
That's a 6.7 percent rate, which is approximately the same rate at which 
<a href="WomenVoting.html">women</a>'s votes change contemporary
US election winners, but exceeds the rate women have changed elections historically.
This is also about half of the rate at which range voting would change election winners.
So I'd give it somewhat more importance than women and about half of
the importance of switching to range voting (e.g. 65&plusmn;35) except that since this
issue only affects presidents not Senate, Governors, or Congressmen, I downgrade by a factor of 3 to
<b>22&plusmn;11</b>.
</p>

<p>&bull;
<a href="WomenVoting.html">Women's suffrage</a>
55&plusmn;18
(based on the percentage of contemporary election results changed by women's votes versus
the number that would be changed by adopting other voting systems;
but am downgrading 55 to <b>43</b> due to fact the USA's "gender gap" currently
exceeds historical norms)
<small>
One could speculate that the evidence indicates the
gender gap is 
increasing with time (and therefore will continue to increase).
I instead went with the intepretation that 
right now we have an atypically large gender gap and hence
it will in future return to lower levels.
This interpretation is (slightly) supported by
the fact the gender gap decreased in 2004 versus in 2000 &ndash;
and also, it cannot keep increasing forever:
There is an upper limit when we reach the "male party" versus the "female party."
If you do not want to worry about these two interpretations, view it this way:
I am using as my estimate, a weighted average of the current gender gap,
and the historical gender gap.    If you want to view it the "increasing trend" way,
then please increase the length of the "women" bar and also its
error-bar.
</small>
</p><p>&bull;
<a href="FraudImport.html">Election Fraud &amp; Manipulation</a>
55 (based on very noisy estimates of the fraction of elections changed;
but am upgrading to <b>68</b> due to incoming new
technological threat from computers,
plus fact US seems at present to have less election fraud than historical norms)
<small>
One can have a similar debate about whether this proves election fraud is decreasing 
or we now are in an atypically fraud-free period...
(And again, manipulation in Ohio 2004 seemed greater than in FL 2000,
thus providing slight evidence for  fraud increasing back toward
historical levels).
Again view it this way:
I am trying to use as my estimate, a weighted average of the current fraud level,
and the historical level.
If you want to view it the "decreasing trend" way,
then please decrease the length of the "fraud" bar.
</small>
</p>
<p>
Brad Friedman points out (in essence) that election fraud can have bad consequences 
<a href="EFraudKenya2007.html">beyond</a> merely changing
the winner.  It can, e.g. trigger a civil war.   
Meanwhile women not having suffrage never triggered a civil war (at least not directly and not yet).
Therefore, election fraud should be upgraded in importance versus stuff like women's suffrage.
I haven't done that because this page is systematically reckoning everything based only on
<i>election-changing</i> "importance," but if you <i>do</i> do that &ndash; and please feel free &ndash;
then I agree with Friedman the fraud bar should
get a lot more importance than shown.  
<i>How much</i> more, and how to measure it, is unclear to me right now.
(Also, if fraud were more severe and common, such as it currently is in some 
<a href="EFraudKenya2007.html">other countries</a>, that too
would raise its importance; but since
this page <a href="RelImport.html">says</a> it is about "US" democracy,
I have not done that.)

<a href="TurnoutBias.html">Turnout biases</a>
&ndash; what if we had universal adult suffrage and made voting compulsory?
<b>61&plusmn;37</b> 
(based on the amount the vote would shift if we had
universal voting in contemporary USA, as compared to known vote shifts due to women voting)
</p><p>&bull;
<a href="GerryImport.html">Gerrymandering</a>
61&plusmn;14
(based on percent of contemporary election-winners changed; but am upgrading to <b>75</b>
due to increasing technology &amp; increased-gerry-frequency threat &amp; 
the unprecedented threat to gerrymander the presidency)
</p><p>&bull;
<a href="BlackVoting.html">Suffrage for Blacks</a>
<b>93</b> (based on fact Blacks currently shift the US vote by about 1.7 times as much as Women
despite their lesser population)
</p><p>&bull;
Plurality vs Improved Voting Systems <b>123&plusmn;15</b>
(<a href="UniqBest.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
measurements indicate changing to <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> would have
comparable importance to invention of democracy;
also historical international presidential-level election
<a href="FunnyElections.html">survey</a> indicates such a switch
would alter about 1 election winner in 8 &ndash; a useful number to keep in mind when comparing
with the effect of women's suffrage etc.)
</p><p>&bull;
Invention of Democracy in the first place: <b>100</b>.  
(All other numbers are rescaled appropriately
to make this one be 100; view this as defining the "metric."
For purposes of Bayesian Regret comparisons, am regarding "invention of democracy" as
the replacement of "random winner" by "strategic plurality voting.")
</p>

<h3> Methodology and Definitions </h3>

<p>
<b>Democratic</b> vaguely means "all people getting what they want."
I don't have a precise definition.
I suppose the best available measure
of "getting what they want" is "<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>."   
I suppose that women-voting, blacks-voting, no-gerrymandering, better-voting-systems,
no-fraud, and universal-voting, all are democracy-<i>improving</i> moves.
But if, say, you oddly considered gerrymandering to be <i>more</i> democratic, then
my estimate would still be as valid about its unsigned magnitude...
and if you considered gerrymandering to be neither more nor less
democratic then my estimate would be a valid <i>upper bound</i>.
</p><p>
Abd Lomax suggests that turnout bias is really a form of range voting (e.g. people
who voluntarily  wish to have less impact on the vote can with range voting use a subrange;
and with non-compulsory voting could fail to vote).   Having only highly motivated people
vote in some sense "weights" votes according to motivation, garnering more information
from voters, and hence some
turnout biases might actually be viewed as <i>more</i> democratic.  
That argument
seems to disappear if the voting-form <i>is</i> 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, however.
</p><p>
One also <a href="TurnoutPhilos.html">might argue</a> that perhaps having
more-educated or older people vote more, might be better
from a utilitarian standpoint, even if it is less "democratic."
(Or you could counter-argue that the vote of a <i>younger</i> 
person is more important since they have more life
yet to live and be affected by their vote...)
</p><p>
<b>My working method</b> is ad hoc and not terribly supportable.  I'm acting like
an Ancient Roman engineer making arithmetic
estimates and using them to design a catapult
&ndash; but working in ignorance of
Newton's laws of physics.   
So basically, I assume without real justification that if X changes F times
as many election-winners as Y, then X is F times more "important."
(I try to do this for the
contemporary US situation but with some extrapolation into the future.) 
Also if X leads to a vote-percentage additive-shift (also in contemporary US political climate) 
F times larger than Y, same conclusion.   Finally if X leads in computer simulations to
a Bayesian-regret additive change F times larger than Y, same conclusion.
This methodology may actually be self-contradictory.
But it is probably ok
for "small perturbation" effects because "everything is linear locally"
&ndash; the trouble is that some of our perturbations seem <i>not</i> small.
(On the other hand &ndash; arguably they all <a href="#smallness">are</a> small.)
</p><p>
In view of all that and the rather large error bars on some of our estimates, they
are not exactly to be regarded as the Pythagorean Theorem.
(Also, some of the errors are highly-correlated so the "error bar" graphic is 
in that sense misleading, or at least not giving you the full picture.)
Still, it is essential to make these estimates as best we can.
</p>

<a name="#smallness"></a>
<h3> Somewhat-speculative "smallness" justification for  methodology </h3>
<p>
At first I thought this methodology lay far away 
from anything really  justifiable in any rigorous
mathematical sense.
</p><p>
But later I saw that 
there <i>is</i> a way to try for such a justification, and it might actually work.
</p><p>
It is a fact that smooth surfaces, analytic dynamical systems, etc, all
are "locally linear" almost everywhere (or everywhere).
In other words,
for <i>small</i>-enough perturbations, it is irrelevant how you
measure them &ndash; 
F-times-as-big perturbations according to metric #1, are automatically
F times as big according to metric #2.
(E.g, for readers who know differential geometry: it does not matter what coordinate
system you use on a manifold.   If you are at a nonsingular point measuring
<i>small</i> perturbations,
then every smooth coordinate system will agree that an F-times-larger change 
is an F-times-larger change.)
</p><p>
The key word is "small."  
Now one might imagine that a perturbation which has  comparable effect to the
entire invention of democracy, is not a "small perturbation"!
But think again.   Blacks are only 11% of the US voting population.  That's pretty small.
Yet they exert an effect comparable to the invention of democracy.
In turn, arguably the entire invention of democracy is a small perturbation 
to the world-human-interactions dynamical system.
Why?  Well, consider, say, Pakistan versus the USA.  About 300 years ago, they
were economically comparable.
But as of 2002, Pakistan had GDP per capita $1940 (PPP-dollar), versus the USA's $36400,
which is 19 times smaller.
Assume this difference was due to the USA being a democracy for most of that time, while 
Pakistan wasn't.
(This oversimplifies greatly, but will suffice for our purposes.)
In that case, the USA gained its large comparative wealth as a result of
an annual exponential growth rate 1.01 times larger than Pakistan's.
<i>The point</i> is that 1.01 is a small perturbation away from 1.
History has shown that democracy is not beneficial if it only lasts a few years.
Only over long time spans, where small advantages are allowed to compound exponentially,
do we see the advantages of democracy for improving the human condition.
So with that view, <i>all</i> of this stuff is a "small perturbation." 
To the extent that view is valid, our methodology (at least assuming we
lie at a generic point...) is well justified.

<h3> A different way to make our "importances" have a mathematically rigorous meaning
(suggested by Professor S.J.Brams) </h3>

<p>
Several political scientists in the 1970s devised mathematical definitions
of "voting power."
For example, consider a two-way vote among three voters A, B, C
who have 5, 8, and 11
votes, respectively.  Although one might naively imagine their
voting powers differ, in fact all three have <i>exactly equal</i> voting power.
(All three players are equivalent in terms of their effect on the election-outcome:
if any two vote the same way, they win.)
The usual definition is to consider every possible vote-configuration
(there are 8 configurations with 3 players) and if your vote <i>alters the winner</i> in
a fraction F of those configurations, you have "voting power F."
This definition is flawed if some configurations are more likely than others.
(For example, if we happened to know that A's and B's votes are not independent
coin-tosses &ndash; instead A always votes the same way as B &ndash;
then C would have <i>zero</i> voting power.)
To overcome that objection
we really should define a player's voting power to be 
the <i>probability</i> a player's
vote will alter the election outcome, using whatever probability distribution 
happens in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Then our methodology 
can be regarded as an attempt to assess the "power" of different changes 
(such as "women's suffrage") to democracy:
a change has F times more "importance" if it alters F times more election-winners.
</p>

<p>
Viewed in this sense, our "importance" is really just "voting power" &ndash;
a notion well-accepted by political scientists &ndash; merely applied
in a new domain.
</p>

<p>
If either Brams' or the "smallness" interpretation are accepted then
it becomes possible to measure all these importances to a few percent accuracy
if enough work (gathering data) is put into the effort. 
We've acted here as though both are correct.
But it would also be possible to drop the smallness assumption.
(I think that would result in the "invention of democracy" rising in importance
but think nothing else would change much.)
And then there is no 
longer any question about the legitimacy or lack-of-clear-meaning of these estimates.
</p>

<h3> Non-intuitive conclusions </h3>

<p>&bull;
You might have thought women's suffrage had to be more important than blacks voting 
since there are
far more women.   
Wrong: blacks vote very differently than whites, whereas women vote highly similarly to men, 
causing blacks to have a <i>clearly larger</i> vote-shifting effect.
</p><p>&bull;
You might have thought blacks with only 
11% of the voting population (about 13% of total population)
could not possibly be nearly as important as the whole invention of democracy.
Wrong:
due to their very-one-way voting in contemporary USA,
if we got rid of the blacks, the USA would actually have solid one-party rule
and pretty much wouldn't <i>be</i>
a democracy. 
<blockquote>
This in fact happened in the "Jim Crow" South during the 1900-1970
era, especially about 1915-1950; they had near-total Democratic party domination.
<small>
If the "South" means the 11
former confederacy states
AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA, then
during 1919-1948 there were 114 governor elections in these states and
the Democrats won 113. The sole exception
was 1920 TN, won by Alfred Taylor[R], by the smallest margin of
any TN election during this period and during the Harding
Republican-landslide.</small>
</blockquote>
So within the constraints of our "direct effect" methodology,
this non-intuitive conclusion seems justified.  
<small>
Incidentally, here a reader might object that, if the Blacks vanished, then we 
might <i>initially</i> get
1-party rule, but eventually the voters would tire of that and a competing party would 
arise and we'd settle back into 2-party rule.  That might indeed be true.
But that, if so, would be a <i>secondary</i> effect, i.e. not an effect caused by just
one election, but rather caused by a sequence of many elections.  We on this page
are only talking about "direct" effects on democracy.
</small>
This in fact is not (as I initially worried)
a "failure" of my methodology; it is a very reassuring "success."
<small>
As a further sanity-check &ndash; which I haven't done &ndash; one could
<i>directly</i> examine what fraction of winners are altered
by Black votes by using exit polls.
</small>
</p><p>&bull;
Women's suffrage got far more reform effort, protest marches, etc, etc 
devoted to it than abolishing gerrymandering.  But at least in the contemporary USA,
gerrymandering is fairly-clearly more important.  (It would be good to get
more data to reduce the error bar for gerrymandering to make that even clearer.)
And switching to range voting is even <i>more</i> important still, even though
it unfortunately has gotten far less attention from reformers.
</p><p>&bull;
It is again counterintuitive that the switch to range voting could be somewhat
<i>more</i> important than inventing democracy.  But if "inventing democracy" means
switching from "random winner" (or something better than random-winner)
to "strategic <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-voting
winner" then that is what a vast number
of Bayesian Regret measurements say (and this is robust across a great many
models...).
