RangeVoting.org - The resistance of Average- and Median-based range voting to "1-sided strategy"
</title>

<h2> 
Median-based range voting is "twice as resistant to 1-sided strategy" as average-based
</h2>

<p>
Jameson Quinn suggested the following 
1-parameter model about "one-sided strategy" in voting.
Warren D. Smith then
(April 2011)
worked out the consequences of Quinn's model in closed form,
finding a surprisingly elegantly simple result.
</p><p>
<small>We had previously 
<a href="MedianVrange.html#side1">examined</a> only the special 
("unbiased," "honestly close election") case P=0 
of this model.
That special case turns out to behave unlike the P&gt;0 cases.
When P&gt;0 we here argue median-based range voting is "twice as resistant to 1-sided strategy"
as average-based.
But when P=0 we previously had argued average-based range voting looked to have
better resistance to 1-sided strategy than median-based!
(Obviously, the P=0 special case is the most important point of this parameter space,
but it seems dubious it should outweigh the whole rest of it.)
</small>
</p><p>
<b>The model:</b>
Two candidates named "Gore" and "Bush."
Large number of voters.
Initially, each voter has honest score for each candidate that is an independent
random-uniform real number in the real interval
[0,1].   <i>But</i> now <i>reverse</i> a fraction P
of the Bush&gt;Gore votes, by applying the map x&rarr;1-x to its scores x.
The result is a set of "honest" votes which, in net, favor Gore.
These votes are described by a single parameter P with 0&le;P&le;1;
the greater P is, the more pro-Gore the voters honestly are.
</p><p>
That situation will be our starting point.  It has 100% honest voting.
We will now consider the effect of pro-Bush 1-sided strategy.
</p><p>
This model implies there are a fraction (1-P)/2 Bush&gt;Gore, 
and (1+P)/2 Gore&gt;Bush, 
honest voters.
The Gore&gt;Bush voters have a triangular probability density of Gore scores:
ProbDensity(x)=2x, with mean score 2/3 for Gore and mean=1/3 for Bush.
The Bush&gt;Gore voters have the same triangular probability density of Bush scores
and mean score 2/3 for Bush and mean=1/3 for Gore.
</p><p>
Now suppose a fraction F, 0&le;F&le;1, of the Bush&gt;Gore 
voters <b>strategically exaggerate</b> to
Bush=1, Gore=0.  We'll assume there is no counterstrategy by the
Gore&gt;Bush voters &ndash; they just stay honest.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>THEOREM:</u></b>
In the above model with any P with 0&lt;P&lt;1, Gore wins with honest voting;
but Bush wins with 1-sided exaggeration exactly when the fraction F of Bush&gt;Gore voters
who exaggerate obeys F&gt;P/(1-P)  for average-based <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>
voting, and F&gt;2P/(1-P) for
median-based range voting.  If P&gt;1/2 and P&gt;1/3 respectively, then
Gore wins despite any amount of pro-Bush exaggeration.
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> voting (since it 'forces exaggeration') is entirely
immune to 1-sided strategy, i.e. with it Gore wins, period.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>PROOF:</u></b>
We first shall derive <b>formulas</b> for Bush &amp; Gore's post-exaggeration
median and average scores.  (The pre-exaggeration  results also will arise
from our same formulas  by taking F=0.)
Note that there are three kinds A,B,C of voters, present in proportions
</p><center>
     (1-P)F/2 : (1-F)(1-P)/2 : (1+P)/2     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; [which sum to 1],
</center><p>
who respectively rate  Gore=0, Gore=honest, and Gore=honest. 
The type B&cup;C voters (combined set) have a trapezoidal probability density of scores
with the two trapezoid leg-heights being (1-F)(1-P) and (1+P),
up to a constant multiplicative 
scaling factor you need to choose to make the total probability-mass be 1, i.e. "normalized,"
at the Gore=0 and Gore=1 sides respectively.
Gore's <b>median</b> score is then <i>m</i> where
</p><center>
(1-P)F/2 + (1-[1-P]F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;m</sub>[(1-F)(1-P)+(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)(1-P)+(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
= 
1/2.
</center>
<!-- 
(1-P)*F/2 + (1-(1-P)*F/2) * int( ((1-F)*(1-P)+(2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..m) /
 int( ((1-F)*(1-P)+(2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..1 );
-->
<p>
This simplifies to
</p><center>
(P+[1-P]F/2)m<sup>2</sup>
+ (1-F)(1-P)m
+ (1-P)F/2
= 1/2
</center><p>
a quadratic equation whose solution m is
</p><center>
<b>GoreMedian</b>
= 
([F-1][1-P] + ([P+F]P+1-F)<sup>1/2</sup>) / ([1-P]F+2P).
</center></p>
Similarly Bush's median score is computed by noting the type-A,B,C
voters rate Bush=1, Bush=honest, and Bush=honest.
The type B&cup;C voters (combined set) have a trapezoidal probability density of scores
with the two trapezoid leg-heights being  (1+P)  and  (1-F)(1-P) 
(up to a constant multiplicative normalization factor)
at the Bush=0 and Bush=1 sides respectively.  We find analogously
</p><center>
0 + (1-[1-P]F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;m</sub>[(1+P)-(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1+P)-(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
= 
1/2.
</center>
<!-- 
0 + (1-(1-P)*F/2) * int( (1+P - (2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..m) /
 int( (1+P - (2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..1 );
-->
<p>
This simplifies to
</p><center>
- ([1-P]F/2+P)m<sup>2</sup>
+ (1+P)m
= 1/2
</center><p>
a quadratic equation with solution
</p><center>
<b>BushMedian</B>
= 
([1+P] - ([P+F]P+1-F)<sup>1/2</sup>) / ([1-P]F+2P).
</center>
</p>
Meanwhile, Gore's <b>average</b> score is
</p><center>
  0 + (1-[1-P]F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)(1-P)+(2P+[1-P]F)x]xdx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)(1-P)+(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
</center>
<!-- 
0 + (1-(1-P)*F/2) * int( ((1-F)*(1-P)+(2*P+(1-P)*F)*x)*x, x=0..1) /
 int( ((1-F)*(1-P)+(2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..1 );
-->
<p>
(note the integrals in the denominators
are there merely to provide the right normalization-constant
for the trapezoidal probability density).  This simplifies to
</p><center>
<b>GoreAverage</b> =  1/2 - (1-P)F/6 + P/6 = (3+P+F-FP)/6.
</center><p>
Finally, Bush's average score is
</p><center>
(1-P)F/2 + (1-[1-P]F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1+P)-(2P+[1-P]F)x]xdx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1+P)-(2P+[1-P]F)x]dx
</center>
<!-- 
(1-P)*F/2 + (1-(1-P)*F/2) * int( (1+P - (2*P+(1-P)*F)*x)*x, x=0..1) /
 int( (1+P - (2*P+(1-P)*F)*x), x=0..1 );
-->
<p>
which simplifies to
</p><center>
<b>BushAverage</b> = (3-P+F-FP)/6
</center><p>
Now we ask: <b>what fraction F of Bush&gt;Gore voters need to exaggerate in order
to make Bush win?</b>
With <b>averages</b>, the answer is got by solving BushAverage=GoreAverage for F, with the 
very simple result
<!--
solve( 3-P+F-F*P = 3 + P + F*P - F, F );
-->
</p><center>
F<sub>ExaggNeeded(Avg)</sub> = P / (1-P).
</center><p>
Note that if P&gt;1/2 then 
average-based range voting becomes <i>immune</i> to strategy:
no amount of exaggeration will
suffice to make Bush win.
I.e. this model yields such immunity when
the honest ratio of Gore&gt;Bush to Bush&gt;Gore voters exceeds 3:1.
</p><p>
With <b>medians</b>, the answer is got by solving BushMedian=GoreMedian for F, with the 
amazingly simple result
<!--
solve( 
((1+P) - ((P+F)*P+1-F)^(1/2)) / ((1-P)*F+2*P)
=
((F-1)*(1-P) + ((P+F)*P+1-F)^(1/2)) / ((1-P)*F+2*P),
F );
-->
</p><center>
F<sub>ExaggNeeded(Med)</sub> = 2P / (1-P).
</center><p>
Note that median-based range is thus <b>exactly twice as resistant</B> to 1-sided strategy as
average-based range, in this model, in the sense that exactly twice as many exaggerators
are needed to make Bush win (<i>regardless</i> of P for 0&lt;P&lt;1).
</p><p>
Median-based range voting becomes immune to strategy in this model when 
P&gt;1/3, i.e. when the honest ratio of Gore&gt;Bush to Bush&gt;Gore voters exceeds 2:1.
</p><p>
Finally, for approval voting, the votes are "already exaggerated" 
to the endpoints of the allowed score range, so further exaggeration has no effect.
Hence if Gore wins, he wins.

<!--
Now if we solve the "crossover" equation
</p><center>
 GoreMedian = GoreAverage
</center><p>
i.e. solve
</p>
--
( (F-1)*(1-P) + ((P+F)*P+1-F)^(1/2) ) / ((1-P)*F+2*P) = (3+P+F*P-F)/6
--
<center>
([F-1][1-P] + ([P+F]P+1-F)<sup>1/2</sup>) / ([1-P]F+2P) = (3+P-F+FP)/6
-- 
P=0.0:     F=0.464
P=0.05:    F=0.612
P=0.1:     F=0.751
P=0.15:    F=0.895
P=0.1848:  F=1.00002
P=0.2:     F=1.048 oops
--
</center><p>
for F, we find that there is only one real solution with 0&le;F&le;1,
which grows from F<sub>cross</sub>&asymp;0.4641
when P=0 up toward 
F<sub>cross</sub>=1 when P&asymp;0.1848, and then stops existing.
</p>
In other words,
median is less distorted than average when 0&lt;F&lt;F<sub>cross</sub>
but average is less distorted when F<sub>cross</sub>&lt;F&le;1.
The two are equally affected when either F=0 or F=F<sub>cross</sub>.
If P&ge;0.1848 then 
F<sub>cross</sub> does not exist, in which case median is always
less distorted by 1-sided strategy, than average.
