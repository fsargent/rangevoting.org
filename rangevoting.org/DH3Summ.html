<H2> The DH3 "Dark Horse plus 3 rivals" pathology (Executive summary)</H2>


<ol>
<li>
Many voting system "pathologies" or "paradoxes" or "bad behaviors"
have been noticed over the years.
The most damaging ones are those that occur <i>often</i>
and  which lead to very <i>serious</i> problems such as election of
the winner unanimously agreed to be <i>worst</i>.
</li>
<li>
The DH3 pathology is horribly (near-maximally) common and horribly (maximally in the 
4-candidate case) severe: It occurs whenever there are 3 strong contenders and 1 or more unliked
"dark horse" candidates.  In the 4-candidate case it assures the worst candidate wins.
</li>
<li>
It devastates both the Borda voting system and  all(?) Condorcet systems
based on full rank orderings as votes.
</li>
<li>
This illustrates the extremely severe reaction 
("anaphylactic shock") of these systems to "strategic voters."
</li>
<li>
But range voting reacts only mildly to strategic voters.
In the DH3
scenario, Range has no problem and just elects the best winner.
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is DH3?</b>
Put briefly: let the 3 main contenders be A,B,C.
The A-voters artificially downgrade the main rivals B,C by raising the dark horses "above" them,
and the B- and C-supporters act similarly.  (Voters who do not act-thus-strategically are
ineffectual, having tiny relative effect compared to the vastly-more-powerful strategic voters.)
As a result (in vulnerable voting systems)
a dark horse wins.
