The idea is by <i>paying</i> to cast your score voting ballot according to
certain carefully designed price formulas, you will become inspired by the
profit motive to vote honestly. Unfortunately this disregards some massive
real world problems, but perhaps might be ok in some corporate votes and also
(if the whole max-profit-motive-theorem is abandoned instead merely
seeking to discourage exaggeration in range voting)
as modified by us even perhaps in governmental ones.
