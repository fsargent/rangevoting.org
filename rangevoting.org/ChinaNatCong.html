China's
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_People%27s_Congress">National People's 
Congress</a> (NPC)
&ndash; the largest Parliament body in the world &ndash;
has been elected via, essentially, <b><a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> Voting</b>
since 1979.
[With some slight modifications, most importantly that you need more than 50%
positive scores to win a seat; if not enough seats 
obey that, they are left unfilled, see Leung below re article 41.]
</p><p>
We first shall explain the electoral method set out in China's constitution
and electoral laws.  Unfortunately, it appears that during 1954-2018 
China never actually worked quite the way its constitution and laws said.
We'll then explain what we call the "shadow model" of
what is really going on in China.  Almost every official government body in
China has a near-duplicate "shadow" body, usually more secretive and
with somewhat smaller size, inside the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  
The shadow model postulates that these
shadow bodies make the important decisions, then "recommend" them to the official
bodies, which then almost always agree.  The CCP is the real power
and hence effectively the real government, 
at least as far as the most important decisions are concerned.
</p><p>
If so, then what matters is the methods used to choose the memberships
of all those shadow bodies, which are, according to the CCP's own constitution,
also elected by a near-duplicate of the official system, except that the base-voters
are "CCP members" (currently about 7% of China's adult population) rather than "everybody
aged&ge;18."  We are not completely sure, but our guess is: essentially
the same approval-voting system is used within the CCP.
</p><p>
However, it is widely believed that during 1954-2018 the CCP <i>also</i>
never actually worked quite the way its constitution and internal rules said!
The decision-making theoretically is supposed to be
"bottom up," i.e. the CCP, like the official government, is hierarchical
with the more-populous layers electing the less-populous layers above them.
However, there in reality appears to be a lot of "top down" decision making too
where the High layer instructs the Lower layer how to vote instead of
the Lower layer deciding that all by itself.  According to the CCP rules
that is never supposed to happen, and anybody who does it is supposed to be
disciplined.  In some cases that disciplining has been severe,
such as life imprisonment.  
</p><p>
What really happens in China?  How does the system really work?
As far as I can tell, few or no people know.
Most or all professional China Experts outside of China do not know.
I believe the vast majority of Chinese citizens do not know.   And nor do I.
Many think that there  has been a gradual trend during 1954-2018 
causing China and the CCP
to work more like the way its constitutions and laws say,
but if so, that trend has not come anywhere near completion.

<a name="TheRules"></a>
<h3> China's rules </h3>
<p>
Here is a quote from an English translation of some 
<a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2015-08/31/content_1945577.htm">rules</a>
(see especially rule 2C):
</p><blockquote>
"2. How are the deputies elected?
</p><ol type="A"><li>
 The People's Congress system in China has several levels: 
county- and township-level; provincial- and municipal level; and the
national level. Eligible voters elect county and township-level
congresses only. The other levels are elected by deputies at the level
immediately below theirs.
</li><li>
 The election committee publishes a list of candidate deputies 20
days before an election. Sometimes there are discussions or
preliminary elections. After that, officials release a final list of
the candidates 5 days before the election.
</li><li>
 Then it's time to vote. Voters may cast ballots <b>for</b> or <b>against</b>
candidates, or <b>abstain</b> from voting.  They also have the option of
voting for people who are not on the official ballot.
</li><li>
<b>Successful candidates must receive more than half the votes.</b> If the
number of successful candidates exceeds the number of vacancies, <b>those
with more votes are elected.</b>"
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is confirmed in Kwan-kwok Leung:
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ny0FT_qjYSkC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=Kwan-kwok+Leung+elections&source=bl&ots=czc5mwx1ew&sig=ADK0dsmvpvdLDmlPBftE4tsqSa0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwterUz9_ZAhUGpFkKHSgVDqQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Kwan-kwok%20Leung%20elections&f=false#v=onepage&q=Kwan-kwok Leung elections&f=false">The Basic-level Elections in Guangzhou since 1979</a> (1996, but I have changed his article-numbers to conform to our
more recent 2018 <a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">copy</a> of China's election law):
<blockquote>
A voter may cast an affirmative or negative ballot for a candidate, may vote for
any other eligible voters and may also abstain from voting (article 37 of
the 1979 election 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">law</a>).  
Candidates are considered elected if
they have obtained more than half the votes in the election districts.
When the number of [elected] candidates falls below the designated number of [seats],
a supplementary election will be held to fill the remaining seats,
[this time using a threshold of 1/3 instead of 1/2] (article 41 of
the 1979 election 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">law</a>).
</blockquote>
<p>
If they cannot attain 1/3, then, apparently, the seat really is left unfilled.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol><li>
"All citizens of the People's Republic of China who have
reached the age of 18 have the right to vote and stand for election, 
regardless of ethnic background, race, sex, occupation, family background, 
religious belief, education level, property status or length of residence. 
[But] people who have been deprived of their political rights according to law 
do not have the right to vote and stand for election."
</li><li>
The lowest-level Deputies are elected directly by their constituencies.
</li><li>
"In both direct and indirect elections, the number of candidates must 
exceed the number of vacancies by 33% to 100% for direct, and 20-50% for indirect
elections."  (Article 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">30</a>.)
</li><li>
"In a direct election, more than half of the eligible voters in the 
election district must vote in order for the election to be valid."
</li><li>
A voter who is absent from his electoral district during the time of an election may, 
with the approval of the election committee and by written authorization, 
entrust another voter with a proxy vote. A voter shall not stand proxy for more than three persons.
(Article 38 of the 1979 election 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">law</a>,
quoted verbatim.)
</li><li>
The lowest-level elections are supposed to be done by secret ballot
(Articles 36 &amp; 46
of the 1979 election 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">law</a>)
and on a day that "does not interfere with production," which usually means Sunday.

Electoral districts at the basic level (townships, towns, etc.) are composed of 
200-300 voters but sometimes up to 1000, while larger levels (counties, etc.) 
are composed of 2000-5000 voters.

</li><li>
The congress is made up of 2900-3000 delegates (as of year 2018),
elected by China's provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the armed forces. 
Delegates hold office for five years, and the full congress is convened for one session 
each year.
</li><li>
The three NPCs during 1979-1994 made 251 laws, an average of 84 per
congress or 17 per year.
</li><li>
The bulk of the NPC's power  lies within a 
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee_of_the_National_People%27s_Congress">standing committee</a></b> 
of 150-175 members 
elected from congress delegates. It meets every couple of months.
(The full congress meets too rarely and is too large and hence unwieldy to do much.)
</li><li>
It's illegal for Chinese citizens to form their own political parties, so 
they must choose between the 9 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_China">parties</a>
the Chinese government offers them (which are the same 9 that were set up 
at the founding of the PRC in 1949).
In 2012-2013, the result 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China#Electoral_history#Electoral_history">was</a>
that the NPC consisted of 2157 members of
the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China">Communist Party of China</a>
and 830 either from the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_(People%27s_Republic_of_China)">
United Front</a>
of other parties, or partyless candidates (if any); together amounting to 2987.
</li><li>
On the 2196 NPC members in year 2000, supposedly 128
were not members of any party, 68 were members of non-CCP parties,
71 were army generals, 118 were artists, 107 college presidents,
142 academics, and 49 corporate.
</li><li>
In the 19th congress (2280 delegates) 24% were 
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41652487">women</a>.  
A membership list (published by the Chinese government in 2017)
of the Standing Committee elected in 2013
included 150 people.
Their birthdates ranged from 1945 to 1968.
25 of them (16.7%) women.
46 were not Communist Party members.
</li></ol>
<p>
The NPC supposedly is the supreme organ of power in China,
the world's most populous country. The responsibilities of the NPC include:
<ol><li>
Amending the constitution and overseeing its enforcement.
</li><li>
Enacting and amending basic laws governing criminal offenses, 
civil affairs, state organs, and other matters.
</li><li>
Electing and appointing members to central state organs, including the 
chairman, vice chairmen, secretary-general, and other 
members of the NPC Standing Committee; and also 
the President and Vice-President.  Theoretically they also can remove
any or all of these.
</li><li>
In addition to the <i>national</i> 
people's congress, there also are many
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China#Local_People's_Congresses#Local_People's_Congresses">
local</a>
people's congresses.
People's Congresses of cities that are not divided into districts, counties, 
city districts, towns, townships, and lastly "ethnic townships," are directly elected.
<!--Article 97 of the Constitution of China-->
Village committee members and chairpersons are directly elected.
<!--Article 111 and Niou 2011, p.3.-->
Local People's Congresses have the constitutional authority to recall the heads and 
deputy heads of government at the provincial level and below.
</li></ol>

<a name="NonDemoc"></a>
<h3>China as a giant fake democracy</h3>
<p>
Despite those official powers, the NPC is largely symbolic, often described as a
"rubber stamp" or "fig leaf," because its members usually
are unwilling to challenge leadership. Therefore, true power lies
with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.  
It is they who ultimately set policy.
Nevertheless there have been historical occasions when dissenting voices 
in the NPC have forced goal and policy reconsideration.
</p><p>
On various occasions in world history, there have been giant fake democracies.
Indeed, fake democracies have been very common.
The laws proving they are great democracies are written on paper for all to
see.   The countries involved can be small or enormous.  But the reality is different.
For example, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">USSR</a>
&ndash; Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 1922-1991,
which some during Stalin's rule even lauded (based on an examination of its 1936
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Soviet_Constitution">constitution</a>) 
as "the most democratic country on earth."
In the USA during about 1900-1950, the laws were all very fine, but
on the ground was the reality of "Jim Crow" oppression of black people,
especially in the South. 
Any extraterrestrial reading these laws probably would not
have suspected the truth.
</p><img src="WinniePooh.jpg" align="right" width="30%"><p>
There are a number of clues enabling you to deduce
that the "Great Chinese People's Democracy" in
reality is quite different from the one explained in their laws.
First of all, in order for a nationwide Democracy on China's enormous scale
to <i>work</i>, the voters need to know what their Congress-members are doing, and 
there need to be all sorts of critical voices and analysis of that,
available in a <i>free press.</i>  That free press also needs to provide similar
consideration of all the rival <i>candidates</i> for office.
Well, China as of 2018 simply does not have a free press.  It
instead has by far the largest 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China">censorship</a>
operation the world has ever seen,
with millions of full time employees and sophisticated software
censoring all information generated by the entire world.
</p><p>
Indeed, Xi Jinping just amended the constitution to abolish his 2-term limit
to permit him to remain in charge for the rest of his life &ndash; plus
(rather absurdly) 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/asia/china-censorship-xi-jinping.html">banned</a>
the use of the English letter "N" and the children's cartoon bear "Winnie the Pooh"
on the Chinese internet, apparently
because those were felt somehow to be associated with dissent
against that!
</p><p>
The fact that, according to article 31
of the 1982 election 
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">law</a>,
"the list of candidates shall be made public <i>five</i> days before the election"
is not exactly inspiring.  You immediately can conclude from that that any prolonged
press analysis/investigation of the different candidates, would be impossible
even with a fully free press.
</p><p>
What about international election-monitoring groups?
<a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/06/economist-explains-3">
The Economist</a> says
"Russia and China have set up pseudo-monitors, such as
those from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Russian-sponsored
organisation based in Minsk, and the Beijing-based Shanghai
Co-operation Organisation. These groups happily endorse fraudulent
elections, muddying the waters to undermine the efforts of more
reputable bodies."
</p><p>
Further, even if everything operated as advertised, 
the multilevel structure of the NPC seems assured to yield communist
party domination at the top levels.  Let us make an analogy.
Natural uranium is 0.78% U-235. If uranium atoms are put through a sequence of
processes, each of which makes it 5% more likely to pass a U-235 atom,
then after 100 such stages we get very pure "weapons grade" U-235.
If at the lowest levels the Communist Party was the largest sub-faction
within the NPC, "enrichment"
would be expected to occur each level to yield much higher Communist fraction at
the top level.
</p><p>
On the other hand Brown 2011 seems to suspect, or hope, that the Organic Law
of village elections has indeed genuinely yielded local
democracy in at least 10% of China's &asymp;800,000 villages.
He thinks they have genuinely been "one person, one vote," secret ballot,
with more candidates than seats, with public announcements of results
and pre-election campaigning.  And most importantly to Brown,
the winners have at least sometimes not been Communist Party members.
On pp.120-125 of
Diamond &amp; Myers 2001 we find
"In how many of China's one million villages have democratic elections
taken place? Estimates vary widely, as do definitions of 'democratic.'..."
They then mention claims/estimates ranging from &lt;10% to 60% by various foreign &amp; domestic
sources.  
(It seems probable that even China's leaders do not know this answer.)
They then say they did their own estimate in 1997 by opportunistic
interviews with 8302 random Chinese people in 478 villages in 7
provinces, finding an estimate that 82 of the 478 had democratic
(according to the authors's standards of "democratic," which sound reasonable to me)
elections (i.e. 17%), but then finally gave reasons to suspect
this 17% probably was an overestimate nationwide.
</p><p>
Any abrupt dismissal of China's constitution leaves unanswered the question of
what <i>really</i> is going on.  For example, if the Communist Party 
really is calling all the shots, perhaps including rigging all the NPC elections &ndash;
then what is <i>their</i> decision-making process?
It simply is not possible for Xi Jinping by himself to make the vast number
of decisions needed, at least if he wants there to be any quality in those decisions.
So clearly <i>some</i> sort of collective decision-making process is employed.
Whatever it is, is shrouded in mystery.
</p><blockquote>
As of 2018, approximately 7% of China's population (i.e. perhaps 85 million)
are Communist Party members.
To join, there is an application process involving writing an essay and interviews.
They have meetings. They pay membership dues.  There is a "youth division" too.
They have their own universities apparently not accessible by non-party members.
There is a major nationwide party meeting every 5 years.
The "central committee" of the party has about 204 members plus 164 part-time
or alternate members, and holds most of the power.  They have regional
responsibilities. Within that, the "politburo" has 25 members 
(of whom, up to 2018, none have ever been female)
and within that is the "standing committee" with 9, with the leaders
of China apparently always being in that 9.
What do they do, how do they decide to do it, and how are their members determined? 
I do not know.
Crucially, the Central Military Commission in charge of the armed forces,
is a subset of the Communist Party; and similarly for the bodies
in charge of intelligence, security, and police.
</p><p>
The Chinese government as a whole is enormous, with 29 ministries employing
about 30 million civil servants in all.  The heads of these ministries are usually,
but not always, Communist Party members.
</blockquote>
<p>
And is the NPC, all 3000 of them, really just there for show?
Or do they actually do something useful?  And if they do, surely it is desired that they
do it well?

<h3>Historical note: democracy in China before the Communist  takeover</h3>
<p>
Some democracy existed during 1900-1947 before the Communists took over in Oct. 1949,
although China as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_government">whole</a>
was not a democracy.
By 1907, everybody resident in Shanghai for at least 5 years was entitled to vote.
In 1911 there were 500 newspapers in China with readership 42 million
(about 10% of the total population at that time).
In 1912 the National Assembly and House were elected by 40 million voters.
Some provinces like Hunan and Zhejiang introduced voting rights in
the 1910s and 1920s.  
Provincial elections in 1918 involved 36 million voters.
Village elections began in 1929 (the Communists only re-introduced them in 1979).
What would have happened to Chinese democracy if the Communists had lost
the civil war, is unknown.
</p>
<a name="HowLong"></a>
<h3>How long has China been doing this?</h3>
<p>
I claim the NPC's approval voting system
started in 1979.
Red China began operating in 1949.
<!--
It must have started sometime in [1953, 1979].
The
"Rules of Procedure for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
of the People's Republic of China" were adopted on 24 Nov. 1987.
China's current
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">constitution</a>" 
was adopted 4 Dec. 1982 
by the 5th NPC, albeit has been revised about 5 times since then.
-->
The first NPC adopted the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">1954</a>
constitution
on 20 Sept. 1954 and it appears from its
<a href="http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=52993&lib=law">text</a> 
that the multilevel structure of the NPC, and its powers, were essentially the
same in 1954 as in 2018.  However the mechanics of
the election method are not described in the 1954 constitution (at least not that I noticed).
Instead they are descibed in an electoral law. 
<ul><li>
The first electoral law was passed in March 1953.
An English translation of it was published.
The second was passed on 1 July
<a href="ChinaElectLaw1982.html">1979</a>, with later amendments in 1982, 1986, 1995, and 2004.
<!--Chen p.65.-->
According to Bedeski 1986,
the 1979 law "extended direct elections to the county level people's congresses, 
and also introduced the practice of <i>multiple candidates for each seat</i>. 
This reform is part of the general trend towards increased stress on legality 
and democracy in the PRC."
</li><li>
I believe that the point of the "elections" with only 1 candidate, 
had been:
voters could vote for or against him, and if &ge;50% were "against" he would
not be allowed to take the seat.
</li><li>
The 1979 law allowed for ordinary voters to nominate candidates, unlike the 1953 law 
which provided no such mechanism.  This was another substantial liberalization.
<!--Chen p.65.-->
</li><li>
The 1982 revision of the 1979 law removed the reference to the ability of political 
parties, mass organizations, and voters to use "various forms of publicity", and 
instead instructed that the "election committees should introduce the candidates 
to the voters; the political parties, mass organizations, and voters who recommend 
the candidates can introduce them at group meetings of the voters."
<br>
In other words, the "democracy" is not to involve campaigning and media examination.
<!--Chen p.69.-->
</li><li>
In 1986, the election law was amended to disallow primary elections.
<!--p.142 of
Barrett L. McCormick: "Elections to Local People's Congresses". 
Pp.1301-56 in 
Political Reform in Post-Mao China: Democracy and Bureaucracy in a Leninist State. 
University of California Press 1990.-->
</li><li>
In 2004 the constitution was amended to make <i>local</i> people's congresses have
3-year terms, not 5.
</li></ul>
<p>
According to professor <a href="NiouChinaElect.pdf">Emerson M.S. Niou</a>,
traditionally
village chiefs had been appointed by the township government,
<!--Niou p.3.-->
but the 
<a href="ChinaOrganicVill.html">Organic Law</a>
of Village Committees (enacted 1987 and implemented 1988; revised Nov.1998)
stipulated that the chairman, vice-chairman, and members of village
committees are to be elected directly by villagers, by secret ballot,
for a term of three years.  By the end of
1997, elections of village committees allegedly
had been held in most parts of rural China.
This all was after initial experiments with this kind of democracy by
Deng Xiaoping during the early 1980s.  His idea apparently was that introducing
this amount of democracy might have the beneficial effect of
reducing corruption.
<!--Niou p.4-5.-->
</p><p>
Hogg's 2010 <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-10722684">BBC News</a>
story claimed
that Chinese state media regularly reports on vote-buying 
and corruption during these elections to discredit wider implementation in 
higher levels of government.
<!-- Chris Hogg:
"Buying votes in China: village polls 'costing more'," BBC News  (22 July 2010). 
-->
</p><p>
<a href="NiouChinaElect.pdf">Niou</a>
claims that the 1987 Organic Law did not specify the election <i>method</i>,
and that decision was then made by
the provincial People's Congresses and local governments.  The result
was a wide variety of systems, including one unique to China which Niou calls
the "accumulative ballot."
That ballot contains only the names
of the candidates without specifying the positions the candidates are running for. The
candidates are simultaneously considered for all three types of positions. When voters
cast their votes, they specify the positions they expect the candidates to fill. The
candidate who receives the highest votes for the position of committee chairman wins the
chairmanship. For losers, the votes collected by them as chairman are counted toward the
votes for the next position.
</p><p>
Presumably the same sort of approval voting system used in the NPC also is used 
in a goodly percentage of the "Organic" elections.
</p>
<a name="Questions"></a>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<img src="GDPperCapChinaIndia.png" align="right" width="30%">
<p><b>How well has it worked?</b>
It is very difficult for me to tell to what extent
the system that is supposed to be used in the NPC, really is.
What does the NPC really do?
How well does it do it?
</p><p>
Clearly China as a whole has,
by some measures, been a tremendous success.
According to world-bank statistics during 1990-2014, and
also according to IMF statistics during 1980-2016, China
ranked second in GDP <i>per capita</i> (PPP) %growth among countries with over
1 million population at 11.4%, topped only by Equatorial Guinea
with 17.8% or 12.4% respectively; 
and since Equatorial Guinea's 2016 population was 1.2 million,
China's GDP/capita growth was <i>top</i> among countries exceeding 2 million population.
(This economic success of Equatorial Guinea was mainly due to the 1996 discovery
of huge oil reserves in a country at that time mired in extreme poverty.  
Politically speaking, the place was and remains a disaster.)
Note 1980-2016 <i>corresponds almost exactly</i> with the approval-voting period in
China's National Congress (this also is the period when China
dramatically outperformed India); and 1990-2014 corresponds well to the subspan featuring
"organic" local elections.
I cannot guarantee that is not just a coincidence, but it is
a pretty impressive one.
</p><p>
As a result of all that growth, China is on track to become the world's
largest economy sometime between 2025 and 2030.
[Also during 1990-2007, China ranked 2nd in GDP %growth among countries with over
1 million population at 12.4%, topped only by Vietnam with 13.3%,
according to UN statistics.]
<!-- Pop China 2007: 1.318B,  1990: 1.135B,  ratio=1.161   6.28
Pop Vietnam 2007:84.22,  1990:66.02M,   ratio=1.275    6.55 
Vietnam also did better than China for GDP/capita. -->
</p><p>
In my opinion China's "one child policy" has also been a tremendous success
unequalled by any other country, and a goodly part of the reason that China
has outperformed (e.g.) India.
</p><p>
But in some other ways China has not been so successful. 
For example as of 2018 China has been 
<a href="https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/rankings_by_country.jsp">claimed</a> to be the 7th 
most polluted country based on surveys, behind only
Myanmar, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Egypt.
(And China has at times claimed Mongolia as a substate, although
it presently is claimed to be independent and sovereign.)
The WHO estimated that due to synergy of  its high pollution and population levels,
there were 7 deaths caused by air pollution
per 10000 Chinese in year 2017 &ndash; the 5th worst among all countries
(the worst was Turkmenistan with 10.8).
But China was ranked 118th of 178 countries on the year-2014 
<a href="http://archive.epi.yale.edu/epi/country-rankings">environmental performance index</a>
combining a multiplicity of factors
(smaller rankings are better; China's score is about half that of the best country,
Switzerland).
</p><p>
<b>How many votes are we talking about?</b>
If it is really true that over half the adult population
of China votes each 5 years, that is large.  China's population as of 2018 is
estimated to be 1.4 billion.  Certainly the number of voters is at least 6 million.
</p><p>
In 1979-1981, according to official statistics
of 2712 counties whose official electoral population totalled &asymp;542 million,
their number of registered voters was 539 million, and of those 516 million
actually voted (95.8%).
Leung confirms that 95% voting rates are common but says no official announcements
are made concerning the rates of invalid ballots.  
Leung also says there are "mobile ballot boxes"
which travel around to voters at their homes thus increasing turnout versus if all 
people traveled to the polling places.  
Leung gives an example of the Beijaio district
in the Tianjin 1987 elections, in which 100% of 358 registered voters
voted, of whom 214 traveled to a polling place, while the remaining 144
(who must have been "sick") voted using the mobile ballot box.
</p><p>
Babones 2017
claimed that in 2017 there were 89 million voters for the NPC elections, 
with 99% turnout, and that the voters were Communist Party members only.
He gave no evidence.
Babones also notes that China's claimed turnouts exceed
the highest turnouts in (what normally are considered to be) democracies.
The highest of these are around 90% and the lowest around 10%, depending
on what country and what election.
Babones claims all China's elections above the local level are in reality rigged and
just rubberstamp decisions really made beforehand by the Communist Party.
I find it hard to know how true that claim is.

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
As of 2018, China is, for the most part anyhow, an autocratic fake democracy.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that both China's local and national
governments <i>do</i>, by design, contain democratic
elements, and that China's leadership wishes for at least some of 
the things it wants to be democratic, to work as well as possible.
And they are not idiots.
So it should be a source of embarrassment for (e.g.) the USA,
that the autocratic society of China, inside those democratic elements has adopted
the <i>superior</i> <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting system.
