<H2> Would having more third parties be a good thing? </H2>

<p>
<small>Jan Kok on why he'd prefer more parties in US politics:
</small>
</p>


<ol>
<li>  I want my favorite alternative party to grow in influence and win
more elections. If voters are not "forced" to vote for the D or R
(only), but can freely vote for alternative party candidates, then
<i>all</i> the alternative parties will get better vote results, attract
more attention, and be able to grow.
<blockquote>
But: What's good about having lots of alternative parties grow in strength?
<br>
Aren't you satisfied with the Crips and the Bloods?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>  In general, competition is a good thing. Give voters more choices!
</li>
<li>  
In the 2004 election, essentially all of the alternative parties stood
on the same side (opposite to both major-party candidates) on
several important issues: against the Iraq war, the Patriot Act, the drug war,
the WTO, NAFTA and for reducing the national debt. Thus, I would have preferred
<i>any</i> alternative party candidate over the D or R in most federal
races.
</li>
<li>  More ideas would enter the public debate. Surely <i>some</i> of the ideas
promoted mainly by alternative parties are good ideas... 
With the 2-party domination we have now, the Ds and Rs control the agenda,
and the ideas of the alternative parties are mostly ignored.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is not commonly recognized how hugely US politics has suffered an
idea-deficit as a consequence
of the fact that it shuts out third-parties.   
That is because most people do not realize how many third parties there have been
and how diverse they have been.   There have been <a href="USpartiesList.html">800</a>
political parties in US congressional-election history.
