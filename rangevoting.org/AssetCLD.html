<H2> Asset voting was invented by Lewis Carroll (Charles L. Dodgson)! </H2>


<p>
<a href="Asset.html">Asset voting</a>
was invented independently in 2004 by Warren D. Smith and 
(a somewhat different version somewhat earlier) by Forest W. Simmons.
Or so we thought.

William Poundstone's popular-science book 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Vote-Elections-Arent-About/dp/0809048930">Gaming The Vote</a>
comes out in Feb. 2008 and includes the following quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
STV is not the only possible proportional representation system.  
Charles Dodgson devised a clever one of his own, with the novel feature 
that the "eliminated" candidates themselves decide how to redistribute their supporters' votes.  
In 1884 Dodgson pitched his voting system to Lord Salisbury, leader of the 
Conservative Party and future prime minister.
</blockquote>

Poundstone commented:
As I understand it, Dodgson/Carroll's PR scheme was similar to Forest Simmons' 
version of asset voting. You vote for a single candidate, and candidates without 
enough votes to be elected decide who gets their votes. I'm not sure 
whether Dodgson specifically contemplated the wheeling and dealing aspect of it. 
</p><P>
This part may be wrong, but I have the impression that the candidates were eliminated 
successively, STV-style(?) &ndash; rather than having a single, free-wheeling 
negotiation session. It was the candidates, rather than ballot ranking, that 
determined how to "transfer" votes.

was in real life 
The Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898).
He taught mathematics (he invented a remarkable way to evaluate matrix determinants)
and also was an early pioneer in
photography.
</p>
<p>
Dodgson was one of the first to examine voting from the standpoint of a mathematician.
Indeed, some think he was the best of the early investigators.
However, his work was largely forgotten and under-appreciated for about 100 years.
It did not help that Dodgson/Carroll
did not write down his deeper mathematical thoughts because he
wanted to make his voting pamphlets more popular.
That caused his thoughts to appear to be pretty shallow and trivial.
That changed when Glasglow economist Duncan Black (who, with Kenneth Arrow,
initiated the modern revival in mathematical examination of
voting) carefully re-examined Dodgson's old works and 
inferred that Dodgson had to have known a good deal more than he actually said, and
in some ways was 50 years ahead of his time.
However, Black <i>also</i> unfortunately was under-appreciated during his career.
</p>
<p>
Dodgson was the first to explore the 
<a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html">paradoxes</a>,
such as refusing to elect Condorcet winners,
suffered by 
<a href="IrvExec.html">instant runoff voting</a>.
He also was one of the first, perhaps even <i>the</i> first, to codify the notion
of <a href="PropRep.html">Proportional Representation</a>
and prove "proportionality theorems."
If you read page 210 (second column) of
<a href="assets/documents/BlackCarrollAER2.pdf">Black's re-examination of Dodgson's voting pamphlet (pdf)</a>,
then you will see that Lewis Carroll invented "Asset Voting" in 1884 and recognized
that it enjoyed a proportionality theorem.   
</p>
<p>
The sources below  discuss Black &amp; Dodgson.
It is claimed that Dodgson was the first person
to prove a proportionality theorem for "single nontransferable vote" SNTV.
SNTV only is proportional, though, if the voters act cooperatively and strategically,
a fact which Dodgson saw using one of the first uses of "game theory."
Such cooperative strategy cannot be considered realistic unless all the voters
follow "party recommendations" when voting, and those party recommendations 
are devised by strategists who decide to <i>sacrifice</i>
some but not all of
their-party's candidates.   With "asset voting," Dodgson saw the same proportionality
result arises for the same reason, but the unrealistic underlying assumptions are
no longer needed.
</p><p>
Asset voting seems by far the <i>simplest</i> voting system with a proportionality theorem.
It surely is a very <i>natural</i> system, since it was invented independently
by at least three different people, all arriving from different chains of thought, but
all recognizing its proportionality theorem.
It is surprising it has not gotten more attention.
We find that even more surprising now.
