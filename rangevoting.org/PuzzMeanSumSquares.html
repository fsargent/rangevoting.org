Puzzle #??: The point with least sum of <i>squared</i> distances
</H2>

<p>
Given N point-sites in a Euclidean space, suppose we wish to find the point
X (which is not necessarily a site) whose sum of <i>squared</i> distances to the N sites
is minimal.
</p><ol type="A"><li>
Show that X is the <i>mean</i> of the N sites.
</li><li>
More generally if we wish to minimize the <i>weighted</i> sum of the 
squared distances to the N sites where each site <i>k</i> is associated with
a pre-specified positive weight w<sub>k</sub>, then
show that X is the <i>weighted mean</i> (using the same weights) of the N sites.
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>a.</b>
The squared distance function x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>+...+z<sup>2</sup>
obviously is strictly concave-&cup; hence the sum of 
squared distances to the sites &ndash; call it G(X) &ndash; is strictly
concave-&cup; (and goes to &infin; when |X|&rarr;&infin;)
hence has a unique minimum.
This minimum occurs when the partial derivatives of G(X) with respect to each of
its coordinates, all are 0.
</p><center>
G(X) = &sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;N</sub> (X-s<sub>k</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
</center><p>
Hence G(X)'s partial derivative with respect to (say) the y-coordinate of the
vector X is
</p><center>
2 &sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;N</sub> (y - t<sub>k</sub>)
</center><p>
where t<sub>k</sub> denotes the y-coordinate of 
s<sub>k</sub>.
Setting this to 0 we find 
</p><center>
y = N<sup>-1</sup> &sum;<sub>1&le;k&le;N</sub> t<sub>k</sub>
</center><p>
which is the arithmetic mean of the  t<sub>k</sub>.  The discussion is the same for
every other coordinate.   We conclude X must be the coordinatewise arithmetic mean of the
sites.
</p><p><b>b.</b>
If the weights are positive integers then the same proof goes through 
after simply making w<sub>k</sub> copies of site k.
If they are positive rationals this is still valid by scaling by common denominator.
If they are positive reals it still is valid by continuity and the fact the rationals 
are everywhere dense within the reals.
(Or, you could just redo the approach of the preceding proof but introducing weights 
into all expressions; that also works.)
