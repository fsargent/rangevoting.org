<H1> Rob Richie tries to attack approval voting, falls on face </H1>
<p><small>(Skip to <a href="#conclu">conclusion</a>)</small></p>

<p>
Rob Richie, the head of FairVote.org,
on 8 May 2013, posted the following criticism of <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting on
the web as a comment to a video about approval voting.  
Richie's comment was directed to the judges of a contest
and aimed to stop the video from winning that contest's multi-$1000 prize.
We give Richie's entire criticism, verbatim, 
in full (no attempt to correct his spelling or grammar errors), with green background.
We have numbered his paragraphs for reference.
</p>

<b>1.</b>
Advocates of different methods of voting for single winner offices have a history of rather fractious behavior, but it's improving. Congratulations on that front to those seeking to work more cooperatively.
</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
That said, here's the core difference of opinion. Aaron Hamlin is right that "you can always vote for your favorite in approval voting." That's a good thing, and a good reason to like the system. But problem is that voting for your second favorite can be a problem. Why? Because it counts equally with your favorite and, as a result, can lead to the defeat of your favorite candidate. That means anyone who think their favorite as a chance to win are going to be wary of voting for their second choice -- and we're heading back toward plurality voting dynamics.
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Let's be concrete. Among the few examples of contested elections with approval voting are student elections for president the past couple years in Dartmouth. In both of them, the winner earned the approval of less than than 40% of voters. Perhaps that means voters just didn't know much about the candidates. But perhaps it means many didn't want to dilute their vote for their favorite by voting for their second favorite also.
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
Another example was at U-Colorado this year. In the two-candidate race for student government president, the result seems to have been 51.9% to 51.6%. The margin was 22 votes, with 246 students apparently voting for both candidates. Did those 246 students really mean to do that? Did they have a difference of opinion that might have tipped the balance if only voting for one ticket?
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
Ranked choice voting and traditional runoffs both don't have that property, which may explain why advocates of those approaches have been far more successful in having their reforms implemented and used in meaningfully contested elections.
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
But kudos for having a conversation about reform and it's great to focus on the fact that plurality voting is simply unacceptable -- as this video successful demonstrates.
</p><p>
<b>7.</b>
Finally, let's keep in mind that if we want broader and fairer representation for more of us, we have to have more elections where more than one person wins -- and those winners can represent different opinions and voters. A big focus for some reformers is changing winner-take-all voting rules to fair voting plans like these ones FairVote has drawn for Congress at http://www.fairvoting.us

<p>
In Richie's attempt to be "concrete" (his paragraphs 3 &amp; 4)
he actually cites five numbers in his entire criticism.
We will now check his facts. We find that three of Richie's five numbers were wrong, 
for a <b>total correctness rate of 40%.</b>
Congratulations Rob, you are, as you put it, "improving."
And "kudos" to you for trying to mention facts.  It would be better to 
actually <i>cite  sources</i> for your facts because that tends to help in getting
them right, and it would be better to aim for a correctness rate above 50%,
since that way people would think you were more reliable than a random coin flip.   
But it's great to focus on having facts.

<b>The University of Colorado.</b>
In the spring 2013 election for CUSG president, 
Lora Roberts, director of communications for CUSG, sent us the following in private email
(in response to our enquiry):
 "The total number of voters was 6,686 in this election, which is the third largest in the 
last ten years."
The election 
<a href="http://cusg.colorado.edu/content/spring-2013-election-results-cusg">results</a> were
</P><table align="center">
<tr><td>Chris Schaefbauer, Ellie Roberts, Marco Dorado, UNITE </td><th>3354
(Elected)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Logan Schlutz, Alexis Scobie, Colby Schwartz, INSPIRE </td><th>3332
</th></tr>
</table><p>
Observe that   6686=3354+3332 exactly. 
Therefore, the total number of voters who voted for both candidates, 
was <b>not 246</b>, as Richie claimed,
but exactly <b>zero.</b>
(In order to have 246 both-way-voting voters, the total would have had to have been
6440=3354+3332-246 voters, in which case Richie's
"51.6" and "51.9" still both would have been wrong.)
The percentages were <b>not</b> 51.6 and 51.9, as Richie claimed, but 50.2 and 49.8.
The correct figures show the exact opposite of what Richie was trying to show, in the most
convincing manner possible (you cannot get lower than zero).
But Richie did get the margin &ndash; 22 approvals &ndash; right: 3354-3332=22.

<b>Dartmouth.</b>
As we will now show, Richie was correct that the winners in the 2 most recent student president
elections did get &lt;40% approval, although not the 3rd-most recent.
(But I do not see why this represents something "wrong" with 
approval voting.  If approval <i>never</i> permitted all candidates to have below 40% approval,
which apparently is a situation Richie would prefer,
then I would understand why <i>that</i> would be a distortionary voting system.):

In the election for 2013 Student Assembly president,
Adrian Ferrari '14 was elected student body president

More importantly than
Dartmouth, all three of <b>France's</b> presidential elections of 
<a href="France2012.html">2012</a>, 
<a href="French2007studies.html">2007</a>, 
and
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">2002</a>, 
were studied with an approval-voting-style exit poll study, and in them the winner 
had, respectively, 61%, 42.8%, and 36.7% approval,
with the voters approving, on average, 2.58, 2.33, and 3.15 candidates.
In the
<a href="French2007studies.html">2007</a>
French election, incidentally, Approval worked well, electing 
the Condorcet winner Bayrou, while IRV malfunctioned, electing 
Sarkozy. 
</p><p>
It is quite common 
that the winner has below 50% approval &ndash;
but also quite common for him to have above 50%.
For more examples, the "approval ratings" of US presidential candidates
(in polls approaching election day)
are given <a href="RangePolls.html">here</a>.

It is however, quite rare that real world approval voters approve both of 
the top-two most likely candidates to win in situations where there 
are 2 main rivals 
and the rest have smaller chances.  (The way Richie fantasized happened in CU's 2013
election.)
It can certainly happen, but voters
rarely are that strategically stupid.  We have data on this. 
Thus in the 2002 France election, 
the two top approval rivals were Chirac &amp; Jospin, no others came close 
enough to be 
likely to win.   There were only 15 voters who approved both, out of 
2597 total voters, i.e. 0.58%.   
Why did those 15 voters do this? We don't know, but possibilities include:
</p><ol>
<li>
They did not <i>realize</i> Jospin &amp; Chirac were going to be the top two rivals.
</li><li>
They did not <i>care</i> which one won, but did want to help make sure
that it was not going to be certain other candidates (e.g. Le Pen).
</li><li>
Or (for those who approved neither): 
they did not care which, but wanted to help make sure they both <i>lost</i>.
</li><li>
They made a <i>mistake</i> when filling out their ballots, e.g. due to poor eyesight.
</li>
</ol><p>
More interesting are races where there are <i>three</i> big 
rivals all with roughly equal chances.  (E.g. Dartmouth's 2011 and 2012 races.)
In that case, approving 1 or approving 2 of the three 
can be strategically wise, but it is unwise to approve 0 or 3.  (Although, again,
for a voter who does not care which of the three win, it would be reasonable to approve
either none or all 3.)
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Deceptive logic.</b>
We also object to the following.
Richie deceptively
acts as though in "ranked choice voting" 
there is no strategic reason not to rank your favorite first and
your second favorite second.  That's wrong.  
(Here "ranked choice voting" is the deceptive name Richie promulgated for
Instant Runoff Voting &ndash; <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> &ndash; 
actually there are <i<>hundreds</i> of very different 
ranked choice voting methods, and IRV is simply the one Richie favors.) 
</p><p>
Indeed, Although Richie complains that "[approving] your second favorite...
can lead to the defeat of your favorite [with approval voting]" he fails to mention that
voting for your <i>genuine</i> favorite can lead to his <i>own</i> defeat
[with Richie's recommended system IRV].  Doesn't that seem more serious?

In the IRV election at left, <b>A wins</b>.  (IRV eliminates C then A beats B by 17 to 12.)
That is because 2 "B&gt;C&gt;A" voters foolishly voted <i>for</i> their favorite B.  If they
had instead lowered B in their rankings, dishonestly voting "C&gt;B&gt;A", then
we'd instead have election at right.  In that election <b>B wins</b>.  (IRV eliminates A, then
B beats C by 19 to 10.)
</p><p>
In fact, both "ranking your favorite top" and "ranking your second-favorite 2nd-top"
can be strategic mistakes by an IRV voter which cause
a worse candidate to win, than if that voter had lied about her favorite (or lied about 
her 2nd favorite, or lied about both, or refused to vote at all).
In short, in Instant Runoff Voting it
<a href="TarrIrv.html">can</a>
be a <b>strategic mistake to tell the truth about your favorite.</b> 
It can also be a 
<b>strategic mistake to tell the truth about your second-favorite.</b>
It <a href="IRVpartic.html">can</a> also be a 
<b>strategic mistake to vote at all.</b>
Also IRV voters 
<a href="Monotone.html">can</a>
be <b>forced to dishonestly pretend their 2nd favorite is better than their true favorite</b>.
The ways in which these phenomena can happen can be
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV.html">surprising</a> and 
<a href="rangeVirv.html#bramsex">unexpected</a>, but
unfortunately arise fairly <a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">frequently</a>.
Indeed, Rob Richie, in his only publication ever in a scientific journal,
[with Terrill Bouricius &amp; Philip J. Macklin in <i>Science</i> Magazine 294,5541 
(May 2001) 303-306] stated "Used for decades in Australia and Ireland and 
considered in 13 state legislatures this year, IRV lets voters rank candidates in 
preference order. A voter's best strategy is to sincerely rank the candidates."   
This quote was simply false.  It is <a href="IncentToExagg.html">not</a> true
that a voter's best strategy in IRV, is to sincerely rank the candidates.
But kudos for Rob Richie for publishing in a scientific journal!  It's just too bad that
the most important claim in his article was false
and was refuted by return mail &ndash; but he's trying so hard!
</p>
<img src="ApprovalThreshold.png" alt="approval threshold" align="left"/>
<p>
In contrast in approval voting, it is <i>never</i> a strategic mistake to truthfully approve
your favorite.  It can be a strategic mistake to approve your second-favorite
(might defeat your favorite!), but 
probably more often, it is a strategic mistake to <i>fail</i> to approve
your second-favorite.  (You might get stuck with some winner you really hate, rather
than your 2nd choice, who was decent.)
But with approval voting, neither approving, nor disapproving, your 2nd-favorite,
is "dishonest."  Depending on the quality-level 
you choose for your "approval threshold" both could be regarded as 
"honest."  
</p>
<p>
<b>Pictorial example:</b> If you use the blue line
as your "approval threshold," then approve
A only. If the red line, then approve both A and B. If the yellow line,
then approve A,B, and C.  All would be "honest" approval votes.  (The vertical axis is
"candidate quality" as perceived by some voter, namely you.
Approving D but <i>not</i> A would be a "dishonest" approval ballot.
We do not recommend that.)
</p>
<p>
You, the voter, have to make that strategic
call to decide which risks are more probable and more severe &ndash; but
either way you go, you still have not sunk to lying.
And it is straightforward to make that call, unlike in IRV where it can be complicated
and mysterious, so much
so that Rob Richie, the USA's foremost IRV advocate, got it wrong in his only
scientific publication, then <a href="CoreSupp.html">got it wrong some more</a>.
</p><p>
If you agree with our "probably more often," then Richie's
claim this issue leads us "back toward plurality voting dynamics" was probably exactly the 
opposite of the truth. Also, this whole issue <i>favors</i> approval voting versus IRV,
even though Richie makes it sound like the opposite.
So to review:
</p>
<table bgcolor="orange">
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>Voting method</th>
<th>"Honesty re Favorite" is safe?</th>
<th>"Honesty re 2nd-Favorite" is strategically safe?</th>
<th>Voting never worse for you than not voting?</th>
<th>How hard to assess?</th></tr>
<tr><th>APPROVAL VOTING</th>
<td align="center">Yes. Always.</td>
<td>Could be mistake to approve 2nd-fav; also could be mistake to disapprove
(probably latter happens more often).  
But either way, you have not yet been forced to lie. (Which is good for society, since lie-votes 
tend to <a href="BayRegsFig.html">diminish</a>
the quality of the winners a voting system chooses.)</td>
<td align="center">Correct.</td>
<td align="center">Straightforward.</td></tr>
<tr><th>IRV (Richie's favorite)</th>
<td align="center">No.</td>
<td>No (i.e. same situation as for approval, except
worse in sense voter may be forced to <i>lie</i>
about her 2nd favorite).</td>
<td align="center">No.</td>
<td>Too hard for Rob Richie, USA's foremost IRV propagandist, even to recognize these 
problems <i>exist</i> for <i>years</i>.  (Although these were 
well known to voting theory community.)
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A voting system even more favored by Richie's "second favorite" issue would be 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>,
since in Approval voting, if you approve your second-favorite, then
you effectively rate him 
equal to to your genuine favorite.  With score voting, you could rate him (say) 
"only 90% as good"  (or whatever number you like).
But as both the table and real life experience 
shows, even approval voting (which makes no attempt whatever to allow that)
still seems, if anything, superior to IRV on this issue.
</p><p>
And that is true even with election data specifically cherrypicked by Richie himself
to make approval look maximally bad (if we use the <i>correct</i> data)!
</p><p>
But for the purposes of argument, let's suppose Richie's utterly false Colorado claims
actually had been true.   Even then &ndash; so what?  Richie would then be complaining
that "A beat B by 51.9% to 51.6% approval, but really maybe B should have won
because 3% of the voters approved both, whereas really maybe they would have split 60:40
in favor of B if they hadn't been so confused by the horribly hard-to-fathom approval system."
(Actually zero out of 6686 voters were thus-confused, but Richie is very fearful about
that confusion.  The <i>genuinely</i>-confusing 
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV.html">behavior</a> of IRV,
and the immensely complexity of official IRV election-worker 
<a href="NCIRVrules.html">instructions</a>,
and the fact that spoiled ballot <a href="SPRatesSumm.html">rates</a>
decrease with approval but increase with IRV,
apparently bother him much less.)
With Richie's postulation, B should have beaten A by 53.8 to 53.3 so democracy was denied.
Was this a disaster?   Hardly.  This was "an extremely close election" so swinging
it is a very tiny denial of democracy.   In contrast, the Australian House,
elected by IRV, failed to elect even a single third party candidate in 3 election cycles 
in a row (2001, 2004, 2007) which perhaps is why Australians
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">want</a>
to get rid of it.  Now <i>that</i> is a denial/distortion of democracy
causing far more damage.
</p>
<a name="conclu"></a>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>
It is rather revealing that even Rob Richie, the foremost IRV propagandist in the USA, after 
decades of professional experience and the beneficiary of millions of dollars in funding, 
was unable to produce an anti-approval pro-IRV argument better
than the one at top (even with thousands of dollars at stake).
