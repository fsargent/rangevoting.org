<H2> Instant Runoff (IRV) voting system  (Executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Score voting is simpler than IRV.
</li>
<li>
Score voting is more expressive than IRV.
</li>
<li>
Score voting works on every <a href="VotMach.html">voting machine</a> in the USA, including
noncomputerized ones, right now,
without modification and without reprogramming.
But IRV cannot be made to work on many kinds of voting machines.
When <a href="SanFranDelay.html">San Francisco</a>
adopted IRV it screwed up and was unable to announce all nontrivial
election results, supposedly for weeks; and <a href="SanFranMachines.html">now may have to abandon
its counting machines entirely</a>.
</li>
<li>
Adopting IRV will cause voter errors ("spoiled" ballots) to become 
<a href="SPRates.html">7 times more frequent</a>
(based on San Francisco numbers).
But adopting score voting appears to decrease errors.
</li>
<li>
Score voting is <i>monotonic</i>, i.e. increasing your vote for somebody can help 
but cannot hurt them.
IRV is not monotonic.
</li>
<li>
In score voting, scoring your favorite candidate top cannot hurt either
you or him. 
In IRV, it can hurt you.
</li>
<li>
With IRV the "Nader spoiler" and "wasted vote" problems are
<a href="IRVcs.html">not</a> solved,
contrary to <a href="Irvtalk.html">pro-IRV-propaganda</a>.
Indeed, because of fear of these very effects
(or for whatever reason), IRV voters tend to rank third-party
candidates below top (even if favorite) and hence prevent their election,
which presumably is why every
IRV country is and always has become <a href="Duverger.html">2-party-dominated</a>.
For this reason IRV cannot attract support from intelligent third-party members.
</li>
<li>
IRV makes <a href="TieRisk.html">ties</a> and other nightmare-scenarios much more likely;
Score voting makes them much less likely.
</li>
<li>
IRV is historically more likely than score voting merely to lead to
a <a href="BackSlide.html">backslide</a> to plurality voting.
</li>
<li>
IRV will (in <href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">plausible scenarios</a>)
elect candidate X in preference to candidate Y, even though
based on the IRV ballots themselves, 
Y is pairwise-preferred over X (and over everybody else too)
by an arbitrarily-huge supermajority of the voters.
This happened in 
the <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a> mayoral election
and appears to have happened in
both the <a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006</a> presidential election
(but less dramatically; merely a "55% majority" rather than a "huge supermajority" was
thwarted) and the <a href="FunnyElections.html#ch70">Chile 1970</a> presidential election
(this time with about a 2:1 ratio supermajority being thwarted).
Probably this fiasco had something to do with why Burlington repealed IRV.
</li>
<li>
See also our reports on the
<a href="Ireland1990.html">Ireland 1990</a> 
and 
<a href="Aus07.html">Australia 2007</a>
IRV elections and their pathologies.  
These were some of the most important IRV
elections ever.
</li>
<li>
Raising your most-hated candidate in your IRV vote from bottom to top-ranked
can actually <i><a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">improve</a></i> the 
election winner (in your view)!
</li>
<li>
IRV must be counted centrally and <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">cannot</a>
be counted in precincts, there is no longer
such a thing as a precinct "subtotal."  This can decrease election transparency and
raise the risk of a centrally organized fraud.
</li>
<li>
Score voting is less complicated than IRV, both for the vote-counters, and also for the voter in
the sense that experimental timings show voters score candidates faster than they rank-order them.
</li>
<li>
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">Poll evidence</a>
indicates score voting also is more popular than IRV with real voters.
Indeed, the most experienced IRV-using country by far, Australia, wishes it could
get rid of IRV so much, that they'd actually go back to plain plurality voting 
(by large margins in 3 polls) if offered that choice in a referendum; also
IRV was rejected by massive 68-32 margin
in favor of plain plurality in a 2011 nationwide referendum in the UK;
meanwhile poll evidence from France indicates voters would, if given the choice in a referendum,
switch to score voting right now (and they prefer it over approval voting too).
</li>
<li>
Score voting is <a href="BayRegsFig.html">better</a>
than IRV measured using <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian regret</a>
yardstick in computer simulations.
</li>
<li>
IRV exhibits an artifical bias favoring electing <a href="IrvExtreme.html">extremist</a>
candidates and against <a href="IrvCenterSqueeze.html">centrists</a>.
In contrast <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> can have pro-centrist bias, and with 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting there
is little or no bias favoring either.
</li>
<li>
Contrary to <a href="Irvtalk.html">pro-IRV-propaganda</a>,
pathological IRV elections seem unpleasantly 
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">common</a> in practice.
(Theory: <a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html">Pathology Survey</a>.
Real-world: e.g. see our surveys of the 
<a href="LAgovs.html">Louisiana governor</a>
and
<a href="Aus07.html">Australia House 2007</a> elections.)
Two of the  last five <a href="Debian2003.html">Debian</a> elections
would have exhibited pathologies had they been held using IRV.
Here's a horrible multi-pathology <a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">example</a> election.
