<H2>  Duverger's three laws of political party development </H2>

<p>
The following is a verbatim French&rarr;English translation of Duverger's own words
(a 1980 statement by Maurice Duverger):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The <a href=https://rangevoting.org/Plurality.html">plurality</a>
(1 winner) voting system tends to lead to a 2-party system. 
</li><li>
The <a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>
(multiwinner) system tends to lead to many
mutually independent parties.
</li><li>
The 2-ballot majority system
[<a href="HonestRunoff.html">top-2 (delayed) runoff</a>]
tends to lead to multipartism moderated by alliances.
</li></ol>

William H. Riker:
[<i>The Two-party System and Duverger's Law: An Essay on the History of Political Science</i>,
Amer. Polit. Sci. Review 76 (December 1982) 753-766]
argued that actually,
the theoretical link between the single-seat district plurality (winner-take-all) 
rule used in the US and UK, and a two-party system, really was
first put forward by Henry Droop almost 90 years before Duverger did it.
