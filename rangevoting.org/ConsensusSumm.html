<H2> Is range voting the consensus choice of the experts? </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Unfortunately as of 2006 there is <i>no</i> visible consensus among 
political scientists, economists, or mathematicians about the best single-winner voting system.

<li>
Examining bylaws of 11
professional societies of economists, mathematicians, and political scientists
and social-choice theorists (plus the 
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, the world's largest technical
professional society), we find

is the maximally-simple degenerate special case of range voting.

In other words, despite the lack of any visible or official consensus
among those studying these areas, there <i>is</i>
a <i>kind</i> of not-so-visible consensus arising, which is: the voting methods they themselves
use as organizations.   Eight such organizations use Approval Voting (AV) while three
specify other systems,  so there seems to be an emerging consensus that AV is the best for
their purposes.   And in fact, we agree AV is a good system for them: easy and
simple (which is important since many of their votes are conducted at meetings
and these organizations rarely or never use software or machines).
And since these organizations almost always have 4 or fewer choices on ballot,
AV's increasing disadvantages versus range when more choices are available, are rarely
an issue for them.  The only organizations mentioned here which often have more than 4
choices on ballot are <a href="Debian2003.html">Debian</a> 
(uses the <a href="SchulzeComplic.html">Schulze beatpaths</a> 
Condorcet method and in 1999-2006 had more than four candidates 5 out of 7 times
if you count NOTA as a "candidate") and Olympic Judges (often need to judge
100 contestants).
