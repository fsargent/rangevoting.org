<H2> Can Condorcet voting be handled by totalizing machines? </H2>

<p>
<b>Q.</b> I'm not convinced that totalizing machines can't be used for a
Condorcet method, through a device similar to the one used to implement
range on noncomputerized totalizing machines.
You simply implement all the pairwise elections...
</p>

<p>
<b>A.</b> Yes, <i>except</i> for two problems.
</p>

<p>
First, 30-candidate elections would
not be doable.
Because, a voter would have to specify his opinion on all 30&times;29/2=435 candidate
pairs. That is too much to ask. 30 inputs is reasonable to ask,
especially if a lot are allowed to be left blank or filled with
some common value, as in range voting.
But 435 is too much.
</p>

<p>
(The Congo held a presidential election in July-August 2006 with 33 candidates.)
</p>

<p>
Second,  the machine would have to
reject "invalid" votes in which the input corresponded to a cyclic directed graph,
i.e. was crazy and clearly not intended by the voter since logically meaningless.
Totalizing machines cannot do that detection and rejection.
</p>

<p>
(Third, I don't think most human voters would like providing this kind of input anyhow
&ndash; they'd find it confusing and annoying. )
<!--
 You could ask for a <i>rank ordering</i>
of the candidates as input, but dumb-totalizing voting machines designed for plurality voting
cannot neither accept, nor check the validity of, such input.) -->
</p>

<p>
For IRV voting, it is even worse since IRV is 
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">not additive</a>
at all, even in terms of pairwise
results, and also since IRV votes are rank orderings and detecting whether a vote <i>is</i>
a rank ordering, and rejecting it as "invalid" otherwise, is beyond noncomputerized 
totalizing machines.
</p>

<p>
So: no.  Borda, Condorcet and IRV voting (the latter for even more reasons)  can<i>not</i> 
be done on
these machines, but range (including <i>both</i> averaging- and totalling-based range
voting) <a href="assets/documents/kokidea.txt">can</a> be done.
