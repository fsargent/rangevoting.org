<H2> Rob Richie's "proof" of the flawed nature of range voting and superiority of IRV </H2>

<p>
Rob Richie of the Center for Voting and Democracy, a pro-IRV
advocacy group (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>="instant runoff voting")
published a well-written essay which claimed to demonstrate in clear terms
the superiority of IRV over all other common voting method proposals, including 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
We critique it below.

<p>
Richie centers everything around 3 criteria:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Criterion 1.</b>
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of majority rule?
In an election with two candidates, the candidate preferred by a
majority should always win."
</blockquote>
<p>
Richie argues that range and <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>
fail criterion #1, which is
technically true, but in practice false. (Richie "explains" how in a
2-candidate approval election, approval voting could fail to elect the
majority winner because 99 voters might approve both candidates
[although they all prefer the first candidate to the second], while
one last voter votes for the second candidate only. Right.) In fact
for practical purposes, <i>every</i> voting method ever seriously put forward
passes criterion #1 and we
would probably be very hard pressed to find any voters as stupid as
Rob Richie postulates.  
</p><p>
It is extremely rare for voters in approval voting elections
to approve all candidates.
For example of the 2587 voters in the <a href="FrenchStudy.html">French study</a>,
only 5 of them approved more than 67% of the candidates, and
only 2 of them
cast all-approval votes (we are amazed to find even those two).
That indicates that this voter behavior is rarer than 
one in a thousand.  
In some rules-variants of approval voting, such as the method used by the United Nations
to choose its Secretary General, all-approval votes are not permitted and would be rejected
even if anybody tried to cast them.
And actually, if you insist on such quibbling, then we
point out that under IRV, voters can either rank zero candidates or
cast a vote that
top-ranks <i>two or more</i> candidates.  Either way, under the very IRV rules advocated
by Richie's own organization, your vote will have the same effect
as an all-approval vote, i.e. none.  Hence according to the strict letter of the law,
IRV does <i>not</i> obey Richie's criterion 1 either.  
In the <a href="SPRates.html">San Francisco IRV elections of 2004</a>
these voter behaviors occurred 0.6% and 8.3% of the time, respectively,
which in total is a rate approximately 100 times the all-approval voting rate for 
approval voting in the French study.  
Thus, Richie's argument, if taken seriously, would be
a far greater indictment of IRV 
than approval voting!
</p><p>
In voting system design, it is an error
to focus on a minor semantic non-problem and elevate it to the status of a
"common sense principle" that must be passed come hell or high water.
This is surely one of the most pathetic arguments "against"
approval voting (and "proving" the "superiority" of IRV) that has ever been proffered.
(And incidentally, range voting <a href="MajCrit.html">does obey</a>
a variant form of the majority criterion.)
Thankfully we now move on now to Richie's
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Criterion 2.</b>
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of requiring a
minimum level of core support? A winner should be at least one voter's
first choice."
</blockquote>
<p>
Criterion #2 is a little more interesting. All Condorcet methods, as well as
range and approval, fail it. However,
<ol type="a">
<li>
I don't actually see why criterion #2 is desirable at all.
With an electorate consisting of two
mutually hostile factions, the best winner could be a neutral,
"compromise" candidate who is no one's first choice but is everyone's
second choice. E.g. in a hypothetical 1930s election between Adolf Hitler
(supported by raging German patriots) versus Josef Stalin (supported
by raging communist Russians), and perhaps throw in Mussolini (supported
by raging Italian fascists) &ndash; all versus a comparatively uninspiring and
unpopular figure such as, say, Herbert Hoover, who would you prefer to
win?  Are you <i>sure</i> you want to <i>insist on principle</i> that Hoover not be
permitted to win, because of his lack of a dedicated "core" of
die-hard, maniacal supporters? Or would you argue that Hoover might be
preferred
over Stalin by the Hitlerites (and vice versa) and all in all would be
a better choice?  I do not see why "common sense" demands Richie's
criterion 2 at all.  In fact, I think the opposite &ndash; common sense
requires us to insist that Richie's criterion 2 should <i>not</i> be demanded.
</li><li>
To say the same thing again:
<table bgcolor="yellow" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tr><th> #voters </th><th> Their Vote </th></tr>
<tr align="center"><td> 35 </td><td> A > B > D > C </td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td> 33 </td><td> C > B > A > D </td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td> 32 </td><td> D > B > C > A </td></tr>
</table>
In this situation, B seems clearly the "best winner"
since changing the winner from B to anybody else will make at least a 65% supermajority
(larger than the greatest "landslide" in US presidential election history)
less happy.  But Richie insists, as a matter of <i>principle</i>, that B must not win!
(Instead, IRV awards the victory to C.  Make sense to you?)
</li><li>
Also, in practice I think violations of this criterion
in large elections will be extremely rare.
E.g. in every election where candidates get to vote for themselves,
I think we can count on everybody being at least one voter's first choice!
If so, then Richie's criterion #2 would be satisfied in practice
by every voting method.  
</li><li>
IRV, in a 100,000-voter 18-candidate
election, <a href="IRVamp.html">can</a> unambiguously elect
a candidate who has only <i>two</i> top-rank votes.  So Richie in using <i>one</i> vote
as the threshold in his criterion
to "distinguish" between IRV and Condorcet methods, really <i>is</i>
caring about two versus one or zero,
i.e. the <i>precise</i> value of this number is utterly crucial for him.
</li><li>
Here's a <a href="CoreSupp.html">simple example</a> of an election where C beats every rival
pairwise by 8-to-5 ratio, and M has the second-least amount of core support
(in particular M has less core support than C), but IRV says M is the winner.
(<a href="CoreSuppPocket.html">Another</a>.)
</li></ol>

</p><P>
Again, Richie takes a minor semantic
non-problem, which essentially every voting system obeys in practice
(and which probably is not even abstractly <i>desirable</i>)
and elevates it to the status of a "common sense principle"
that must be passed to the strict letter of the law come hell or high water.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Criterion 3.</b>
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of rewards for
sincere voting? A voter should not likely be punished for voting
sincerely under the system's rules."
</blockquote>
<p>
Criterion #3 is vaguely phrased ("not likely") in order to allow IRV
allegedly to "pass" it. (It sadly seems obvious Richie began with IRV and engineered
his criteria to make IRV look best, rather than beginning with
criteria and then choosing methods to meet those criteria.) It can be
argued IRV fails it &ndash; depends on what is meant by "not likely" &ndash; but
actually <i>every</i> deterministic non-dictatorial
rank-order-based voting method fails it if the subjective term "not
likely" is replaced by the objective word "never." (That's a famous
<a href="GibbSat.html">theorem</a> of Gibbard and Satterthwaite.) Richie certainly
seems to have an amazing talent for picking criteria satisfied by every or by no voting method
as a means of "discriminating" among them.
</p><P>
Richie then cites
Tideman to the effect that IRV is not very vulnerable to strategy, 
<a href="TidemanRev.html">but</a>
Tideman's "vulnerability to strategy" measure is unfortunately
extremely misleading and misguided.
(E.g. it ignores the strengths of effects caused by strategic
voting, erroneously regarding all effects as equal in severity;
it ignores the fact that many different voter factions all would
<i>simultaneously</I> strategize, instead pretending that
just one does so;
and it ignores the fact that strategic voters will be working with
incomplete information about the other voters.  All that adds up
to a severely distorted measure of "strategic vulnerability."
And indeed, Tideman's measure claims approval voting is actually "substantially worse"
than plurality voting, whereas as far as I can tell every other
worker in the field has unanimously concluded otherwise and
indeed approval voting was <i>designed</i> to exhibit
low vulnerability to strategy.  If one runs 
computer simulations now taking those ignored factors into
account, range voting comes out with far superior <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>
than both IRV and Condorcet methods whether the voters are honest or strategic or any mixture.
Unfortunately Tideman was unaware of our computer simulations at the time he wrote his book.)
</p><p>
Also, while citing Tideman so admiringly, Richie conveniently
forgets to mention that the very Tideman book he cited (summary table page 238), 
concludes as its bottom line that
IRV is an "unsupportable" voting method (provided it
is "feasible" to compute a table of pairwise preference margins,
which it is).  Tideman also concluded Approval and Range are "unsupportable"...
</p>
<p>
And this quote from Nagel that Richie also cites so admiringly
to demonstrate how he is "grounded" in scholarship (Richie actually gave the wrong
page numbers when citing
Nagel's paper, for the correct cite see <a href="BurrDilemma.html">this</a>)
<blockquote>
[Exploitation of non-monotonicity] is indeed possible under [IRV], but the conditions it requires are extraordinarily restrictive. Note that the kind of strategic voting required to exploit non-monotonicity under [IRV] demands far more of voters (and organizers) than its counterpart under approval voting. The approval voter who truncates nevertheless votes quite sincerely for his first choice, whereas the [IRV] manipulator must put her last choice first.
</blockquote>
is also somewhere between very misleading and flat-out false.
First of all, Richie misleadingly acts as though the only problem with
IRV is non-monotonicity and voters seeking to strategically exploit it.
Actually the most major problem with IRV strategic voters is
"favorite betrayal" where it is strategically
better to vote to for your non-favorite rather than your favorite.
A simple computer examination of <i>all</i> possible 3-candidate
N-voter elections (N large) &ndash; which note is not at all "restrictive"! &ndash;
shows that a "favorite betrayal scenario" happens under IRV 
in <a href="IRVStratPf.html#irv">19.6% of them</a>.
</p><p>
IRV's admission of favorite-betrayal scenarios, and <i>commonly</i>,
is a clear way that IRV actually does <i>not</i> "satisfy" Richie's criterion 3.
(Meanwhile:
By theorem,
Range voting <i>never</i> suffers from either favorite-betrayal or non-monotonicity.)
</p><p>
Second, such strategic voting under IRV does not require any "organization" whatsoever.
You simply vote for your preferred major-party candidate top, and your unpreferred one bottom,
thus dishonestly <i>not</i> voting any third-party candidate top, even if
they are your true favorite.
This is a very simple strategy, it <a href="IRVcs.html">works</a>, 
and it explains <a href="TarrIrv.html">why</a> every IRV country has
been massively 2-party <a href="AustralianPol.html#dat564">dominated</a>
in all IRV seats.  Because 19.6% is a lot larger than the 
historical chances of third-party candidates winning IRV seats (well below 1%), 
this strategy is well justified.
Finally, it is completely false (as we just showed) to say that
the IRV manipulator "must put her last choice first" either when it comes to favorite betrayal
(see <a href="IRVcs.html">this example</a> or <a href="IRV1519.html">this</a>) 
or when it comes to <b>non-monotonicity</b>, e.g. consider
this 17-voter example:
<a name="ex17"></a>
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tr><th> #voters </th><th> Their Vote </th></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#eeff88" align="center"><td> 8 </td><td> B>A>C </td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td> 5 </td><td> C>B>A </td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td> 4 </td><td> A>C>B </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
If two of the B>A>C voters change their vote to A>B>C,
that causes their true-favorite B to win under IRV.  (If they vote honestly ranking B top
as is, then their most-hated candidate, C, wins.)
That's an example of "non-monotonicity."
Note that this disproves Richie's false and out of context Nagel quote since
nobody puts their "last choice first"; all put their last choice last.
<a href="ClayIrv2.html">Another example of that</a>.
