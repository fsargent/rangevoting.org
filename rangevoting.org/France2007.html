<H2> Large experimental studies comparing 4 different voting systems in France 2007 </H2>

<p>
The French Presidential election of 2007 was conducted using 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting (21-22 April) 
with a subsequent <a href="TTRvsIRVrevdata.html">top-2-runoff</a> round (5-6 May).
There were <b>12</b> candidates on ballot.
<i>Meanwhile</I>, three different scientific studies of alternative voting systems
were underway, with real voters at official polling places in France &ndash; 
these studies were all conducted by academics with government funding and cooperation.
</p>
<p>
The result is an unprecedently high-quality, head-to-head, fair comparison of
these different voting systems in action in real life.

<h3>Who was the "right" winner?</h3>

<p>
All methods studied agreed that the winner should be either Sarkozy or Bayrou.  Which?
I want to break my usual policy and actually take a stance on that: 
<b>Bayrou was better for France.</b>
I am not saying
this because of any love or dislike of the policies or abilities of Bayrou or Sarkozy.
I am saying it because:
</p><ol type="A">
<li>
Poll data we shall review on this page shows beyond doubt
(99.99999999+% confidence) that Bayrou would have defeated Sarkozy
in a head-to-head simple majority vote in April 2007.
</li><li>
Also, even if you may not agree with simple majority vote because 
voters care unequally... 
Bayrou also beats Sarkozy using both {0,1,2} and {0,1,2,3,4,5} range voting.
</li><li>
With the <i>benefit of hindsight</i> France later came to the conclusion even more strongly
that Bayrou was better.  Specifically as the next (<a href="France2012.html">2012</a>) 
election and the end of
Sarkozy's term both approached, pairwise
polls showed Bayrou's advantage over Sarkozy
had increased to a <i>landslide</i> 56:35 margin!
(<i>Despite</i> the fact that Sarkozy then came 2nd 
in the official vote, and Bayrou 5th, due to the 
flawed and massively distortionary plurality+top-2 runoff voting system used by France!)
</li></ol>

<h3>Notes on the table</h3>
<p>The rank-order-ballot voters were told the voting system would be instant runoff voting.  
Hence, attempts to use those ballots to 
examine other rank-order voting systems such as Coombs elimination
are (somewhat) less justified.
The score-ballot  voters were told the voting system would be median-based 
(Balinski &amp; Laraki's "majority judgment") with no-score counting as zero,
and employed a verbal not numerical value-scale.
Hence, attempts to examine other score-based voting systems such as average-based range voting
with no-score ignored, are (somewhat) less justified.  However, median-based, 
average-based with no-score=zero (and scores 5,4,3,2,1,0),
and
average-based with no-score ignored, all returned the same finish order of their
top 8 candidates. (But see <a href="#aboutMJ">below</a> re geographic bias correction.)
There were no <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycles</a> hence there was
an unambiguous finish order deducible from the rank-order ballots
</p><center>
Condorcet order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Royal&gt;Besancenot&gt;Buffet&gt;Voynet&gt;Laguiller&gt;de
Villiers&gt;Bove&gt;Nihous&gt;LePen&gt;Schivardi
</center><p>
with each finisher successively preferred over
the next, pairwise, by a voter majority.
<a name="duels"></a>
An independent professional France-wide 
<a href="http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/4DDD963575B24D9D98FE6DBC933F19F2.aspx">poll</a>
by <i>Le Figaro</i> Magazine on 14-15 March 2007
(telephone, 1000 sampled, age&ge;18)
assessing the results of three possible
head-to-head runoff rounds ("duel"s) found:
</p><center>
Bayrou=54% vs Sarkozy=46%,  
&nbsp;
Bayrou=60% vs Royal=40%,
&nbsp;
Sarkozy=54% vs Royal=46%
</center><p>
confirming the top three in this order.
(The additive standard error should be less than &plusmn;1.58%, with a 54:46
duel <a href="NormTble.html">yielding</a>
confidence of victory &gt;99%, and a 60:40 duel yielding &gt;99.999999%.
At least 32 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2007#Opinion_polling#Opinion_polling">other</a>
such "Bayrou-Sarkozy duel" polls were conducted between 1 March and 21 April 2007
by many pollsters including BVA, Harris, TNS-Sofres, Ifop, and Ipsos.  <i>All 32</i> 
agreed Bayrou would defeat Sarkozy head-to-head, with Bayrou's vote share
ranging between 51% and 60%.  An Ifop 20 April poll, also age&ge;18 by telephone of
approximately 1000 pollees, also considered all three duels, and again agreed
Bayrou would defeat Royal by 58-42% and Sarkozy by 55-45%.  The combination
of all of these polls yields <i>extremely</i> high confidence, exceeding
99.99999999%, that Bayrou was
the genuine Condorcet winner.)
The <i>Figaro</i> 
poll also found the "second choices" of supporters of Bayrou, Royal, Sarkozy, and J.Le Pen,
finding the interesting result that 1-5% of voters intended in round 2 
to vote <i>against</i> their choice
in the first round.  The largest such liar-type <i>Figaro</i> found was Sarkozy voters, 5% of
whom said they intended to vote Bayrou in round 2 (if it were a Sarkozy-vs-Bayrou runoff).
Similarly 3% of Royal voters said they intended to vote Bayrou if available in 
the second round &ndash; but this was compensated by
3% of Bayrou voters who said they intended to vote Royal in the second round!

That Condorcet order was quite similar (although not exactly the same) as
</p><center>
Coombs order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Royal&gt;Besancenot&gt;Voynet&gt;Buffet&gt;Laguiller&gt;Bove&gt;de
Villiers&gt;Nihous&gt;Schivardi&gt;LePen
</center><p>
</p><center>
Pseudo-Borda order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Bayrou&gt;Royal&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Besancenot&gt;Buffet&gt;Voynet&gt;Laguiller&gt;Bove&gt;de
Villiers&gt;LePen&gt;Nihous&gt;Schivardi
</center><p>
but quite different from 
</p><center>
Instant Runoff order: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Sarkozy&gt;Royal&gt;Bayrou&gt;Besancenot&gt;LePen&gt;Buffet&gt;Laguiller&gt;Voynet&gt;de
Villiers&gt;Bove&gt;Nihous&gt;Schivardi
</center><p>
The fact that Coombs and pseudo-Borda
did not return ridiculous results is because these French 
rank-order voters evidently did not strategically/dishonestly
demote frontrunners to last or nearly-last
place.  (At least, the fraction who did, was small.)   
But that kind of "strategic burial" behavior is
very common (80-95%) in Australian rank-order voting, which would have been enough
to make both Coombs and Borda yield completely ridiculous results. <!--??cite-->
This difference between Australian and French voters is presumably due to either 
<ol type="a">
<li> 
The fact full ranking is compulsory in most of Australia, 
</li><li>
The prevalence of
party "how to vote" cards offering rank-order-advice from the Australian parties,
</li><li>
The greater experience of the Australians with rank-order voting.
</li></ol>
</p><p>
It would have been ridiculous to try to use the Borda voting system because
only 370 (38.5%) of the 960 rank-order ballots ranked all 12 candidates &ndash;
Borda would have had an insane &asymp;60% spoilage rate.  
However, one can still deduce "pseudo-Borda" scores for each candidate by using the theorem that
a candidate's Borda score is the sum of her pairwise vote-totals.
If we employ the pairwise-table below and <i>assume</i> that 
the voters who did not express "A&lt;/&gt;B" opinions would have (if forced) expressed those
opinions in the same ratios as the voters who did express an opinion about A vs. B,
then we get the pseudo-Borda score for each candidate by summing his row-numbers.

Baujard &amp; Igersheim's <i>Handbook</i> paper, and is based on an "extrapolation to all
France" of their data <i>correcting</i> for sampling and participation biases.
In 2007 the most common number to approve was 2 (done by 32.2% of all ballots), but in the
preceding 
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">2002</a> election it was 3 (by 30.3%).
<!-- and 3 (done by 23.9%). -->
Note that even the approval-winner
(Bayrou) got below 50% approval.  (And in the preceding
 <a href="FrenchStudy.html">2002</a> election, Chirac got the most approval,
with 36.7%, which was even further below 50%.)
In the ranked-ballot election, 
41% of valid ballots ranked all 12 candidates (the most common type) as the
instructions encouraged them to do;
and the second most common type were ballots ranking 3 candidates
(18.2% of valid ballots); on average ballots ranked 7.3 candidates.

<p>
Independent France-wide professional approval-style polls were conducted by IPSOS,
which indeed maintains a <a href="http://www.ipsos.fr/barometre-politique/index.php">database</a>
of favorable:unfavorable ratings for French political figures across time.
Meanwhile another pollster (BVA) on 22 March 2007 asked "would each of the following 
candidates be a good President of France?"

Baujard &amp; Igersheim also asked their voters <b>various questions about voting systems</b>,
and about 40% of them answered those questions.  Of those respondents,
83.5% said "yes" to "does the principle of approval voting seem clear to you?"
while 89.2% said yes for same question about range(0,1,2) voting.
<!--
<b>75.1%</b> opined that <b>approval</b> voting could be used for official (presidential,
legislative &amp; other) elections, versus <b>87.9%</b> for <b>range(0,1,2).</b>
-->
One particularly interesting question was #11:
</p><blockquote>
In which official elections do you think the [0,1,2 rating] method could be used?
</blockquote>
Question 12 asked the same question but for approval voting ("methode par approbation").
The answers were:

In all, among the voters who responded to the questionnaire,

<a name="australia"></a><p>
This is among the first clear evidence <!--(over 6&sigma; confidence on both!)-->
that score voting [more precisely, range(0,1,2)]
actually is both more popular and comprehensible than approval voting!!
It also is less-clear evidence that score and approval voting are "adoptible"
and apparently would win by a massive margin if given as an option on a referendum.
These conclusions unfortunately are attackable because only 40% of the pollees answered these
optional questions and hence there may have been self-selection bias.

In contrast,  an October 2010 nationwide professional telephone 
<a href="AustraliaNewsPollVoteStudy.pdf">poll</a>
of 1202 
random Australian adults found that they prefer plain-plurality voting 
versus the preferential (instant runoff) system they presently use to elect their House. 
If forced to choose one, they'd choose to <b>abandon IRV</b> &ndash;
the poll's
result was <b>57% to 37%</b> (with 5% don't know/refuse).
Also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011">Britain</a>
conducted a binding referendum on 5 May 2011 asking voters to decide whether 
the UK should switch from plurality to IRV voting, resulting in a massive landslide
victory (<b>68% to 32%</b> of the 19.3 million votes) 
for "stay with plurality."  Another big referendum defeat for IRV
was on 12 May 2009 in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_electoral_reform_referendum,_2009">British Columbia</a>, 
Canada, where "switch to IRV" got only
39.09% of the 1.65 million votes.

There also were France-wide
pre-election polls by a number of polling agencies agreeing Bayrou
would have defeated every rival in a head to head "Bayrou versus X" election
(some <a href="#duels">already</a> discussed).
</P>
<!--
According to a nationwide IPSOS poll ending 21 April, Bayrou would have beaten Sarkozy in a 
head-to-head (i.e. potential second-round) election by 52.5% to 47.5%, and this conclusion 
was true no matter what time the poll was taken from early March until late April. 
According to a CSA poll ending 20 April, a head-to-head Sarkozy v. Royal matchup &ndash;
which in fact happened and Sarkozy won  &ndash;
would be a tossup (50%-50%), while the IFOP poll (also ending 20 April) gave a 51-49 edge to 
Sarkozy. 
The IFOP poll also indicated Bayrou would have beaten Sarkozy 55-45 head to head, and 
Bayrou would have beaten Royal 58-42 head-to-head. At least 9 other 
polls also examined a possible Bayrou-Sarkozy runoff and all also concluded Bayrou would win it.

<p><b>Pairwise table from Balinski &amp; Laraki's Majority-Judgment study:</b>
</p>
<img src="BLpairwise22AprilOrsay.png" alt="Pairwise table from MJ study"/>



<p><b><a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">IRV paradoxes</a> that occurred in this election:</b>
</p><ol><li>
Royal was a "spoiler." That is, with IRV as the voting 
method the winner was Sarkozy, but if Royal had dropped out
of the race, then the IRV winner would have been Bayrou.
</li><a name="nonmono"></a><li>
Was this election "<a href="Monotone.html">nonmonotonic</a>"?  Almost certainly.
According to 
Farvaque, Jayet &amp; Ragot's table 3, the final three candidates in IRV were
Bayrou, Royal, and Sarkozy.
Bayrou was eliminated
with 27.4% of the (still active) ballots versus Royal's 32% and Sarkozy's 40.5%.
Then, in the final IRV round, Sarkozy beat Royal 54.15% to 45.85%.
Note that Royal got a 13.85% boost (from 32% to 45.85%)  due to vote-transfers from Bayrou,
whereas Sarkozy received a slightly smaller transfer of 13.65%.  This small advantage 
in transfers was not enough for Royal to win.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Assume 
&ge;4.61% of the total number of voters ranked the "big three" in the order
Royal&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Bayrou.
(Because 4.61 is a small percentage, this assumption seems extremely likely to be true;
but I cannot be certain of it without access to 
Farvaque, Jayet &amp; Ragot's raw data.)
<!-- the percent ranking
Royal>Sarkozy is known, about 46.9% official 2nd round.
The percent ranking Sark>Bayrou is 48.0
The percent ranking Royal>Bayrou is 39.9.
-->
Now consider the effect of such a 4.61% <i>switching</i> their vote 
from Royal to Sarkozy.  In that case, Royal would have been eliminated.
The final round would then have been Bayrou versus Sarkozy.   
According to the head-to-head pairwise data table, Bayrou would have beaten Sarkozy
in this final round 52.0-48.0 (and those promotions of Sarkozy to top in
those 4.61% would not have changed this at all).
That's <b>non-monotonicity</b>: 
if about 1.8 million "Royal&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Bayrou" 
voters had switched their vote from Royal
to the winner Sarkozy, that would have made Sarkozy <i>lose</i>!
</li><li>
Another paradox IRV suffered in this election was a <b>no-show paradox.</b>
Suppose that 1.8 million
Royal&gt;Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy voters &ndash; who, we reiterate, 
ranked Sarkozy dead last &ndash; had simply "not shown up" i.e. had chosen not to thus-vote
against Sarkozy.   That would have made Bayrou win.  We repeat: the act of voting Sarkozy 
dead last, <i>made him win</i>, entirely against the expressed interests of these voters.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, not quite.
Actually, this paradox does not quite work as stated, but it does work 
<!--
if we view ballots leaving Sarkozy <i>unranked</i> as ranking him "co-equal last."
(That is IRV's official policy.)  It also works
-->
in combination
with the above non-monotonicity paradox, e.g. erase 1.4 million 
Royal&gt;Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy voters ("no show") plus make 0.4 million
Royal&gt;Sarkozy&gt;Bayrou voters switch to
Sarkozy&gt;Royal&gt;Bayrou ("non-monotonicity") &ndash; 
that <i>combination</i> paradoxically causes Sarkozy to lose.
<br><blockquote><small>
Again, this conclusion is attackable since our argument only works if &ge;1.4 million
Royal&gt;Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy voters actually <i>existed.</i>
They probably did, but I reiterate am not 100% sure they did since I do not have access to
Farvaque, Jayet &amp; Ragot's raw data (which they did not provide when I asked for it).
</small></blockquote>
</li></ol>
<p>
In this IRV election, approximately 4% of the IRV voters with unspoiled ballots
failed to affect the final 
Sarkozy vs. Royal round (because, e.g, they had failed to rank either) &ndash; plus
7.0% of the ballots were spoiled, so in all about 11% of the IRV voters failed to
have any impact on the final Sarkozy vs Royal round.  That considerably exceeds
the Sarkozy-vs-Royal victory margin.  In the official election (2-round plurality voting)
however, the spoilage rates were well below the S-vs-R victory margin.  
This means that the official 2-round 
<i>non</i>instant runoff, in this case, had a greater claim to 
<b>legitimacy</b> than an instant runoff would have had (even though they
both delivered the same winner, Sarkozy).
</p>
<p><b>Strategic voting:</b>
A TNS-Sofres-Unilog Groupe Logica CMG poll conducted on election day (22 April 2007) 
asked voters what most determined their votes.
One of the seven possible answers was a deliberate strategic vote for somebody who was not their 
favorite ("le vote utile"): this answer was given by 
<b>
22% of those (who said they voted) for Bayrou, 
10% of those for Le Pen, 
31% of those for Royal, and 
25% of those for Sarkozy.
</b>
</p>
<a name="aboutMJ"></a>
<p>
<b>Correction for geographic bias in Balinski &amp; Laraki's "Majority Judgment"</b> 
median-based score-voting method:
although their full 1733-voter
sample elected Bayrou, B&amp;L believed their sample was geographically biased
since region they polled (Orsay)
preferred Royal and Bayrou more, and Sarkozy less, than the rest of France:
</p>
<pre>
                               <b>Official vote-percentages</b>
                   Sark Royl Bay LePen Bes Vil Voy Bov Buf Lag Nih Sch
        <b>Orsay12</b>    32.0 26.6 20.2 10.0 2.7 2.5 2.3 1.3 1.2 0.8 0.2 0.0 
        <b>Nationwide</b> 31.2 25.9 18.6 10.4 4.1 2.2 1.9 1.6 1.3 1.3 1.2 0.3
</pre>
And hence really, B&amp;L speculated that 
all France using the MJ voting method probably would have elected Sarkozy.
They attempted to correct for this bias, while also producing interesting results, as
follows.
They first extracted (by use of weighted randomness) 
a subsample of 501 ballots from their 1733-ballot set,
using a weighting based on that ballot's favorite candidate, with the intent of causing the 501 to
be more-representative of all France than their original (geographically biased) 1733.
This attempt succeeded &ndash; the 501 was indeed more representative of all France,
especially about the top three candidates (it was however, worse than Orsay-12 as regards Le Pen):
</p>
<pre>
                               <b>Official vote-percentages</b>
                   Sark Royl Bay LePen Bes Vil Voy Bov Buf Lag Nih Sch
        <b>The 501</b>    30.7 25.9 18.7  9.3 2.5 (difference less than 0.6)
        <b>Nationwide</b> 31.2 25.9 18.6 10.4 4.1 2.2 1.9 1.6 1.3 1.3 1.2 0.3
</pre>
<p>
They then extracted a uniform-random subsample of 201 ballots from their 501-ballot 
France-representative master set,
and recorded who won within those 201 ballots according to each voting method.
Then they repeated that experiment 10000 times in all.  
The result was this very
interesting table of win-counts (this is from page 50 of Dolez et al):
</p><pre>
     <u><b>VOTE METHOD..................Royal......Bayrou.....Sarkozy.....Tie....Sum</b></u>
     Plain Plurality...............977..........0.........<b>9022</b>........5....10004
     2-round(official) system.....1146.........98.........<b>8197</b>......559....10000
     Approval(&ge;"very good")........467........658.........<b>7947</b>......928....10000
     <b>Majority Judgment</b>.............606.......4326.........<b>5065</b>........3....10000

     Point Summing(i.e. Range).....139.......<b>9463</b>..........239......159....10000
     Borda Count....................12.......<b>9976</b>............0.......12....10000

*Also there were 114 Condorcet cycles, which B&amp;L regard as a separate category from "tie."
</pre>
<p>
Note the win-counts in each 
row of the table should sum to 10000, except for the "Condorcet" row which sums to 9986=10000-114.
Unfortunately, this sum=10000 condition is (slightly) violated in two cases, indicating
B&amp;L's computer program had minor "bugs"!
(Also, it would have been better to use subsample size&ge;251, not 201.)
Note that even within B&amp;L's corrected-to-unbias 501-sample,
there still remains <i>slight</i> pro-Bayrou and anti-Sarkozy bias.
Nevertheless in this experiment B&amp;L found
<i>Sarkozy</i> had a greater win-probability (using MJ) than Bayrou.
So, MJ <i>France-wide</i> 
should really be regarded as "electing either Sarkozy or Bayrou, with greater
chance that it was Sarkozy" or perhaps even just "Sarkozy, full stop"
in this election.   That "judgment" agrees with the official result but
<i>differs</i> from approval, average-based range voting,
Condorcet, and Borda.

Coombs, pseudo-Borda, and Condorcet &ndash; and pre-election head-to-head polls also indicated
&ndash; that <b>Bayrou</b> was the candidate 
France wanted, and would have defeated every rival head-to-head.
But the instant-runoff, non-instant top-2-runoff, and plain plurality  election systems
(and probably post-correction median score) would have elected (and did elect)
<b>Sarkozy</b>.  This was a failure of democracy which France in 
retrospect (based on <a href="France2012.html">later</a>
polls and elections) appears to have regretted. <!--cite?? -->
</li><li>
Rank-order ballots exhibit the largest (7.0%) spoilage rates (which would be an enormous
60% if used for Borda).   
Approval-style ballots exhibit the smallest (0.8%)  spoilage rates.
Score voting ballots have 1.1% spoilage rate,
while the official spoilage rates using plurality-style ballots were 1.44 and 4.20%.
</li><li>
Balinski &amp; Laraki's "Majority Judgment" median-based 
score-voting method clearly worked less well
in this election than the simpler "greatest average wins"  score voting method
(because MJ probably elected Sarkozy after correction for geographic biases, 
as B&amp;L themselves 
<a href="#aboutMJ">showed</a>; while average elected Bayrou).
