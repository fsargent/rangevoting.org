For your convenience this entire proposal is available <i>online</i>, 
with about 90 live hyperlinks to supporting documents, at 
<a href="BC2018.html">/BC2018.html</a>.
</small></p>

<p>
<b>Our proposal:</b>
Keep British Columbia's current regional constituency system, but change the ballot from 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting to 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting, or its simplest form
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting,
to determine the winners.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We further advise that all member votes inside the Assembly with more than two options, 
<i>also</i> be conducted with approval or score.
This would be particularly useful for electing a Premier 
and leader of the Opposition from among the members. And if this or future BC
referendums offer more than 2 options, it too should be conducted
with approval or score &ndash; which would have the advantage of helping
educate voters about the process being proposed.

<h3> Definitions </h3>

<p><b><a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> voting</b> (also called "first past the post"):
your vote is "name one candidate."  The
most-named one wins.
Example vote:  "Trudeau."
</p><p><b><a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> voting:</b>
your vote is "approve or disapprove each candidate."
The most-approved one wins.
Example vote: "Approve Trudeau &amp; Harper, disapprove Mulroney &amp; Chretien."
</p><p><b><a href="RangeVoting.html">Score</a> voting</b> (also called "range voting"):
your vote is "award each candidate a score from 0=bad to 9=good."
<!--You can also leave one or more candidates intentionally unscored.
The candidate with the greatest average wins.
(A voter who leaves Harper unscored will not alter his average.)
Example vote: "Trudeau=9, Harper=9, Mulroney=3, Chretien=0, Martin=unscored."-->
The candidate with greatest average wins.
Example vote: "Trudeau=9, Harper=9, Mulroney=3, Chretien=0."
</p><p>
Plurality voting is the (poor) system BC currently uses.
Score voting could in principle be used with any pre-agreed set 
of numerical score-levels,
but we prefer the single digits {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} for simplicity and
because this was found popular in 
<a href="RateScaleResearch.html">studies</a>.
Approval voting essentially <i>is</i> score voting
when there are only two allowed scores (1=approve, 0=disapprove).
</p><p>
There also exist (but we shall not advocate)
more-complicated systems based on <i>rank-ordering</i> ballots.
We mention, without defining, these two:
</p><ul><li>
Instant runoff voting, <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>. 
<!--is the most common method for aggregating scores  ??-->
</li><li>
For electing <i>multiple</i> winners,
IRV can be expanded into "single transferable vote" 
(<a href="assets/documents/TidemanSTVJEconPersp195.pdf">STV</a>) schemes,
some of which enjoy PR (proportional representation) theorems.
</li></ul>

<a name="typthink"></a>
<h3> Typical voter's thinking process with Approval voting</h3>

<p>
First, approve your favourite and disapprove your most-disliked candidate.
Now, as far as the remaining candidates are concerned,
the question is where to draw your personal "dividing line" between the 
"approved" and "disapproved" ones.
</p><p>
Suppose you were voting in the 
<b>USA 2000</b> presidential election. The top three contenders were 
G.Bush (Republican), A.Gore (Democrat), and R.Nader (Green).
It was thought that Nader, with about 1% of the funding,
was unlikely to win despite his excellent qualifications.
</p><ul><li>
If Nader is your favourite, approve him.  But if you agree Nader is unlikely to win,
then you probably <i>also</i> should approve your least-disliked among {Bush,Gore} 
so your vote can affect their battle.
</li><li>
If Gore is your favourite, approve him. Now (assuming he is your 2nd choice): 
should you also approve Nader?
That would be a mistake if it comes down to a Gore vs. Nader battle,
but a smart move if it comes down to Bush vs. Nader.
If (as expected) the crux battle is Gore vs. Bush, then it does not matter 
whether you approve Nader &ndash; so act honestly.
</li><li>
What if Nader is your most-disliked among the three?  Then approve only <i>one</i> 
of {Gore,Bush}.
</li></ul>
<p>
So in this election, you probably would approve, on average,
about 1&frac12; among these 3 candidates.
</p>

<a name="advant"></a>
<h3> Advantages of Score (and Approval) versus Plurality &amp; other systems</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Ludicrously, with plurality ballots, 
voters are forced to provide the
<i>least</i> possible information &ndash;
A better democracy should allow voters to provide
<b><i>more</i> information</b>.
With approval, they provide 1 bit 
of information <i>per candidate</i>.
With score ballots, even more information: quantitatively <i>how much</i> 
they like/dislike each candidate.
</li><li>
Plurality encourages even the absurdly small amount of information each voter gives,
to be <b>false</b>.
E.g. in USA 2000, polling showed <i>over 90%</i> of the
voters who honestly thought the Green Party's Ralph Nader was the best candidate,
voted (dishonestly) for somebody else.  That's because they thought Nader had 
<i>little chance to win</i>, and did not want to "waste" their vote.  
A good democracy should not force such enormous numbers of
voters to lie, and should not force parties such as the Greens to
overcome such enormous (more than 10 to 1!)  artificial obstacles.
With approval and score,
a voter's score for candidate C in no way affects the battle between A vs. B. 
Hence, you can give your honest opinion of C 
without fear of "wasting your vote" or hurting A.
You <i>never</i> have an incentive to
"betray" your favourite candidate by
giving a higher score to a candidate you like less.
(But unfortunately with STV, IRV, and plurality, favourite-betrayal 
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">often</a>
<i>is</i> strategically forced.)
There is no longer any 
built-in penalty for approving a third-party candidate.
</li><li>
The decreased importance of "convincing voters you have good chances to <i>win</i>"
(which is expensive), as opposed to "convincing them you are <i>good</i>"
(comparatively cheap)
should decrease the importance of <b>money</b>.
Which is good because money corrupts.
</li><li>
Consider the situation where A has "<b>clones</b>" 
A<sub>2</sub> and  A<sub>3</sub>.
In the old 
plurality system, the clones "split the vote" and both lose.
That's especially crazy in a situation where either clone by himself
would have won, but his very <i>popularity</i> causes the cloning,
which makes him lose.
With score voting, A is neither harmed nor 
helped by the presence of clones.  "<b>Vote splitting</b>" no longer exists.
</li><li>
Plurality, IRV, and STV
each have, at least in some countries (USA, Australian House, Malta) yielded
massive <b>2-party domination</b> which quite probably (since self-reinforcing) is
permanent.  That's a sad fate for any democracy
because the diversity of human thought is greatly diminished by
being pigeonholed into exactly two boxes with no other possible
views permitted to hold power.  We doubt the USA's environment
benefited by never permitting any Green Party member to hold a federal seat.
There are good reasons (both <a href="#histexp">historical</a>, 
<a href="NESD.html">theoretical</a>, 
and based on data from polls employing these methods) 
to suspect that Approval
and especially Score can avoid that trap.
<blockquote>
"There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the 
republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, 
and concerting measures in opposition to each other. 
This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the 
greatest political evil under our Constitution."
<br> &ndash; 
John <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams">Adams</a>, 
Letter to Jonathan Jackson (2 October 1780; reprinted in
<i>Works of John Adams</i>, vol. 9, p.511.)
</blockquote>
</li><li>
More parties with more 
chances also should increase voter interest and hence <b>turnout.</b>
</li><li>
Score and especially approval are very <b>simple</b>.  Indeed, when you think about it,
approval arguably is <i>simpler</i> than plurality voting, because there is no longer any
special extra step needed to detect and discard illegal "overvotes."
And indeed, polling 
<a href="SPRates.html">studies</a> have found lower <b>"spoiled ballot" rates</b> 
for voters using approval than plurality ballots.  
(Ranked ballots have the worst rates; plurality the second-worst;
score better; and approval the best.)
That's important <a href="Spoiled.html">because</a>
some corrupt election managers have 
intentionally encouraged voters to makes ballot-spoiling mistakes in some locales
but not others, thus trying to bias the election.
Although score might justifiably be thought more complicated than approval, 
timing experiments
have shown voters actually vote <a href="REisenstadt.html#hotornot">faster</a> 
with score than approval
(preferential ballots are the slowest of all), 
and self-assessed 
<b><a href="Comprehension.html">comprehension</a></b>
in polls is actually higher for score than for approval, 
which in turn is higher than for plurality.
Score voting has also been tried successfully by 
<a href="assets/documents/ShermanPetElection.pdf">kindergartners</a>, and is used each year by
<a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a>, 
despite the relatively low mental capabilities
of both.
</li><li>
With plurality
voting, an accidental "hanging chad" or
illegible mark can cause your vote to be <b>discarded</b>.  
With range voting, it causes only <i>part</i> of your vote to get discarded
(converted to "no opinion") 
with the rest &ndash; your opinions of all the other candidates &ndash;
still operational. 
</li><li>
Both score and approval voting can be counted in <b>precincts</b> &ndash; that is,
each precinct can compute and publish a concise table of <i>subtotals</i>,
and then the central office can determine the election
results from those subtotal-tables <i>only</i>.
(That's <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">not</a>
true for IRV and STV; for them there is <i>no such thing</i> as a
"precinct subtotal.")  Precinct-countability is a good property to have
for election transparency and reliability in the face of, e.g, possible
cyberattacks and fraud conspiracies.
</li><li>
A <b>beats-all</b> (also called "Condorcet") candidate
is one who would beat every other in one-on-one races.
Counterintuitively, in many voting systems, including PR-STV and IRV,
"beats all" candidates do not necessarily prevail.
(Indeed, thanks to vote-splitting,
a "lose to all" candidate <a href="LoseAll.html">can</a> easily win with
plurality voting, which plausibly actually happened in
<a href="FunnyElections.html#nic06">Nicaragua's 2006 presidential election</a>!)
But S.Brams observed empirically that it is extremely rare for beats-all winners
not to win with approval voting.  (With score
it <a href="RandElect.html">likely</a> is even rarer.)
Why?  Well, there is a <a href="AppCW.html">theorem</a>
that, under certain assumptions about strategic voter behaviour,
a beats-all candidate (whenever one exists) always wins.
Specifically, that happens with 
<i>this</i> "assumption about voter behaviour":  voters always position
their personal "dividing line" between approved &amp; disapproved candidates,
such that, if A and B are the two candidates that voter reckons most-likely
to win, then A and B lie on opposite sides of her line; and the beats-all
and possible usurper are the two reckoned most-likely to win.
</li><li>
A voter is "pleasantly surprised" when the election winner is better
than she expected.  It is a 
<a href="PleasantSurprise.html">theorem</a>
that approval voting (also under certain assumptions about
strategic voter behaviour) maximizes the number of pleasantly surprised voters.
</li><li>
Score voting 
also reduces risk of exact and inexact election-<b>ties</b>.
</li><a name="BRreference"></a><li>
In <b>computer simulation</b> studies,
score voting was found to have the lowest 
<b>Bayesian regret (BR)</b>
among all common single-winner election methods.
<!--
(Found from massive computer simulations
for all 720 tried combinations of the following:
number V of voters and N of candidates with V>N>2, several kinds of "utility generators",
several amounts of "voter ignorance," and with either "honest" or "strategic" voters.)
-->
<a href="BayRegExec.html">BR</a> 
quantitatively measures how much your 
country's democracy suffers from using a suboptimal
election method.
We often hear that "democracy" improved over monarchy and feudalism.
But by <i>how much</i>?  
BR enables us to measure such things 
<a href="RelImport.html"><i>numerically</i></a>;
and our BR 
<a href="BayRegsFig.html"> measurements</a> suggest
that switching from plurality to score
will <a href="LivesSaved.html">cause</a> comparable or greater further improvement!
</li><li>
Computer simulations 
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">find</a> that some election methods &ndash;
notably plurality and IRV &ndash;
artificially favour <b>extremists</b>.
In contrast, approval has a pro-<b>centrist</b> bias (at least with some voter behaviours),
while score-voting has little or no discernible such bias in either direction.
</li><li>
Referenda and poll studies suggest 
<b>voters <a href="WhatVotersWant.html">want</a></b> score voting
and would enact it by landslide (&asymp;60%).  However they do <i>not</i> want various other
systems including IRV and all the systems proposed in 
<a href="CanadaVoteHistory.html">previous</a>
Canada-reform referenda.
The main reason voters rejected all those previous proposals was that they
were (i) too complicated and (ii) too great a departure from Canadian current practices.
That's why our proposal is very simple and a small change for BC.
<!--
</li><li>
Some voters feel <b>ignorant</b> about some candidate or
subset of candidates, and therefore wish to leave the decision about them
to other, better-informed, voters.  With score voting, they can do so by leaving
them <i>unscored</i>, in which case those candidates' average scores will be determined
entirely by other voters.  In contrast, with IRV or STV, candidates left unscored
are automatically ranked co-equal <i>worst</i>, which is the most extreme 
possible distortion and constitutes a severe artificial barrier for lesser-known
candidates.
-->
</li><li>
Many schemes involve <b>voting for parties</b> rather than candidates.
Or, in order to function, insist that each candidate must belong to a named party,
and/or assume that parties have certain internal structures.  We regard that
all as <i>bad</i>.  We want electoral laws to work fine even for
candidates highly atypical for their party, even if parties
self-destruct or merge, people change parties, or candidates <i>not</i>
affiliated with any party seek office.  We think one of Canada's problems
has been the lack of independent thought associated with independent MPs
and don't like proposals exacerbating that problem.
With approval and score voting, all candidates are treated the same regardless
of party (or lack of party).

<h3> Historical experience with Approval &amp; Score</h3>

<p>
Exit poll pseudo-election studies were conducted (with government funding and cooperation),
using non-plurality voting systems
such as approval, score, and IRV,
for the <b>French</b> presidential elections of
<a href="France2002.html">2002</a>,
<a href="French2007studies.html">2007</a>,
and
<a href="France2012.html">2012</a>:

<td>Chirac 1st, Le Pen 2nd</td><td>Chirac 1st (37%), Jospin 2nd (33%)</td><td>3.15</td>
<td>?</td><td>Chirac &amp; Jospin were clearly the top two with approval, but
vote-splitting pathologies put the far-right Le Pen
into the runoff instead of Jospin, whereupon he lost 82-18.
Le Pen also would have lost enormously to Jospin.</td></tr>

And almost all rank-order-ballot systems would have elected Bayrou.
But Sarkozy won both officially,
and would have won with IRV.

<p>
Large numbers of approval- and score-style pre-election polls have
been conducted in <a href="FunnyElections.html">many</a> countries,
especially <a href="RangePolls.html">USA</a>.
After having examined &asymp;100
elections in this way we are unaware of any instances where 
score voting yielded the "wrong" winner, although we do know
cases where plurality, IRV, and approval thus-failed.
It is common in such poll studies for "third party" candidates to get far 
(often a <b>factor&gt;10</b>) more
votes, relative to the top two parties, with approval than with plurality, and
with score voting it is common for them (especially the <i>smaller</i> third parties) to
get even more, <b>10&times;</b> versus approval is common.
In <a href="RangePolls.html">particular</a>
in the USA 2000 presidential election, ANES score-voting data
showed Nader actually would have <i>defeated</i> Gore, and also beaten Bush, 
in 2-man races!  
(Other score-style polls disagreed, but all agreed Nader's vote-totals 
would have been of the same order as Bush &amp; Gore's.)
In any case, officially, Nader got only 2.7%.
This demonstrates the enormous distortion plurality voting causes, which
hurts democracy.
By the end of Bush's terms his approval 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_image_of_George_W._Bush">rating</a>
hovered around 65% disapprove, 30% approve. 
Approval voting uses this common quality metric <i>to elect</i>.
In USA <a href="USA2016retro.html">2016</a>, 
the two most-approved (also highest-mean-score)
candidates were B.Sanders &amp; J.Kasich &ndash; but neither even made it out of the primaries,
causing the presidential election to be between two candidates with 
record-low approval ratings.
<!--
In retrospect the USA believed electing Bush had been a big mistake
&ndash; 
his approval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_image_of_George_W._Bush">rating</a>
near the end of his terms hovered around 65% disapprove, 30% approve.
The cost of that mistake amounted to &asymp;3 <i>trillion</i> dollars
and on the order of 1 million 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War">deaths</a>.
In USA 2016, the two most-approved (also highest-mean-score)
candidates were B.Sanders &amp; J.Kasich &ndash; but neither even made it out of the primaries,
causing D.Trump to win the presidency.
-->
</p><p>
Score voting (&infin; levels) was the method used in Ancient 
<a href="SpartaBury.html">Sparta</a>,
and 3-level Score in Renaissance 
<a href="VenHist.html">Venice</a>.
These arguably were the two longest-lasting partly-democratic states in
world history, and their success far exceeded what would a priori
have been expected.  Neither developed either 2- or 1-party domination.
</p><p>
Approval voting in single-winner districts was the method used to elect
the parliament of <a href="GreekApproval.html">Greece</a> 1864-1926.
It appeared to be developing 2-party domination toward the middle of this
period, but not at the start or end.  In particular near the end of
the Approval era Greece elected 
Eleftherios <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos">Venizelos</a>
(1864-1936), generally regarded as the greatest Greek statesman/leader 
during the last 300 years, as prime minister, <i>despite</i> the fact that
Venizelos then was leading a previously 
unempowered and unrepresented political party. 
Such a changeover would have been unthinkable in the USA or Canada
under plurality voting with 2-party domination.
Greece appears to have improved greatly during its approval-voting era.
But in 1927 it switched to a bicameral PR system and then soon self-destructed.
</p><p>
The 
<a href="UNsecyGen.html">United Nations</a>'
Secretary General is chosen by approval
voting (essentially; there were other rules too, but they seem not to have mattered).  
No party-like structures seem to have developed.
</p><p>
China's <a href="ChinaNatCong.html">National People's Congress</a> is a
multilevel hierarchical structure (levels: towns, counties, provinces, national)
which since 1979
has been elected via approval voting (each level is
elected by the preceding one, with
the bottom-level elections directly by the people).  
It is unclear how legitimate those elections have been.
But what is clear is that 1979 is precisely the year when China suddenly started dramatically
outperforming India, and indeed during 1980-2016 exhibited growth, measured by GDP/capita (PPP),
exceeding <i>every</i> other country with population&ge;2 million.
</p><p>
The Catholic <a href="https://rangevoting.org/opeSummary.html">Popes</a> were elected via
approval voting 1294-1621, but with revotes and extra nominations 
until somebody attained 2/3 supermajority approval level.
Neither 2-party domination nor 1-party centrist tyranny happened. 
There were a bunch of evolving factions mostly each trying for a permanent 
takeover to convert the papacy into a hereditary monarchy, and perfectly willing to use 
extremely corrupt methods to accomplish that. 
But the voting system successfully stopped that. 
The Papacy is the longest-lasting elected position on the face of the Earth, 
and among the religions having a central government, Catholicism has been by far the
most successful (just measured in terms of number of people 
&ndash; we are not attempting to judge the relative moral worths or 
historical helpfulness/not of different religions) and longest-lasting.
Our study of this suggests that if they had used either plurality or IRV,
the church would have self-destructed.
</p>

<a name="ExpertCons"></a>
<h3> Expert consensus </h3>

<p>
Approval is probably the least controversial voting system. 
In (an approval-style!) poll at the Du Baffy voting
procedures workshop in Normandy France July 2010, it 
was the <i>only</i> one among 18 voting systems enjoying majority-approval
among the workshop participants.
Meanwhile, plurality voting got zero approval.
</p><p>
Many professional societies of experts "put their money where their mouth is"
by enacting approval voting for their own internal elections:

Score voting is used heavily on the internet for rating movies, recipes, products, etc;

<h3> The debate: Proportional Representation versus Single Member Regional systems </h3>
<p>
Many entire books have been written about (and on both sides of)
this debate, which has raged, without resolution, for 150 years. 
We'll briefly outline what that debate <i>is</i>,
and how Approval &amp; Score voting fit into the picture.
Our main point is that many PR proponents have suffered from
a too-simplistic view, lacking a deeper understanding of to what extent and why PR
is a good thing, what its limitations are, and how to get it.
Once they <i>do</i> understand that, then they will see that our proposal, even though
<i>not</i> PR, probably gives them a great deal of what they want &ndash; and indeed helps
them more than anything else they can obtain.
</p><p><b>What they are.</b>
<ol><li>
<b>Single Member Regional</b>: 
The desire that MPs in parliament be the <i>best</i>
representative for the citizens of each constituency.
</li><li>
<b>"<i>Ideal</i> PR"</b>: the parliament should consist of the <i>same</i> sort of people &ndash;
statistically the same composition in terms of opinions/desires 
(and probably consequently representative for all genders, economic
statuses, ages, educations, skills, religions, ethnicities, etc.)
&ndash; as the electorate.
</li><li>
<b><i>Real-world</i> PR</b> (as often commonly defined): 
the parliament should mirror the <b>party composition</b> of the electorate.
</li></ol>
<p>
Goals 1&amp;2 are both good, but conflict.  
</p><ul><li>
Why is (1) good? 
Obviously, a government composed of 
the <b>best</b> people should make better decisions and be better managed.
And with each elected representative responsible for a specific community and its issues,
we enjoy a more-clear division of responsibility, and clear and direct accountability.
</li><li>
Why is (2) good?  
Because of the <b>Binary Decision Theorem</b>: whenever any yes/no decision must be made,
such a parliament would by majority vote make the <i>same</i> choice as a (usually impractical)
countrywide referendum.
</li><li>
Why do 1&amp;2 <b>conflict</b>?
Well, the ultimate in PR would be achieved by selecting the parliament
completely <i>at random</i>,
similarly to juries. (This was in fact done in Ancient Athens,
which had machines for generating the randomness.)  
Unfortunately this will yield a perfectly average parliament, <i>not</i> one
consisting of above-average people. In particular, <i>nobody would ever be re-elected</i>;
every MP would be a novice.   
Conversely, the best MPs probably have beyond-ordinary expertise.
<blockquote><small>
And indeed Ancient Athens paid the ultimate price for that.
Contemporary critics complained that sometimes the citizen panel knew 
essentially <i>nothing</i> about the matter in question.  (E.g,
if dealing with some faraway land, none knew where it was.)  So one day
the Athenians decided to declare war on Sparta.  
If their best military experts had made that decision,
they probably would have realized that Sparta was
the wrong war-opponent to have.  Sparta won and destroyed 
Athens, ending its democratic system.  However, Sparta actually had its
<a href="SpartaBury.html">own</a> interesting partly-democratic government, which
had begun before Athens, and continued after its fall.  Sparta's democracy 
was based on score voting.</small>
</blockquote>
</li></ul><p>
<b><i>Real-world</i> PR.</b>
Although many countries have employed supposedly-PR voting systems 
during the last 150 years,
none have even come close to (what we've called) "ideal PR,"
in the sense that a comparison
of the gender balance, economic situations, etc. of parliament versus
the electorate quickly reveals large differences.
The best any PR system so far has accomplished is to duplicate
the <b>party composition</b> of the electorate.  [Many PR advocates have developed
tunnel vision to the extent they think PR is
<i>about</i> parties, even <i>defining</i> it as such.
They often do not realize that <i>ideal</i> PR
is <i>not</i> about parties at all; and often do not know the Binary Theorem
which is its underlying rationale.]
Party identity alone is a very <i>crude</i> likeness 
(e.g, many voters are "70% Tory and 30% Liberal," a reality
obliterated from the picture) &ndash; <i>inadequate</i> for the Binary Theorem.
Further, basing everything on Party merely encourages partisan division rather than cooperation.
In Italy that's yielded seemingly perpetual gridlock and oscillation.
</p><p>
Further, in many cases "one" party actually consists of two or more subfactions.
PR systems based on named parties do <i>not</i> even try to proportionally
represent such subfactions.  While <i>candidate</i>-based PR systems could accomplish that,
they depend on multiwinner districts, most commonly 3-winner,
which only yields very crude approximate proportionality 
(fractions rounded to 0, 33%, 67%, or 100%).  More winners could be employed,
but then the ballots become cumbrously large, e.g. with 10 winners
there might be 70 candidates.
</p><p>
<b>The debate:</b>
which is a better kind of democracy &ndash; single-winner-based, or PR-based?
Attempts have been made to settle this debate by comparing the two kinds
of countries using economic and health statistics... with many such
comparisons later being (justifiably) attacked... but to make a long story
short we <a href="PropRep.html">feel</a>
that, so far, no clear and convincing statistics-based case
has been made for the superiority of either side of the debate.
Further, even supposing that in the future (with more statistics) 
some demonstration of PR's superiority <i>could</i> be produced, 
then considering that the single-winner countries mainly used (the poor) 
plurality or occasionally 
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">IRV</a> 
systems instead of (the superior) score voting system, 
there then still would be plenty of room to suspect
that <i>improved</i> single-winner systems could be superior to PR.
</p><p>
<b>Our feeling:</b> 
</p><ol type="i"><li>
PR systems are usually <b>complicated</b> and/or <b>party-based</b>, 
while our improved single-winner proposal here is <i>simple</i> and <i>candidate-based</i>.
</li><li>
Every Canada voting-reform referendum 2000-2018 has 
<a href="CanadaVoteHistory.html">failed</a>,
with the main reason being <i>complexity</i> &ndash; to the extent that 2/3 or 3/4 of
referendum voters told pollsters they knew essentially <i>nothing</i> about the proposal!
</li><li>
We need to stop failing for the same reason in the same way every time.
Instead, learn from this.  Ask BC whether it would like the simple
and clear improvement of switching to approval or score.
Both are so simple that they 
<b>can and should be completely <a href="#defns">defined</a> within
the wording of the referendum question.</b>
No place, ever, has asked that referendum question before.
But there is poll <a href="WhatVotersWant.html">data</a> suggesting that
if anybody ever did bother to ask, then approval (and especially) score
voting would be enacted, the latter even by a large margin.
</li><li>
Neither score nor approval voting (nor IRV, nor BC's present plurality system)
are PR.  You can see that by considering an election featuring 51% Red voters.  
It is entirely mathematically possible, with any of these systems,
for the Reds to win 100% of the seats &ndash; severe disproportionality.
</li><li>
So if Approval or Score are enacted, we expect
sometimes disproportional, and sometimes more proportional, results.
But <i>overall</i>, the results should become <i>more</i> proportional than 
now, because small parties no longer are greatly artificially handicapped.
</li><li>
Our proposal thus improves BC with respect to <i>both</i> desires (1) &amp; (2) 
simultaneously &ndash; giving PR proponents 
a lot of what they want while keeping the advantages of single-member regionality.
</li></ol>
Most importantly, the change we propose will <b>lay the groundwork</b>
for a possible later switch to a truly-PR system (if then deemed desirable).  
That's because 
<a href="RRV.html">several</a>
<a href="Asset.html">good</a>
<a href="QualityMulti.html">PR</a>
<a href="CanadaOverview.html">systems</a>, 
superior to most ever used in past history and also superior to
all prior failed Canada-reform-proposals, already exist
that are <i>based</i> on approval or score-style ballots.
<blockquote>
Just one example of that superiority: with STV,
giving a candidate a better score can <i>hurt</i>
him.  Such 
"<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a>"
happens 5 to 16% of the 
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html#SummTable">time</a>
in 3-candidate 1-winner elections.
With such better PR systems as 
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> or 
"<a href="QualityMulti.html">harmonic voting</a>," 
that problem cannot arise.
</blockquote>
If PR-advocates foolishly try to get PR immediately, 
they will fail again (in the same way for the same reason they always fail),
hurting their cause by making them look incompetent.
But if they, more productively,
seek score voting now, then they will get a substantial and clear improvement
in quality of democracy, plus also making things more PR than now,
plus also <i>enabling a future victory</i> with a future PR system <i>better</i> than 
those they currently know about.

<h3> How large an improvement are we talking about? </h3>
<p>
Any country or province that enacts score voting will over time accrue large 
(e.g. economic) advantages versus rivals.
As we already 
<a href="#BRreference">said</a>, based
on computerized BR measurements, Score's advantage versus Plurality
is comparable to the improvement
humanity experienced by <i>inventing</i> democracy.
How large is that?
Compare Canada versus (say) Pakistan and Russia.
All were about the same, economically
and geographically speaking, 300 years ago.  
But over those 300 years (and right now), Canada was much more democratic.  
The result: present-day
Canadian GDP/capita is US$42517, while for Pakistan it is US$1468 and Russia US$8748.

<h3> About the authors, and how this came to be </h3>

<p>
Keith M. Edmonds is a BC resident. He has a PhD in physics and is employed as a data scientist.
Warren D. Smith is CRV co-founder (PhD applied maths).
After Dr. Edmonds wrote a proposal for BC in Feb. 2018 he was told individuals
were not supposed to submit them, organizations were; so then he
contacted CRV and this document resulted.
