<H2> "Two and a half" candidates </H2>

<p>
The problem with a lot of voting systems such as 
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>, 
<a href="rangeVborda.html">IRV</a>, 
and (albeit to a somewhat lesser extent)
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>
is that they were really invented by the following flawed process:
</P>

<ol>
<li>
Realize that <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting, while it works well if there are <i>two</i> candidates,
often performs badly if there are more.
</li><li>
Consider the case of two main candidates A &amp; B, plus an additional "half" a candidate C,
that is, a third candidate who has not enough support
to have any hope of winning, but enough so that he, by distortionary
effects like the "spoiler" and "vote splitting" and <a href="CandCloning.html">cloning</a>
pathologies, sometimes can swing the A versus B election
in a harmful and annoying way.
</li><li>
Try to invent a  new voting system that performs well in these 
"two and a half" candidate elections.
</li><li>
Proclaim success.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The problem here is the final step "proclaim success."
That was not justified.  Really, you need to go further by considering the <i>full</i>
set of scenarios with <b>three</b>, not two-and-a-half, candidates.
E.g. situations where you no longer are allowed to pre-suppose that the third candidate never
has a chance to win.  
</p>

<p>
In that case, you quickly see that IRV and Borda no longer are much good and
<a href="IRVpartic.html">still</a> suffer from spoiler and lesser-evil pathologies (plus more,
e.g. IRV suffering from 
<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a>
and winner=loser <a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal failures</a>,
and Borda suffering weird effects
when you eliminate
<a href="rangeVborda.html#JohnsonEx">&quot;irrelevant loser&quot;</a> candidates). 
Condorcet <a href="IncentToExagg.html">also suffers</a> from
these.
There are also
<a href="AddTopFail.html#Rouse">honest voting can hurt you</a> paradoxes.
</p>
<p>
Even better, we should even go further still and
start to consider <b>three-and-a-half</b>
candidate situations.  We then encounter the horrific 
<a href="DH3.html">DH3 pathology</a>
afflicting Borda and Condorcet.
</p>

<p>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> performs
well throughout the whole space of three-and-a-half 
candidate situations
and is immune to DH3, favorite-betrayal, spoiler, cloning, vote-splitting,
monotonicity-failure, and honest-voting-hurts
effects.
