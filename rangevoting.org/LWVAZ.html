<H1> Open Letter to League of Women Voters of Arizona </H1>

<p>
Dear <a href="http://www.lwvaz.org/">League of Women Voters of Arizona</a>.
[ph. 480.966.9031;
address 4423 N. 24th St, Suite 500
Phoenix, AZ 85016]
</p><p align="right">
From Warren D. Smith (former president, Center for Election Science, and PhD
in applied math, and voting methods researcher &ndash; but I speak for
myself not the <a href="http://electology.org">CES</a>). 20 March 2013.
</p>

<p>
I would like you to support, not oppose, Arizona bill <a href="Arizona2013.html">HB2518</a>, 
which allows
(but does not force) Arizona cities and towns, if they so choose, to switch to using
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> in their open primaries, followed by a later general
election contested by the top 2 finishers in the primary.
</p><p>
Approval voting has long been championed by political scientists and
voting reformers.  It is: each voter votes for any and all the
candidates she approves.
She is not restricted to "name one candidate then shut up" voting,
also called the
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
system.  The latter system, which the USA is unfortunately
afflicted with, is well known by voting methods researchers to be one
of the worst available voting systems.  HB2518 is a groundbreaking
opportunity for improvement and it is a tremendous mistake for the LWV
to stand in the way of, rather than advocating, such an improvement.
This is your chance. NYU politics professor S.J.Brams has
spent his entire life trying to get statehouses to pass approval
voting bills, with only partial successes so far where one statehouse but not the 
other passed it.
Do not dismiss this opportunity lightly.
</p><p>
To learn more about approval voting and why it is used by a ton of
professional organizations such as 
American Mathematical Society, 
the Public Choice Society,
Institute of Management Science and Operations Research,
Mathematical Association of America,
American Statistical Association,
Social Choice and Welfare Society, 
Econometric Society, etc, see
<a href="Approval.html">/Approval.html</a>
and read book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Approval-Voting-Steven-J-Brams/dp/3764331240">Approval Voting</a>
by S.Brams &amp; P.Fishburn (Birkhauser, Boston 1983).
</p><p>
Those organizations are not doing this because they are idiots.
They include, in fact, the top organizations in the area of voting methods research
&amp; publication and they've used these methods in many cases over 25 years in 
their own elections.
</p><p>
Even better might be <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>, which the current HB2518
unfortunately does not enact. You could play a beneficial role by urging that HB2518 also
include score voting.
See
<a href="http://scorevoting.net">http://scorevoting.net</a>
which is a website containing over 1000 subpages about voting methods.
Score voting has been used for over <a href="OlympHist.html">1000 years</a> 
in some of the longest lasting  governments in world history
and for millions of years by <a href="ApisMExec.html">honeybees</a>
(the world's first and foremost
democrats).  It has been 
<a href="Endorse.html">endorsed</a> by over 100 people including several US presidential 
candidates.
</p><p>
Computer <a href="BayRegExec.html">simulations</a>
by me discussed on this website indicate that if
the world switched from plurality to score voting, the gain would be
comparable to the gain got by adopting democracy in the first place
(from, e.g, Monarchy).  That is a very big win for humanity.  For a
very small change.  It could literally save the world.
</p><p>
If I am wrong (and I'm not), a few towns in Arizona may suffer, but
they could always change their voting systems back if so.  If I am
right, it could start a movement that could literally save the world.
I suggest therefore that you
<i>take this seriously</i>.
I've been spending over a decade of my life trying to make this sort of voting reform happen
and began an international organization to do it.
</p><p>
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant runoff voting</a>
is unfortunately a rather poor method and has led to
a lot of problems.  It is more <a href="NCIRVrules.html">complex</a>
than approval and score.  It cannot
be counted in <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">precincts</a>.
It cannot be counted with most voting machines.
It has often led to <a href="MinneapolisIRV13.html">cost</a> increases.  
The ballots cannot be published
without violating voter privacy. It often leads to large increases in
voter error rates
(whereas approval and score <a href="SpoilExec.html">decrease</a> voter error rates).
It has a lot of embarrassing <a href="CompleteIdioticIRV.html">pathologies</a> such as 
<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a>
where increasing your vote for X causes X to lose, while giving X a
worse vote causes X to win(!); and 
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal failure</a>
where if the voters reverse all their votes trying to chooose the <i>worst</i>
rather than best candidate the <i>same</i> "winner" results!
Such pathologies occurred in <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a>'s 
2009 instant runoff election
whereupon Burlington repealed it.  They occurred in Aspen, then Aspen
repealed it.
A giant list of such pathologies and their frequencies of occurrence
are given here:
<A href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">/IrvParadoxProbabilities.html</a>.
</p><p>
Another important reason instant runoff would be a bad idea for Arizona is it is unconstitutional.
If it were put in the law it would be overthrown by court challenge.
That is, Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/Constitution.asp">constitution</a> 
(VII.10 &amp; 17)
demands <i>separate</i> primaries and general election. 
The whole point of "instant" runoff is to combine these into one.
In fact there are 
<a href="TTRexec.html">reasons</a>
to believe
this combining would be a bad idea even in
places it is constitutional.
</p><p>
In view of this I recommend approval and score voting, but not instant runoff, for
Arizona.
</p><p>
The current version of HB2518 does not enact instant runoff, but there
has been a threat to amend it to implement it.
</p><p>
There is a popular science book <a href="PoundstoneRev.html">Gaming the Vote</a>
by William Poundstone (2008) which
discusses a lot of voting methods science.  I'm one of those he interviewed for that book.
</p><p>
Important points:
<ol><li>
HB2518 does not force anyplace in Arizona to change systems.  It
merely allows them to change to approval, if they want.
</li><li>
HB2518 only applies to Arizona's "open primaries" which (as far as
I can tell) every town+city in Arizona except Tucson currently uses.
Their systems would be unchanged
except for replacing plurality with approval voting in round 1.
Tucson would also
be free to change to this system, but only if it adopted open
primaries instead of their present system of many, not one,
closed-party primaries.  That is something
Tucson may or may not want to do, but they are merely offered the
option by HB2518,
not forced.

If you wish to discuss this, please phone or email me.  This is an exciting reform opportunity.
