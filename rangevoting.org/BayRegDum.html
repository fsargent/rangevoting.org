<H1> "Bayesian Regret for dummies" </H1>

<p>
<a href="BayRegExec.html">(Executive Summary)</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Q.</b> I was asked to explain "Bayesian regret" and
why (at least in my view) it is the "gold standard"
for comparing single-winner election methods.
</p>

<p>
<a href="BayRegMath.html">Mathematical definition</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Oversimplified into a nutshell:</b>
The "Bayesian regret" of an election method E is 
the "expected avoidable human unhappiness"
caused by using E.
</p>

<p>
<b>More precise answer:</b>
Bayesian regret is gotten via this <i>procedure</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter has a personal
"utility" value for the election of each candidate.
(E.g., if Nixon is elected, then voter Dan Cooper will
acquire -55 extra lifetime happiness units.)
In a computer simulation, the "voters" and "candidates" are artificial,
and the utility numbers are generated by 
some randomized "utility generator" and assigned
artificially to each candidate-voter pair.
</li>
<li>
Now the voters vote, based both on their private utility
values, and (if they are strategic voters)
on their perception from "pre-election polls"
(also generated artificially within the simulation, e.g. from
a random subsample of "people") of how
the other voters are going to act.
<br><font size="-1">(Note.  Some people here have gotten the wrong impression
that this is assuming that voters will be "honest" or that we are
assuming that honest range voters
will use candidate-utilities as their candidate-scores.  
Other people thought we insisted on i.i.d. normal random numbers as utility values [or that
some other specific randomized utility generator was insisted upon].
All those impressions are incorrect;
these assumptions are not made.)</font>
</li>
<li>
The election system E elects some winning candidate W.
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for W, is
the "achieved societal utility."
</li>
<li>
The sum over all voters V of their utility for X,
<i>maximized</i> over all candidates X, is
the "optimum societal utility" which would have been
achieved if the election system had magically chosen the 
societally best candidate.
</li>
<li>
The difference between 5 and 4 is the "Bayesian Regret"
of the election system E, at least in this experiment.
It might be zero, but if E was bad or if this election was unlucky for E, then
it will be positive because W and X will be different candidates.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
We now redo steps 1-6 a zillion times
(i.e. running a zillion simulated elections) to find the
<i>average Bayesian regret</i> of election system E.

<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
The Bayesian regret of an election system E may differ if we
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vary the number of voters, 
</li>
<li>
Vary the number of candidates, 
</li>
<li>
Vary the kind of "utility generator" (e.g. could be based on different numbers of "issues"
with different methods for generating the locations of the candidates in "issue space"),
</li>
<li>
Use different kinds of assumed "voter strategy" (possibly including "honesty"), 
and/or try different mixes of honest &amp; strategic voters in the pool, or 
</li>
<li>
Put different amounts of "voter ignorance". 
</li>
</ol>
To describe the last concept: we can put in
voter ignorance by artificially adding random noise to the
voter's private utility values, and then having the voter act
based on those <i>distorted</i> values.  The higher the amplitude
of the noise, the more ignorance there is.  (But BR is <i>measured</i>
using the true undistorted utilities, of course.)
</p>

<p>
So there are at least 5 different "knobs" we can "turn" on our 
machine for measuring the Bayesian Regret of an election method E.
</p>

<p>
<b>Results of the computer simulation study:</b>
(paper #56 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>).
This study measured Bayesian regrets for about 30 different election methods.
720 different combinations of "knob settings" were tried.
The amazing result is that, in <i>all</i> 720 scenarios, range voting
was the best (had lowest Bayesian regret, up to statistically insignificant
noise).  We repeat: range was the best in <i>every single one</i>
of those 720 with either honest voters,
or with strategic voters.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here is a simplified table</b>
of results (from only 2 of the 720 scenarios, and only 10 of the voting systems).
(Each tabulated Bayesian regret value is an average 
over a million or more randomized simulated elections.)

<p>
Incidentally, note that with strategic voters (at least using the voting-strategy
assumed by the simulation) strategic plurality and strategic IRV seem to
be the same! That is because of the devastating
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem:</b>
Generically (i.e. if no ties),
IRV and Plurality voting with strategic voters
will yield the <i>same</i> winner in a large election:
Namely the most popular among the two
pre-election poll "frontrunners"
will always win.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
For plurality voting, this was well known: strategic voters always vote
for one of the two perceived frontrunners since other votes 
are extremely likely to be "wasted."
For IRV: we again <i>assume</i> strategic voters will rank their favorite among the two
pre-election poll "frontrunners" top, as a strategic move to maximize their vote's
impact and prevent it from being wasted.  [This assumption about strategic voter behavior
really should have been stated in the theorem statement.]
(See <a href="TarrIrv.html">this example</a>
or 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">this one</a>
to convince yourself that kind of strategy
often <i>is</i> the unique strategically-sensible vote in the IRV system
as well as many other ranked-ballot systems, and see
<a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">this<a> for data indicating the vast majority of Australian IRV
voters act this way &ndash; if &ge;75% act this way the theorem follows, but the data indicates 
80-95% act this way.)
Then the two poll-frontrunners will garner all the top-rankings from
strategic voters, thus never being eliminated until
the final round, whereupon the most popular one will win.
<!--
They consider it pointless to top-rank anybody else because that person
(they figure) has far tinier chance of winning. -->
(Note: actually the optimum strategy for IRV voting is <i>not known</i>, so my computer sim
and this here theorem are assuming the "strategic voters" use
this simple and not-always-optimum, IRV strategy, which however is usually a lot 
better than honesty, indeed see <a href="IRVStratPf.html">this mathematical proof</a>
it asymptotically <i>always</i> is optimum strategy in a random-election mathematical model
subject to certain kinds of limited voter knowledge about the others.)
QED.

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
This theorem also works for Condorcet voting (under same 
assumptions about voter behavior).

<h2> Where have we seen Bayesian regret before? </h2>
<p>
Bayesian "regret" (also called "loss")
is just the maximum possible utility minus the Bayesian "expected utility."
This is not a new concept.  It dates back to the earliest days of statistics (1800s)
and it has been used in at least a dozen papers on non-voting-related subjects.
The only thing "new" here is applying this well known concept to <i>voting methods</i>.
And that idea also was thought of by others besides me, e.g.
<a href="RVPapers.html">Merrill</a>
and
<a href="RVPapers.html">Bordley</a>.
</p>

<h2> View of bad decision-quality as a "tax" </h2>

<p>
Let's make a quick estimate to translate this into pocketbook terms.
</p><p>
Suppose thanks to a poor voting method, our elections 5% of the time make 
avoidable bad decisions.  
That has an effect analogous to a 5% tax on society.
Unlike a real tax, though, this tax does not get used for any useful purpose, it just
gets wasted.  And furthermore this is a <i>stupid</i> waste &ndash;
that could have been trivially avoided
by adopting better voting systems.  
Over time, that 5% keeps adding up and up.  After a century of annual compounding, 5% interest
would represent a multiplicative factor of 132.   That is, your country, by the trivially 
easy move of adopting
(versus not adopting) a better voting method, would under this estimate be 
<i>one hundred and thirty two</i> times richer.
If however this 5% bad-decision rate were only equivalent to a 1% tax, then
we'd only get <i>2.7 times</i> richer.  Either way, this is a massive
improvement for very little effort.
