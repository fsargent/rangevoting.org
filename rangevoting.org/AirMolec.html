<H2> Air molecules &amp; cost-benefit analysis </H2>

 we have to design for the worst case, not merely the probable.
Therefore, when designing a "room in a house" I have considered the
possibility &ndash; not forbidden by molecular dynamics &ndash; that 90% of the air
molecules will move to the other half of the room. That would probably kill
you. I demand that all rooms built from now on have safety features so you can
quickly grab an air bottle and dive into a protective hole in the floor.

but according to my calculations, that is a very improbable
event,
which will probably never occur (indeed, even 1% of the air moving will probably
never
occur) during the history of the universe. So even though your life is very
valuable
and the cost of building your safety mechanism is only $1000, the benefit
is not worth the cost. In fact, not even close.

The above laughable conversation would never happen. But yet, the exactly
analogous
conversation is going on right now in the range voting "blanks versus zeros" debate.
The "improbable event" that is likely to be avoided in our universe, is analysed
<a href="Averaging.html">here</a>.
The source of the
improbability is the
large number of air molecules (or voters) &ndash; statistics of large numbers become
near-certain,
often called the "zero-one law". But as this URL showed, even with only 100
voters
and very generous-to-my-critics assumptions, we get enormous improbability
for the "stealth candidate" bogeyman that those who hate having X-blanks in range voting,
fear.
</p>

<p>
The <i>benefit</i> of trying to rule out those nightmares-caused-by-blanks
scenarios is thus extremely <i>small</i>.
But we have to weigh that small benefit against a <i>cost</i> which is not at all small &ndash;
namely &ndash; that, say, some worse judge will get elected purely because he is
better known because he has more publicity because he has more
money because he has collected more bribes &ndash; while
his opponent gets 0s from those voters who do not know about him.
</p>

<p>
This event is not implausible. I would venture to say it has already happened
many times in the history of the universe. In fact even in the history of
just my county during the last 50 years.
</p>

<p>
Weigh the benefit of eliminating blanks against the cost.
It is not close.  Keep the X-blank option.
