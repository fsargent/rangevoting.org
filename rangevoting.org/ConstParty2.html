<H2> Just one paragraph about why Constitution Party supporters need Range Voting </H2>

<p>
The two "major" parties are no friend to the Consititution. One of those 
parties is dismantling the Bill of Rights and war powers provisions as fast 
as they can. The other party is basically going along with it. People vote 
for the "major" parties because they believe (maybe mistakenly) that they're 
the only winnable ones. But, with Range Voting, people could support a 
supposedly-needed compromise, such as the Republican, while <i>still</i> voting for 
a candidate whom they genuinely like. With Range Voting, those who prefer the 
Consititution Party candidate would feel free to give to him/her the highest 
voted rating, something that they couldn't do under the current 1-vote 
Plurality system. Range Voting will put the "alternative" parties on the 
map, and one of them will probably start winning.
