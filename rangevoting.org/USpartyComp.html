<H2> USA: Party composition of legislatures </H2>

<p>
The 2005 USA Total (for the statehouses in all 50 states) was:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ffffdd" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>
Lower houses
</td><td>
 5411 = 2708(D) + 2687(R) + 16(other) 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Senates
</td><td>
1971 =  953(D) +  964(R) + 3(other) + 1(vacant) + 1(undecided)
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
As of November 2006 (which was  later data and hence slightly different party composition), 
the "others" included:
</p>
<table bgcolor="aqua" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>
18 independent
</td><td>
6 progressive
</td><td>
1 green
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The <i>Federal</i> House in 2005 consisted of
453 total members &ndash; all of them major party except for 1 independent (Bernie Sanders).
The Federal Senate in 2005 contained
100 total, all of them major party except for 1 independent (Jeffords).
</p>
<p>
THE USA GRAND TOTAL (cheating slightly by combining
year-2005 federal with year-2006 state figures):
</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffdd" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>
7935 seats, all major party except for 
20 independent + 6(progressive) + 1(green).
</td></tr></table>

<p>
Asterisk: 
Nebraska is the only state with a unicameral legislature, and it contains only
"nonpartisans."  But we above have <i>not</i> counted them as minor-party or "other."

<H2> Comparison with Australia </H2>

<p>
The USA uses <a href="Plurality.html">plurality voting</a>.
Australia for its House instead has (since 1918) used
the <a hef="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff (IRV)</a>
system.  We claim IRV <i>also</i> leads to 2-party domination.
Let's check the data.  Here is the <a href="AustralianPol.html">Australian</a>
statehouse+federal IRV-seat grand total:
</p>

<table bgcolor="#ffffdd" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>
564 seats, all major party except for 
33(independent) + 1(one nation party).
</td></tr></table>

<p>
To compare the USA versus Australia (the larger USA figures are if the 49 Nebraskans are
counted as third-party or independent; the smaller ones if they are counted
as major-party):
</p>

<table bgcolor="aqua" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Percentage of</th><th>USA</th><th>Australia</th></tr>
</td><td>
<tr><td>
Third-Party 
</td><td bgcolor="#ddffdd">
0.09% or 0.71% 
</td><td align="right">
0.18% 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Independent 
</td><td  bgcolor="#ddffdd">
0.25% or 0.87% 
</td><td align="right">
5.8% 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>  Australia(IRV seats) is <i>slightly</i> better for third parties (and
especially for independents &ndash; most Australian and USA independents are
major-party politicians who split with their parties while in office) than the USA.  
But both are obviously extremely hostile for third-parties.
[And incidentally, the difference may largely be due to Australia's PR senate, which
causes third parties to be strong in Australia despite almost never winning IRV house seats.]
<i>But</i> if Nebraska's 
49-member unicameral house is counted as third-party
(which is somewhat unrealistic, although they all officially claim to be "nonpartisans")
then it is the <i>USA</i> that is more 3rd-party-philic than Australia.
</p>

<H2> Comparison with Fiji </H2>

<p>After Australia,
the country that used IRV the second-most, was
<a href="FijiPol.html">Fiji</a> (just overthrown
by a coup; adopted IRV in 1997-8). Two-party domination then gradually
set in. By the 2006 election the stats were as follows:
</p><blockquote>
Of the 71 seats, 36+31 were won by the top 2 parties, and
<i>two</i> were won by members of a minor party.
Probably if this experiment had been allowed to continue the minors
would soon have been zeroed out. 
</blockquote>
<img src="assets/images/Fiji2006.png">
<p>
In contrast: it took a lot longer
than 9 years for the USA to settle into 2-party domination mode.
</p><p>
In both Fiji and Australia there also are seat-holders who are
not affiliated with any political party.
Most of them (again like in the US: Lieberman and Jeffords) are major
party candidates who split with their parties. 
These constitute 2-6%,
thus outweighing the minor parties by a lot (again as in the US).
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>  
Switching to IRV will still yield massive 2-party domination (perhaps slightly 
less massive, but still enormous)
and may increase the numbers of unaffiliated seat-holders to between 2-6%.
