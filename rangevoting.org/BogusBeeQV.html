<H2> Honeybees do not use "quadratic voting." They use

The following highly misleading and wrong article appeared:
</p><blockquote>
Rory Sutherland &amp; Glen Weyl:
<a href="SuthWeylBees.html">Humans are doing democracy wrong. Bees are doing it right</a>,
<i>The Spectator</i>, 2 May 2015.

</blockquote>
<p>
We will refute it, virtually entirely, from top to bottom.
Their main claim is that "quadratic voting" is the method used by honeybees, which they contend 
is a better voting system.  Here are the key quotes, with
sentences numbered for easy reference, from the Sutherland/Weyl piece.
</p>
<blockquote>
QUOTES:
<b>(1)</b> The renowned biologist Thomas D. Seeley...
was part of a team which discovered that colonies of honey bees look for new pollen sources to harvest by sending out scouts who search for the most attractive places. 
<b>(2)</b> When the scouts return to the hive, they perform complicated dances in front of their comrades.<b>(3)</b> The duration and intensity of these dances vary: bees who have found more attractive sources of pollen dance longer and more excitedly to signal the value of their location. 
<b>(4)</b> The other bees will fly to the locations that are signified as most attractive and then return and do their own dances if they concur. 
<b>(5)</b> Eventually a consensus is reached, and the colony concentrates on the new food source.
<b>(6)</b> Of course, every bee wants credit for their own find. 
<b>(7)</b> So there needs to be a countervailing costly mechanism to prevent bees from simply over-promoting any pollen source they know. 
<b>(8)</b> Bees must spend a lot of energy to bring their fellows around. 
<b>(9)</b> Seeley's research shows that the time they spend on dances grows not linearly but quadratically in proportion to the attractiveness of the site they encountered. 
<b>(10)</b> Twice as good a site leads to four times as much wiggling, three times as good a site leads to nine times as lengthy a dance, and so forth.

OK, let's stop here and go through those crucial
Sutherland/Weyl
quotes pointing out what's wrong.
Of the 10 sentences above, we will show that
1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 &ndash; that's 70% &ndash; were false; the entire main
thrust of the article is false; and their evidence is simply fabricated.
Actually it is even worse than 70% because sentence 10 really contains several lies.
The reader probably would have been better off flipping a coin, since that
tends to yield 50% accuracy.   In my opinion, anybody who publishes anything this false
should not be a professional scientist, and if they want to try, then they must immediately 
publish an enormous retraction.
</p><p>
You can learn plenty about honeybee democracy from our <a href="ApisMellifera.html">web page</a>
on that topic. In fact I was the person who first realized the honeybee's voting system is 
essentially equivalent to
plain <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>,
i.e. each bee rates each candidate hive-location with a numerical score,
and the highest average score wins.  This realization came by seeing that a mathematical model 
involving eigenvalues, published by Mary Myerscough, could be interpreted in a much simpler manner.
</p><p>
However, all that is for the (generally once-yearly) election 
held for the purpose of determining where to locate the new year's beehive.
It does <i>not</i> concern the question Sutherland &amp; Weyl discuss of
describing the location and quality of "pollen sources."   
Sutherland &amp; Weyl are
simply wrong about that. 
As anybody knows who has devoted 
more than slightest degree of effort to actually reading about bees:
There is no "election" about pollen sources at all. 
There is no single "election winner." There is no voting. 
There is no "consensus reached."  
The colony does not "concentrate" on any single food source, 
because that would be stupid, because having a varied diet from <i>many</i> food sources, 
of course is superior.
</p><p>
The truth: "A bee uses dance sign language to tell its sisters about
a food source's direction, distance, and quality."  That's all. It is like you recommending
a restaurant to some of your friends, who then may or may not individually visit it.
This activity is not normally described by anybody as an 
"election" or "voting."
</p><p>
Was all this "discovered" by Thomas Seeley and his "team"? No, it was not. Seeley has indeed 
studied and written extensively about
bees and their communications and democracy systems, including his
book <i>Honeybee Democracy</i> (Princeton Univ. press 2010)...
but the <i>discoveries</i> of those systems were made by
Karl von Frisch (1886-1982) and his student Martin Lindauer  (1918-2008) mostly
before Seeley got out of kindergarten.
</p><p>
Are the <i>quadratic</i> growth claims in sentences 9 and 10 correct? No.
The truth is the dance duration is <i>linear</i> in the food source attractiveness
(quantitatively: caloric content).
See figure 1 in this paper 
</p><blockquote>
Thomas D. Seeley: <i>Honeybee foragers as sensory units of their colonies</i>,
Behavioral Ecology &amp; Sociobiology 34 (1994) 51-62 (<a href="Hforagers.pdf">pdf</a>).
[Incidentally: Seeley gave me that paper and told me
he did not recall ever making any quadratic claim.]
</blockquote><p>
Is it true that bees must 
"spend a lot of energy" on these communication dances?
No.  Food-reporting "waggle dances" take place on the ground 
and last seconds to minutes &ndash;
small energy expenditure compared to the cost
of flying there, gathering food, and hauling it back.
</p><p>
Is it true that "Of course, every bee wants credit for their own find"?
I am not aware of any evidence about what bees "want" of this nature, and especially not 
that there is any "credit"
ever assigned to anybody by anybody else. 
Indeed, bees will happily listen to and respond to even intentionally-wrong food-reporting 
instructions provided by a robotic pseudo-bee, who (if this were true) would never have had
any "credibility."  if bees kept track of their sisters remembering who was who and who had more
credibiity credit, then
they'd probably have good enough recognition that they would not listen to a robot
who was not one of their sisters at all, in fact not even a bee at all.
And most of the bees doing all this dancing are not 
reporting about "their own find" anyhow, so even if they were somehow able to get and want
discovery-credit, that would be irrelevant.
</p><p>
There is no known need for a "countervailing costly mechanism to prevent bees from simply
over-promoting any pollen source they know."
That is because worker bees (who forage, dance, and observe dances)
do not reproduce.  That means their sole Darwinian motivation is to 
make the hive as a whole succeed, which means they are motivated to report honestly.
They are <i>not</i> motivated to "over-promote."  (Perhaps Sutherland, a
professional 
<a href="http://www.creativebrief.com/blog/2012/03/19/market-leader-interview-%E2%80%93-rory-sutherland-executive-creative-director-and-vice-chairman-ogilvyone-london-and-vice-chairman-ogilvy-mather-uk/">advertising man</a>, 
was unable to comprehend this concept.)
<small>
There actually are very rare circumstances where a worker bee does try to lay eggs and reproduce,
although if she is caught doing so, she is killed.  But even a rare reproducing worker
again has no motivation to lie about food sources, because such lying would only hurt,
not help, her offspring.
</small>
</p><p>
Wait &ndash; there is more.  Sutherland and Weyl falsely claim (sentence 10 above)
that "quadratic voting"
involves paying a cost proportional to the square of the candidate-attractiveness
score you provide in your vote.
This is a false description of what "quadratic voting" is, 
perhaps caused by the fact that Weyl in his original
paper was unable to figure out how to do quadratic voting in elections with more than 2 candidates,
and it was I who had to discover that in <a href="MonetizedRV.html">my</a> paper, which
Weyl and Sutherland were allergic to since it was highly critical of Weyl's.
(Note: bees usually have more than 2 food sources, and more than two
candidate hive locations.)
What is the correct description?
Quadratic vote buying <i>really</i> involves paying a cost <i>zero</i> if your score
for some candidate (that you cast as part of your ballot) concerns any candidate 
other than the ultimate election winner (call him W) or second-placer (call him S).
If, however, you are scoring S or W, then that does cost you, and the cost is the 
square of the <i>difference</i> between the scores you provide for S and for W.
</p><p>
The bees, even in their <i>real</i> election about hive-location (and that really <i>is</i>
an "election," involving "voting" and with a "single winner" and in which a "consensus" 
really is reached), do not  do this.
They could not even if they wanted to, because they do not know ahead of time what
either W or S will be. (Which ignorance, of course,
is why they need to <i>have</i> an election!)
I suppose you could try to argue that paying cost V<sup>2</sup> to cast a score V for each 
candidate-hive-location would be the best <i>approximation</i>
 the bees could provide to the correct quadratic-vote-buying cost function 
(given their inability to predict the future)... except that the bees simply do not
pay V<sup>2</sup>, based on actual observed data.
</p><p>
Now here are a few more quotes from the Sutherland/Weyl piece.
</p><blockquote>
QUOTE:
Thus, it is the total passion of the bees, not simply [their] numbers alone,
that ultimately carries the day...
If you want a better system of voting, the bees have it.
</blockquote><p>
The bees use score voting.  They do not use quadratic voting.
I agree score voting is a superior voting system, and it indeed attempts to compute the
"total passion," although that wording is highly misleading when applied to the bee voting system
because although it is true the bee system is score voting, the algorithm they use ultimately 
<i>converts</i> "highest average score" into "highest number of bees" causing the two 
concepts to lose their separate identities.
I have been saying score voting (without any payment required to cast your vote &ndash;
voting is free)
is better for about 15 years now, and I had the advantage over 
Sutherland and Weyl that I actually knew about what the bees were doing, correctly, not
wrongly, and in fact was the
<i>discoverer</i> of its correct mathematical interpretation of what they were doing, 
well before either Sutherland or Weyl even knew that quadratic voting even existed.
</p><blockquote>
QUOTE:
In fact, Glen Weyl's statistician co-author Steven P. Lalley has shown mathematically that 
QV is the only pricing rule that gives individuals an incentive truthfully to report 
their preferences.
</blockquote><p>
Sorry, that statement is false.  See <a href="MonetizedRV.html">
my 2-year-old report on monetized score voting systems</a> (which Weyl was fully aware of)
for counterexamples.
</p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
Of course, unethical and/or foolish people like Sutherland and Dr.Weyl are motivated 
to over-promote
their own so-called discoveries while showing zero regard for the truth nor performing
any kind of fact checking.
There needs to be a countervailing
costly mechanism to prevent that.
Perhaps this web page will be able to draw attention to their behavior and thus 
serve as that corrective mechanism. Let us hope so.  
The bees do indeed have useful lessons to provide, but only if one actually pays
attention to facts, rather than merely one's personal self-promotion agenda.
