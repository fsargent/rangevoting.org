<p>
A large number of hurricane and earthquake home-destructions can be traced back to failure
of the nails due to pull-through, pull-out, or sheared-through nails.
Bostitch engineer Ed Sutt came up with the obvious answer &ndash; a better nail.
The hurriquake&reg; nail has been designed (through extensive testing of simulated "houses"
in simulated "disasters") to have the right combination of barbs on the end, larger
head, stronger kind of steel, maximum-thickness (for strength) smooth shank part,
and spiral near-head anti-wobble part to make houses stronger.
The tests indicate that if you build your house with hurriquake nails instead of
regular nails, your house will be twice as strong &ndash; at a total cost
of $15 extra per house.
