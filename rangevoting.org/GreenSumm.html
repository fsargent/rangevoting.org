<H2> Why Greens need range voting (Executive summary)</H2>

<ul>
<li>
Range Voting would have gotten Green 2004 Presidential
candidate David Cobb 50 times more votes than he got under plurality
and 2.5 times as many as he would have gotten under Approval Voting.
</li>
<li>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
would be a huge mistake for Greens since it just 
<a href="TarrIrv.html">leads</a> to 2-party
domination just like the plurality system.
</li>
<li>
Without a change in the voting system to get rid of Duverger's law
of 2-party domination, Greens and all third-party candidates will
forever have no chance.  There is not a single third-party
member of the House, Senate, or high Executive branch  (zero out of
about 600 people).
</li>
<li>
So it is a matter of survival: you must push range voting.
</li>
</ul>
