Columbus Dispatch poll - am going by a report in the Free Press (you might want
to make it a hyperlink),<br/>
I did not see original Dispatch article, and I used standard error not 95%
confidence window.&nbsp;<br/>
I worry that the Free Press report on this seemed deceptive because<br/>
there were many other polls, I think all predicting 52-62% for Strickland, and
it did not mention them. See<br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_gubernatorial_election,_2006 for polls in
Oct+Nov predicting<br/>
55+-5, 59+-2, 59, 62+-4, 59, 53, 52+-4, 60+-4, and 52 which actually would mean
Strickland did <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">better</span> than expected.<br/>
<br/>
Checks on the <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Dispatch</span>'s math:<br/>
If N <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">independent</span> people are found in a
poll to cast pN votes for Strickland,<br/>
then the standard error (std. deviation) is sqrt(Np(1-p)) which<br/>
expressed as a fraction of the total number N of votes, is&nbsp; sqrt(p(1-p)/N).<br/>
Here, N=1541 and p=0.67 yielding&nbsp; sqrt(.67*.33/1541) = 1.198% as the std
error;<br/>
the 95% confidence interval is then 1.96*stdDev = 2.35.<br/>
Sp it should have said&nbsp; (67 +- 2.35)%&nbsp; as the 95% confidence interval,
not 67 +- 2.2.<br/>
A slight error.<br/>
The idealization of independent people is definitely false for exit polls (and
you need to multiply<br/>
the standard error by a fudge factor), but for random telephone polls of people<br/>
who say they are "likely voters," it should be accurate (albeit then you are
sampling<br/>
from the wrong distribution).<br/>
The discrepancy between 67 and 60.5 is 6.5, which is 6.5/1.198 = 5.43 standard
errors.<br/>
The <a href="NormTble.html" title="chance">chance</a> of
a deviation this large or larger is about 20 billionths.&nbsp; If by 67 they
really meant 67.5<br/>
then it's 5.84 standard errors and the chance is about 2 billionths; if by 67
they really meant 66.5<br/>
then it's 5.00 standard errors and the chance is 287 billionths.<br/>
