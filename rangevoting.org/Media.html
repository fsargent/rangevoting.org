<H2> How the role of the media would improve under range voting </H2>

<p>
In our current plurality system the media plays a somewhat obnoxious and trivial role. 
They pinpoint the two "front runners."
This informs voters which two candidates are "viable" and therefore worthy
of a vote, and informs them that the remaining candidates are not worth
wasting a vote on, since they have no chance.  
The media accomplishes this by polling, or 
by mindlessly selecting the two candidates with the most money,
and essentially refusing to provide any coverage whatever to third-party candidates, no matter
how interesting their views.
<small>
(That was not just us ranting. We can <a href="MediaHorse.html">back it up with facts</a>.)
</small>
</p>

<p>
The two frontrunners then get to be
the "two evils" in the subsequent plurality-election's
selection of the "lesser of two evils."
</p>

<p>
Of course this role engenders a lot of hatred towards the media. 
Perhaps this hatred is unwarranted since the media plays this
role only because the plurality voting system demands it of them.
</P>

<p>
Under range voting the media would play a more interesting and socially useful role
of identifying which candidates are the best and finding out just what their 
views &amp; qualifications are.
</p>

<p>
The media would not be as obliged to act as a screener for selecting front runners. 
It would no longer serve a useful purpose for the media to deny
coverage to third-party candidates.  All candidates could now play
a useful and non-negligible  role in the war of ideas.
Indeed the media would be <i>obliged</i> to provide more information on
<i>all</i> candidates since every voter gets to award a vote-rating-score to every candidate.
</p>

<p>
If you are a member of the media, don't you think you'd prefer this new state of affairs?

<H3> One reason we know the media blackout of
third-party candidates hurts the USA tremendously </H3>

<p>
Consider the Minnesota gubernatorial election
of 1998.
For some reason the usual policy &ndash; of the media almost completely 
ignoring all third-party candidates,
and the debates (<a href="http://www.opendebates.org/">organized</a> by
the top two parties with the 
implicit cooperation of the media) refusing to
permit any third-party candidate to participate &ndash; didn't happen.
(Probably that was only because both major party candidates 
H.H.Humphrey III and Norm Coleman
thought allowing Ventura to debate would hurt the other.)
</p>
<p>
Result: After the public got to <i>hear</i> Jesse Ventura (Reform Party)
in the debates, he shot from single digits in the polls
up to winning the election with running mate Mae Schunk, despite the fact 
V&amp;S's campaign funding
was far smaller than either of his opponents.
Voter <a href="NonVoters.html">turnout</a>
in Minnesota also increased remarkably, to 63%, apparently 
because of this inclusion.
<small>
(Minnesota campaign finance spending limits and subsidy laws also leveled the
playing field somewhat,
giving Ventura more of a chance against his heavily funded opponents.)

</p>
<p>
If we had range voting, third party candidates getting media attention would become the norm
rather than the exception.

Here's a quote from James M. Perry of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
[quoted in
Steven J. Rosenstone, Roy L. Behr, Edward H. Lazarus:
Third Parties in America:
Citizen Response to Major Party Failure (2nd edition) Princeton Univ. Press 1984, 1996]
explaining why they currently
do not cover third-party candidates:
</p>
<blockquote>
We base [our decision] on the simple proposition that readers don't want to waste their time on 
someone who won't have a role in the campaign. We're not going to run a page-one spread on a 
fringe candidate. We don't have a multiparty system. Until we do, nobody's going to cover these 
candidates.
</blockquote>
