<H1> Improved voting systems in France 2000-</H1>

<p>
France's Presidential elections occur  in April &amp; May of years ending in
2 and 7, and are done with 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting
with separate top-2 runoff (if nobody got over 50% 
in the first round).  
We call that the T2R (<i>t</i>op-<i>2</i>-<i>r</i>unoff)
system for short. 
But there have also been many studies of other
possible voting systems, conducted by academics, 
with government funding and cooperation, as pseudo-election exit polls.
As of the year 2018 these studies provide us with perhaps the best available
simulation/understanding of what would have happened
with those alternative voting systems.  In the table below, the
percentages shown in the "official winner" and "second placer" columns
are for the valid 2nd round votes,
and for approval voting are approval percentages.
Do not confuse Marine Le Pen (daughter) with her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.

(enjoying 76% approval 2.5 years after leaving office) and regards Le Pen's second place
finish as a mistake which far overstated his true popularity.

<br>
<b>Approval</b> &amp; <b>Score</b>: 
All score and approval systems
seem to agree that the top two were {Melenchon, Macron} in some order, with B.Hamon
in third place.  The question of who wins, Melenchon or Macron,
is unclear and seems to depend on the precise details of the system.
But Macron would, at least in April, have won a M-versus-M runoff.
<br>
<b>In hindsight</b>: Macron's approval fell swiftly during the first few months of 
his term (e.g. reaching 40% in both late August 2017 and late March 2018),
and Melenchon's also fell to about 30%.
Nevertheless even at that reduced level Macron still seems to have
more approval than his election rivals, suggesting that, at least up to April 2018,
France still considers him to have been the best choice.
In any case it is clear that M.Le Pen's second place finish far overstated her
true popularity and was an artifact of "vote splitting" among her rivals.

"Methodology: The survey was conducted among a sample of 1005 people, 
representative of the French population aged 18 and over. The representativeness of the 
sample was ensured by the quota method (sex, age, occupation of head of household, 
level of education) after stratification by region and category of agglomeration. 
The interviews were conducted by telephone 7-8 April 2017."

Some people have attempted to criticize approval voting by claiming
(with little or no evidence) that approval voters would simply vote
in "plurality style" i.e. approving exactly one candidate.  (If so,
approval voting would effectively be plurality voting.)  At least in
these French elections, that criticism is incorrect:

<p>
Slightly more than 50% of the voters adopted the strategy of approving 3 (or more) candidates,
while only 19% adopted the "approve exactly one" strategy.
</p><p>
A different strategy is to approve the top fraction-F
of the candidates.  The "%approving>31%" column of the table shows that that strategy was adopted
for F&gt;31%, by slightly over 18% of the voters. I.e. this strategy was almost
as popular as the "approve one" strategy. (With F=31%, this strategy coincides
with plurality when the number C of candidates obeys C&le;3, but differs when C&ge;4.)
</p><p>
Indeed, the closely related strategy of (in a C-candidate election, C&ge;2)
approving the top <nobr>max(1,&lfloor;C/2-(C/2)<sup>1/2</sup>&rfloor;)</nobr>
of the candidates (or more) was adopted by 44% of the voters,
making that strategy over <i>twice</i> as popular 
as plurality-style voting.  Call that the "reduced top half" (RTH) strategy.
(The RTH and plurality strategies happen to be identical if C&le;7 but if C&ge;8 then RTH
voters always approve at least 2, if C&ge;11 at least 3, and if C&ge;14 at least 4,
candidates.)
</p><p>
(The reason the "mean #approved" column contains entries such as "2.23 or 2.33" is
that one figure pertains to the raw data set and the other to an extrapolation 
to all of France.)
</p>
<!--
According to my old computer experiments in 
  /RVstrat3.html
the RTH strategy was actually the best strategy tried
in 4-voter, C-candidate elections for each C=2,3,5,9.

But if the number of voters exceeds 4, this can fail
to be true. And in the limit of a large number of voters
it seems best in the silly zero-info model
to approve all candidates above mean --
which basically would be the "unreduced top half" strategy.

Probably substantially redcuing your #approvals below C/2
makes sense only if V=O(polylog(C)).
