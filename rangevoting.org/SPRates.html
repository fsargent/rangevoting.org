<H2> Spoilage and Error Rates with Range Voting versus other Voting Systems </H2>

<p>(<a href="SPRatesSumm.html">Executive Summary</a>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
(<a href="#conclusions">skip to conclusions</a>)
</p>

<H3> Theoretical expectations </H3>

<p>
With plurality voting, your ballot can be invalidated by voting for two candidates
(overvoting).
</p>

<p>
With instant runoff voting, there are more ways to go wrong.  E.g. you can co-rank two candidates
at any level of the ranking, skip a ranking-level, etc.  
So it seems "obvious" there are going to be <i>higher</i> ballot
spoilage rates with IRV than with plurality.
</p>

<p>
With range and approval voting, there are fewer ways, 
in fact many would say <i>no</i> ways, to go wrong,
because <i>every</i> way to vote or to fill out numbers within the permitted range,
is a valid vote.  So you similarly might expect range and approval voting to have <i>lower</i>
spoilage rates than plurality.
</p>

<p>
All that, however, is just a theory.  The real proof of the pudding is the 
experiment.  As PhD advisors are fond of saying to their poor graduate students,
"Show me the data!".
</p>


<H3> Plurality (real data) </H3>

<p>
According to official plurality-vote totals:
Florida's ballot spoilage rate in 2000 was <b>3%</b>, and
for the US nationwide 2000 presidential election, 
1.9 million ballots were spoiled and hence uncounted
versus 105 million that were counted, for a spoilage rate of <b>1.8%</b>.
</p>

<p>
However, the distribution of invalid ballots in the USA is <i>uneven</i>:
<i>USA Today</i> reported that voters in Florida's majority-black precincts
were four times
as likely to have their 2000 ballots invalidated than white precincts:
8.9% versus 2.4%. 
Among the 100 precincts with the highest numbers of
disqualified ballots, 83 were majority-black.
Allan Lichtman (history professor at American University)
conducted a study of ballot rejection
rates in Florida for the US Commission on Civil Rights.
He found that overall, there was
enormous difference in the rate of white votes and African-American votes
counted in Florida.
When one looks at the variation in the ballot spoilage rates for each
Florida county,
about one-fourth of the variation can be explained solely by knowing how many
African American voters were registered there. 
Controlling for the
number of high
school graduates and literacy failed to diminish this relationship.
For the entire
state, the rate of spoiled ballots for African Americans was 14.4%
while it was 1.6% for non-African Americans.
The US Commission on Civil Rights subsequently claimed that, in 2000 Florida,  
54% of the ballots discarded as "spoiled" were cast by
African Americans, who were only 11% of the voters.

<p>
In <b>California</b>,
1.59% of ballots for governor went uncounted in 1997,
and 1.8% of presidential ballots went uncounted in 2000, but only
0.97% of ballots for governor went uncounted in 2001.   The
2001 decrease was attributed to new voting machine protocols which
immediately
<i>reported</i> invalid ballots to voters to give them 
the option of correcting them.
</p>


<H3> Range, aka Score, Voting
(data from 2004 US presidential election "exit poll" study of human voters) </H3>
<p>
Although in our 2004 range voting exit-poll study
(#82 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>)
we did not collect enough
data to get a statistically significant prediction of ballot-spoilage rates,
nevertheless we shall report our data for whatever it is worth.
It <i>is</i> possible to draw <i>some</i> statistically significant conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Out of 54 range vote ballots in which we demanded the voters fill in every score slot
with a numeric score (no Xs &ndash; intentional blanks &ndash; allowed) one score on
one ballot was unclear.  That is a total ballots-with-problems rate of
<b>1.9%</b>.  However, by using all the other 6 scores on that 7-candidate ballot and
regarding the unclear one as an X, our unused-score rate is only <b>0.026%</b>.
</p>
<p>
Out of 68 range vote ballots in which we allowed
blank scores, there were zero errors (but 5 voters refused to fill in their ballots
at all for privacy reasons).
That is a total ballots-with-problems rate of
<b>0%</b>.  (Of course, it makes sense that allowing blanks would reduce the error rate.)
</p>

<p>
<small> Despite the paucity of our data,
it is actually possible to turn the per-entry error figure into a 
<i>statistically significant</i>
weakened conclusion by using Poisson statistics.
The calculations are as follows.  First, our observed per-entry range error rate based
on a single error in 117 ballots each with 7 entries,
was 1/(117&times;7) which is a factor of 14.8 smaller than the US nationwide
1.8% plurality per-race spoilage rate.  Second, if our true error rate were 3
(or fewer) times smaller than the plurality rate, the probability we would have observed
at most one error, would have been at most 5.93e<sup>-4.93</sup>=4.2%.  Third, if
our true error rate were 2
(or fewer) times smaller than the plurality rate, the probability we would have observed
at most one error, would have been at most 8.4e<sup>-7.4</sup>=0.51%.
Therefore, with 96% confidence we can say that the range per-entry error rate
is at least <b>three</b> times smaller than the plurality per-race error rate,
and with 99.5% confidence we can say that the range per-entry error rate
is at least <b>twice</b> as small as the plurality per-race error rate.
</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>Why</i> does range-voting have a much smaller per-entry error rate than plurality's
per-race error rate?  One might conjecture that the very "complexity" of having to fill
in a <i>number</i> for each candidate makes the voter pay more attention; another
conjecture would be that the repetition involved &ndash; you fill in a number next to
<i>every</i> candidate &ndash; makes errors less likely. (In contrast, in many US
punch-card-based plurality elections, the voter has to find  punch-hole 53,  randomly located
somewhere on a card, corresponding to a candidate on a separate ballot where it says:
"punch hole 53."  This is a <i>one-time</i>, error-prone operation.)  Range voting may seem
more "complicated" than plurality at first glance, but what the data is saying is, that
impression is misleading, since the so-called complexity in this case
actually <i>helps</i> voters.

<H3> Range, aka Score, Voting (data from 2007 French presidential election "exit poll" 
<a href="French2007studies.html">study</a> of human voters) </H3>

<P>
Much more range voting data &ndash; 1752 ballots &ndash;
became available thanks to the government-sponsored
<a href="OrsayTable.html">French Range Voting study</a>.  It entirely confirmed
all the conclusions discussed here from our own smaller and less-good study above,
and now is enough data to make all the conclusions statistically significant.
</p><ul>
<li>
With 19 out of 1752 range ballots deemed invalid, the ballot-spoilage rate was
<b>1.1%</b>.
For a simultaneous approval voting study they 
<a href="French2007studies.html">found</a> <b>0.81%</b> spoilage
and in simultaneous rank-order-ballot study they got <b>7.0%</b> spoilage.
</li><li>
Meanwhile 
in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2007">official</a> 
French 2007 
presidential election conducted via <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting at the same time
as this study, the "spoilt and null votes" amounted to <b>1.44%</b>  in round #1
and <b>4.20%</b> in the second and final round (i.e. the runoff between Sarkozy &amp; Royal),
i.e.
<b>2.9%</b> in all.
</li><li>
In the preceding French (2002) 
presidential election conducted via <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, the
spoilage rates were
<b>2.5%</b> of the registered voters
in round #1 and <b>4.5%</b> in the second and final round
 (i.e. the runoff between Chirac &amp; Le Pen), i.e.
<b>3.5%</b> in all.
</li><li>
In that 2002 election an exit-poll study of thousands of voters was done using
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">approval voting</a>.
That study obtained an <b>0.4%</b> spoilage rate.

<b>Later note:</b>
I do not have state-based data for other years, but
it may be that 2004 was an atypically bad year for ballot spoilage in Australia,
since the nationwide average figures for other years were
</P><pre>
  election        invalid-ballot rate
=============     ===================
24 Nov. 2007      3.95% national invalid rate,
10 Nov. 2001      4.82%
 3 Oct. 1998      3.78%
 2 March 1996     3.2%   (turnout 95.77%)
13 March 1993     2.97%  (turnout 95.75%)
<b>Time-avg (93-07)  3.98%</b>
</pre>
<p>
But it seems even a good year for Australia has comparable ballot spoilage to a pretty bad
year for a plurality-voting country.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ireland</b> holds its presidential elections using the IRV system, an event of
low interest because the position is largely powerless and ceremonial in nature, and
often only one candidate runs unopposed.  (7 year terms.)
In the 1997 election, which was the last contested one
(according to <a href="http://www.electionsireland.org">http://www.electionsireland.org</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.binghamton.edu/cdp/era/index.html">Binghampton elections archive</a>),
Mary McAleese won in a 5-candidate race.
(In the first rounds 3 candidates were eliminated and then McAleese beat
Banotti in the final round by 706259 to 497516.)
The total number of votes which <i>failed</i> to transfer to
these two final candidates, i.e. which were not counted in the final round,
was 66061 out of 1269836 cast, i.e. 5.2% invalid.  Also, there were 0.80% "spoilt" ballots
(which could not even be used in the first round)
for a total of 6.0% ballots unuseable at some stage of the election process.
However, this 6.0% figure
is not really a true measure of the rate of invalid ballots because 
some of those 5.2% perhaps <i>intentionally</i> did not wish to
specify a preference between McAleese and Banotti, as opposed to having it discarded due
to an <i>error</i>.  
In <a href="Ireland1990.html">1990</a> the same websites report Mary Robinson won
in a 3-candidate election with 1574651 "valid" and 9444 "spoilt" votes, which
is a tiny 0.60% spoilage rate.  But in addition to these "spoilt" votes there were 25548 votes
which failed to transfer, i.e. failed to specify a preference between the final
contenders 
Robinson and Lenihan, which is 1.62% and makes 2.22% when both kinds of spoilage are
summed.
All of these 1990 and 1997 numbers were larger than the exceedingly tiny
spoilage rate (0.56%) in the 1973  election, which effectively
was a plurality election since there
were only 2 candidates.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion:  Australia IRV ballots have 
<i>far</i> higher invalidity rates
than
the USA's and other countries' rates for plurality ballots above &ndash;
every Australia area listed here did worse than every plurality country
listed there.  Also, although our Irish data may not be what you really want,
as far as it goes it also indicates larger invalid-ballot rates 
in IRV than plurality contests <i>within</i> Ireland.

<i>Overvote means a voter selected two or more candidates for the same office.
Undervote/drop-off means voter selected no candidate for that race.  In either
IRV or plurality voting,
undervoting has the same effect as not voting at all in that race.  
<!-- Overvoting spoiled both
plurality and IRV (if top) ballots in San Francisco and such ballots were not counted at all in
that race.   Undervoting/drop-off could only partially spoil an IRV ballot.
-->
</i></p>

<p>
So from this we see that the <b>overvote error rates</b>
in San Francisco &ndash; same place, same time, same voters,
just IRV versus plurality races &ndash;
ranged from 3 to 11 
times higher
with IRV than with plurality voting, <b>typically 7 times higher.</b>
<small>
(If double-ranking a <i>non</i>-top candidate 
in IRV were also considered &ndash; we haven't &ndash;
then IRV overvote error rates would have been even higher.)</small>
And this conclusion is fully statistically significant.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the undervotes and dropoffs probably mostly were "intentional" rather than "errors,"
but anyhow were comparable for both Plurality and IRV.

<a href="MinnepolisRCVreptJune2010.pdf">report</a>
Minneapolis commissioned to assess the results:
</p><blockquote>
Of the 45,968 total ballots
cast, there were 1,888 spoiled ballots and 2,958 voter error ballots,
which indicates ballots with voter
errors specific to Ranked Choice Voting, including overvote, repeat
candidate, skipped ranking and undervote.
Comparatively, during
the general municipal election in 2005 [plurality voting], there were 755 spoiled ballots
of the total 70,987 absentee and in-person voters...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The above numbers mean that in 2005 1.06% of all ballots cast were
spoiled, as opposed to 4.1% in 2009.
<i>Additionally</i>, 6.43% (2,958) of the ballots cast had errors specific to
RCV. These ballots were ultimately counted [at least in the first IRV "round"]
because voter intent could be
ascertained. <!--However, there [remains] concern [because of these] nearly 6.5% of the voters
[who] appeared not to cast a vote properly using RCV.-->
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...combined the two accounted for 7.49% of all the ballots cast...
errors on nearly 7.5% of all the ballots cast are potentially troubling. 
Such a high error rate is significant enough that should it 
persist it could affect the outcome of elections in the future.

Here's some of the report's spoilage rate data split up by ward-by-ward 
comparing the spoilage rate before (2005) and after (2009) ranked-choice voting was enacted,
in graphical form:

We thank Joyce McCloy for giving us this report, "SJVoter" for the ward-by-ward part
of the graphic (from Minneapolis election dept data),
and here's blogger <a href="RedCrayon.html">Dale Sheldon-Hess</a> ranting 
about continued mis-representation
of this truth about Minneapolis by ranked-choice-voting propagandists.

Prof. Alan Sherman conducted an 'election' in a 
<a href="ShermanPetElection.pdf">kindergarten</a> 
using three different voting methods.  41 children voted in each.
With plurality voting, there were 6 invalid ballots, i.e. 15%, or
with a 1&sigma; error bar (16&plusmn;7)%.
But both approval and range voting yielded no errors, i.e. (2&plusmn;2)% each.
("Dog" won with all three voting methods.)

<H3> German approval voting study </H3>

<p>
This exit-poll 
<a href="GermanApprovalStudies.html">study</a>
of a few thousand real voters in two towns in several German elections 
in January 2008 and September 2009
found ballot spoilage rates of 0.07%, 0.14%, and 0.62%.
</p><p>
These compare favorably with the official nationwide spoilage rates
of 1.7% in Sept. 2009 and 1.4% in 2005.

<a name="conclusions"></a>
<H3> Conclusions </H3>

<p>
Based on our data,
the ballot spoilage rate with
range voting would be about <i>one third</i> of what it now is with plurality, 
in terms of the count
of ballots-with-problems, and below <i>10%</i> of what it now is,
in terms of the entries-affected rate. 
These are fully
statistically significant conclusions.
And keep in mind that our voters had never
range-voted before in their lives and did not have the benefit of voting machines
&ndash; with experience and machines, range error rates 
presumably would improve even further.  
</p>
<p>
With IRV in San Francisco 2004, 
the ballot spoilage rates were 7 times larger
than under plurality voting, while in Minneapolis 2009 it got multiplied by a factor of 
4 (and the rate of <i>errors</i>, i.e. including <i>both</i> spoiled and not-fully-spoiled ballots,
got multiplied by a factor of over 10)
&ndash; and these too are fully statistically significant.
Australia in IRV races reports higher spoilage rates everywhere, than every entry in our
collection of plurality countries' spoilage rates, but the increase is
not a factor of 7, it is more like a factor of 2-to-6.   One might conjecture this
improvement versus San Francisco is due to the greater level of IRV experience
the Australians possess.
</p><p>
One would expect <a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval Voting</a>
also to be better than plurality since
"overvoting" is a form of ballot spoilage that is no longer possible.  
And indeed due to its greater simplicity one might further expect (although one should beware of 
theoretical expectations) approval's error rates
would also be below those for range voting.
The only
approval-voting spoilage-rate data I have &ndash; 
the <a href="FrenchStudy.html">French study</a>
and 
<a href="GermanApprovalStudies.html">German study</a>
&ndash; had in the French case 10 spoiled ballots out of 2597 for an extremely low 
(0.385 &plusmn 0.122)% spoilage rate.
The German rates ranged from 0.07% to 0.62%.
Those rates are an order of magnitude smaller than the 
spoilage rate in the official French 2002 plurality+top-2-runoff election happening simultaneously
with the French exit-poll study (and also are 2 to 23 times better than the official
German spoilage rates) and they are lowest spoilage rates
ever observed among all the elections 
and studies recounted on this page.
So these results certainly are consistent with our optimistic expectations.
</p>
<h3> Bottom Line </h3>
<p>
In short: 
<i><a href="Approval.html">Approval Voting</a> is better than 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> is better than 
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> is better than 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a></i>
with respect to ballot spoilage rates.
</p><p>
Each "better" here appears to represent a multiplicative factor between about 2 and 10 under
otherwise-similar conditions.
