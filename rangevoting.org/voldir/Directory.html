<p><b>33: bernard b carman, <a href="https://rangevoting.org/voldir/www.ReformTheLP.org  &  www.SeedsOfTruth.org">bernard b carman</a></b>  bbc /at) infinitygames (., com;asheville, nc, USA 28801; i'm an audio engineer, as well as a Macintosh consultant.  i'm also a co-founder of the Libertarian Reform Caucus (LRC).  over the past year or so, i've become more interested in learning about the strengths and weaknesses of various voting systems.  as far as i can tell it seems RV is the way to go, unless there is no computer being used and only a simple voting round is warranted, in such case, Approval Voting would suffice.    i am interested in the possibilities of advocating a test county in NC for RV.  thus far, there is apparently an allowance for there to be a test of IRV in certain counties for certain races, and i'm looking into this.  i hope to somehow encourage RV to also be considered.    on this Range Voting site, i would like to see another example on the fron page like the one we have adopted on our LRC site.  it uses the -5 to +5 scale, having 0 be neutral.  while i understand the upshot is identical, i feel that using negative & positive numbers, the voter can more clearly understand how his vote affects the outcome.  otherwise, using all positive numbers might give the impression that the voter is "giving" points to a candidate, unless they choose zero (0).  also, it's nice to use an odd number of points on the scale, in order to create a perfect "neutral".    also, i believe the simpler examples should be first.  the 0-99 range is extremely excessive using such a fine degree of scale, and might serve to run off newcomers to the simplicity of RV.  it seems RV would be a much easier sell to Americans across the board if the organization focused on keeping it as simple as possible.  details regarding other versions of RV can be left to those who wish to "dig deeper".    if RV was ever really implemented in political elections, it also seems that people would prefer a smaller scale - like a 5 or 7 point scale.  most people cannot very accurately decide the difference between a +2 or +3 on the 11 point scale we've adopted in the LRC.  if even a 7 point scale was adopted, it's so much easier to determine the range of approval/disapproval when there are only 3 points above and below the neutral (0).    among polling several LRC members, the 5 point scale was preferred for simplicity, while i was pushing for a 7 point scale for a compromise.  apparently, our webmaster was persuaded by some RV "gurus" to adopt the 10 point (or actually, 11 point) scale ó i presume for consistancy with this website.    regardless, i'm quite happy that there is a group of people advocating RV.  i wish there was an easy way to convince the IRV advocates, which seem to have more momentum thus far.  it seems relatively easy to convince most folks in general when they understand that they already know about RV from the Olympics, entertainment, the school grading system, movie rating, and rating the opposite sex!  8-)</p>

<p><b>37: Paul Gordon, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/184/248">Paul Gordon</a></b> I've never been political and largely ignored politics for most of my life. We're raised from birth to laud America as this special, wonderful place where morality and benevolence and democracy rules; last summer I was in for a shock when I finally started becoming interested in history and current events and realized how different this nation is from how we are encouraged to think of it. Even before Iraq, the US has engaged in the most frivolous, inexcusable, unconscionable massacres. The disconnect from what people think their government stands for, and the long-standing reality of our foreign policy appears to be a striking and massive failure of democracy. I became to care deeply about politics and asked why this could be. After a few months of research it seemed to me that the US is suffering from three major problems, the first of which may not be obvious but I would argue is the largest and greatest threat - monetary policy, a deeply compromised mass media, and a mostly broken democratic system. Range voting seeks to directly address one of these problems, and could possibly go a long way to solving the other two. I've reached the point in my life where it isn't enough just to work, I want what I do to mean something.    I am rather experienced in software architecture (see my LinkedIn profile). I donít know if there is a need for that in the CRV movement, but as Iím currently on sabbatical Iím free to do as I wish. I wouldnít mind at all taking my life in a new direction that has nothing to do with computers. Do you need another volunteer?</p>

<p><b>44: Lawrence, <a href="http://www.socialchoiceandbeyond.com"> John C</a></b>  j.c.lawrence [in] cox ,dot, net;Your website was brought to my attention by someone who was perusing my website - http://www.socialchoiceandbeyond.com -  and noticed that I had come up with a similar method of voting to RV. I've since put in a link to RV. My background in common with many of your members is also in computer science. My primary interest is in proving that social choice (contrary to the work of Kenneth Arrow and almost 60 years of literature)is not impossible. This would then open the door, theoretically, to an acceptance of new voting methods and economic models. The current acceptance of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem leads to an acceptance of the status quo and a defeatist attitude toward changing current political and/or economic models. I think that extended choices, both politically and economically, will result in greater freedom and democracy. The computer has a definite role in amalgamating and processing the concomitant increased volume of data. I am conceptually developing a political/economic system I call preferensism based on expressing individual preferences over a range of options which is similar to range voting. I also have a blog - http://willblogforfood.typepad.com - which deals, partiall, with some of these same issues and ideas. I look forward to participating with you to carry these ideas forward!</p>
<p><b>45: Bramscher, Paul</b> I've got a B.S. in Computer Science, and work as a programmer at the Digital Library Development Lab, in the Science & Engineering Library at the University of Minnesota.  In addition to about 10 years in IT and a strong algorithmic background, I've got a B.A. in Anthropology & History with some graduate work.  I've got a strong interest in current events, political philosophy, nature writing, and camping/roadtripping.    My political inclinations have evolved from the Democratic Party, an interest in Marxism while attending college, then the Green Party.  I've now begun to disengage from them and, in fact, wish that we had no such thing as partisanship at all.  Just open debate between the merits multiple good policy alternatives -- not manufactured personalities, umbrellas, power cartels, etc. which partisanship seems to entail, curb, scope, etc.    One of my chief concerns with the Green Party here in Minnesota is that they've not even really debated the merits of alternatives to the current voting system.  IRV just seems to have popped out of nowhere, with no debate possible.  They are gaining some momentum here (http://www.betterballotcampaign.org/node/254), but when I emailed a polite inquiry to one of the Green Party activists involved on it (Darrell Gerber), who I've met in-person before, I got no response whatsoever.  It's rather odd -- we all agree that the current system is broken, but shouldn't we at least open an honest debate on something new?    I tend to see the purpose of voting as a political sampling mechanism (ideally comprehensive/complete).  Range is clearly superior mathematically for reasons spelled out well by others.  It mainly boils down to the capability of capturing the distance between preferences, rather than collapsing them all into equal weight (IRV's artifice -- an unsound handicap).  Under IRV, some distances are magnified, whereas others are minimized (blindly, by the system).    I may be more of a math nerd than most people, but I can't see how IRV has eclipsed the (superior) Range Vote in light of these significant problems.</p>
<p><b>46: Welland Matthew</b> I believe that there are three fundamental requirements for the United States to NOT degenerate into some form of fascism or religious or military state:    1. A strategy resistant voting methodology (of which I believe Range Voting is the most promising).  2. A taxation system that is just and fosters economic development, the only system that meets that criterion to the best of my knowledge is the Henry George single tax (www.henry-george.org).  3. An education system that teaches a wide range of ideas and viewpoints while not necessarily expecting or requiring students to agree.    I am building a web site which will (hopefully) illustrate the best known ways to meet those criteria by embodying them in the fabric of the site itself. The ultimate goal is that the site achieves stable self governingship and I can safely release it from my control without it degenerating into a flame-infested mess. The current (broken) incarnation is at www.kiatoa.com but a new version is under development.    I will be building range voting into the new site and will point back to rangevoting.org for reference.</p>

CRV seems to offer a realistic way to quickly and measurably improve the voting system and re-engage Americans.  If range voting were ever to be adopted I think millions more Americans would go to the polls and our process would be more responsive to the people as opposed as to corporations and special interests.

After IRV, hoever, I switched to Condorcet and then Borda.  Still think that Borda is the best preference-ballot system as long as "indifferent" preferences are allowed.  I've noticed that most  descriptions of Borda don't allow this.  I have developed a system I call the "Bell-ballot" system  that extends preference voting and uses a Borda-like method for finding the "best"  aggregate preference(which can be "partial").

But I have thought about this a lot, and I have a counting system for approval with multiple candidates that I think would work. (Would let us fix gerrymandering at the same time)    And I'd love to figure out a way to make progress getting range or approval adopted. </p>

<p><b>130: Chrisco Craig Lee</b>  I am sorry, but I have no special skills for you. I am just a guy who started to attend University after High School, but ran out of money and had to take a job in a restaurant. Here is a little about myself:     I am an independent sick of having to choose the lesser of 2 evils. Understandably, that is not that much of a problem any more:     With the unholy alliance between the theocrats, election-companies, defense-contractors, and neocons, I just vote Democratic because the Democrats just take brides and steal public money. It is so convenient to just know which party is the lesser of the evils. ¬°Thanks Republicans for making my job as a voter so easy!     I finished most of my foundational coursework and requirements before I ran out of money and left University. In the restaurant, I worked every position. I current mostly cashier.     I live in Petaluma, California. I am a native English-speaker. I taught myself Esperanto:     ¬øƒàu vi scipovas paroli la lingvon internacian Esperanto?     I speak some Spanish. I believe that the inverted punctuation the Spaniards invented is a great innovation. I use inverted punctuation. I use inverted punctuation in English and Esperantic texts which annoys everyone else. ¬øWhat is your opinion about inverted punctuation? ;-)     I join because I want to reform the system. I focused mainly on voter-verifiable papertails before because that is what kept the Republicans in power in the early and mid-2000s.  Now that this battle is mostly won, it is time to improve the system in other ways, although it would be nice for a Federal mandate requiring voterverifiable papertrail because many redstaters are still screwed, and is part of why those states are still red.     I thought about what could be changed and what cannot.  Among things we cannot change, I would like to improve would be:     * - Directly elect the President     * - Eliminate termlimits but make all terms nonsequential.     * - Eliminate age restrictions for offices.     * - Elected Senators ever 2 years so that we have 150 Senators with 1 election for 6-year term happening ever 2 years so that each state will have 3 Senators.     * - Set cloture in the Senate to 80 Senators.     * - Add an House of Proportional Representation of Parties for parties with 1 hundred members.     * - Add an House of Proportional Representation for Independents.     * - Have elections to the Houses of Proportional Representation of Parties occur annually.     * -  Increase the size of the Supreme Court to 50 with 1 judge from each state.     * - Require that judges for the Supreme Court to receive > 2/3rds of members of each house and of the states too (only the best of the best should be on the Supreme Court).     These are all great ideas, but they require changes to the US-Constitution, so we have no hope of changing these.  What can we hope to change:     * - The voting system using local initiatives (politicians will never change the system which elected them).     * - Redisticting.     * - Church/State-Separation (If an American wants to live in a theocracy, that american should move to Saudi Arabia, where that former American can stone to death raped women for adultery ‚Äî rape is sex outside of marriage which according to the Koran is adultery which according to the Koran is a stonable offense, so therefore, according to the Koran, the community should stone her to death.  Religion and government do not mix.).     * - Campaign-Finance:     - Only registered voters ‚Äî not corporations ‚Äî can donate money.     - Allowable annual contributions to 1kU$D annually per registered voter ‚Äî no more millionaires buying politicians.    Ballotaccesss    primaries    equal airtime     * - Increase the size of the House of Representatives to 1 thousand.     I investigated voting systems.  None of them were any good.  I created my list of requirements:     * - The voting system must allow people to voter against bad choices.     * - One should can cast fractional votes in addition to just negative -1, 0, and positive +1.     Basically, I reinvented range-voting, but with the improvement of negative votes.  Long ago, I learned that when I invent something, usually.  I wonder how many people reinvent range-voting in the movement versus how many people in the movement stumble upon range-voting and decide that it is a good idea. someone already invented it.  After some searching, I discovered range-voting.    By the way, I believe that I understand why voting systems other than plurality generally and range-voting specifically have trouble getting traction:     As Sir Francis Bacon would explain, it is a problem of ‚ÄúIdols of the Marketplace‚Äù.  People take ‚ÄúOne Man, one vote‚Äù too literally.  That is why alternative voting systems face such problems when presented to people fed up with republcats and democans.  Range-voting despite being the best system has more resistance than other voting systems because it allows less than an whole vote.  Many people who understand that range-voting is best resist negative votes for the same reason.     I also have an idea for ending Gerrymandering using computers for drawing the district.  My idea is very different.  It uses genetic algorithms.  I have know idea whether it would work because I never tried it:     0 - Start with a plane slicing through the Earth in such a way as to create the smallest ellipse completely bounding the state.     1 - Choose a random point with the accuracy of arcseconds.     2 - Choose a random point 1 arcminute away from the first point rounded to the nearest arcsecond.     3 - Treat the second point as a vertex of a perfect hexagon with the first point being another vertex.     4 - Completely cover the ellipse with hexagons defined by the first 2 vertices.     5 - Label every vertex.     6 - Create a population based on the just created map with each vertex randomly shifted +/- 1 arcsecond latitude and +/- 1 arcsecond in longitude.     Now we need a fitness metric:     * - Every district over or under the proper number of districts is +1 points.     * - The population of the most populous district divided by the least populous district is converted to points.     * - Any excess in length of the portion of a district in the state over the smallest hexagon encompassing that area is converted to via how many times extra perimeter the hexagon has.     * - Selection favors the lower number of points.     * - All hexagons must be convex.     The algorithm is simple:     0 - Randomly grab 3 individuals from the population.     1 - Determine the number of points each of these has.     2 - Kill the individual with the highest score or if a tie occurs, kill 1 of the individuals with the highest score randomly.     3 - Create 3 new individuals from the 2 parents by randomly swapping like vertices.     4 - Kill the parents.     5 - Have every vertex in the 3 new individuals randomly shift +/- 1 arcsecong in latitude and +/- 1 arcsenond in longitude.     6 - Throw the 3 new individuals back into the population.     7 - Return to step # 0.     Over a few million generations, most vertices and the hexagons they define will drift off of the state; followed by the remaining hexagons changing size, shape, and orientation until they find a local optimum.  The local optimum should be very good.  Unfortunately, I am not sure since I never tried it.  It is just one of my untested ideas.     Skype</p>

I've done preliminary research, and Range Voting looks to be the most promising.  I'm interested in implementing it on a website of my own design, yet to be made - perhaps with some minor changes.  I am curious if it would be possible to consolidate votes of varying ranges (e.g. a vote on the {0,1} range, along with a vote in the {0...9} range), as I'd love to be able to let newcomers to the site use a simple "like/don't like" vote, and allow more experienced judges the option of more intricate votes.  I would probably weigh the experienced judges' votes more as well, but I'd like to be able to separate weight and accuracy.  I'm also interested in leadership elections through content - i.e. content is rated by viewers, creators of that content are rated in-turn by how good their content is and their vote count. Highly-rated users then have higher-rated votes, and the cycle continues.  Those highly rated users then gain certain responsibilities for their community.    That probably has nothing to do with range voting anymore.  Hmmm...    At any rate, I think promoting the adoption of range voting, or any system that optimizes Bayesian Regret or similar metrics, is absolutely crucial for society to function and survive.

It concluded by advocating Range Voting as the optimal voting system, and I agree with this conclusion.  There's a movement for voting reform in the UK right now, but most advocates for it only propose a voting system that's more proportional than Plurality (which isn't hard to find); the most popular candidates include AV and STV.

<p><b>158: Flatow, Daniel</b> I have a master's degree in Mathematics.  Before I had heard about this range voting system, I thought up this range voting system independently, and wanted to share it with the world.  Then I found out that this system had already been thought of, and that it was called range voting, or score voting, and then found this website of others who share this view.  I also have ideas to improve on this system.  One is to eliminate political parties and have all of the candidates for any election face the voters only once, when the voters would employ range voting to select the winner(s).  The other is to balance the score scale between the positive and negative numbers, so that, for example, a candidate could receive a score of anything between -50 and +50 from any one voter, and the default score would be 0, in the middle.  If the scores are then averaged among all voters who vote for any candidate, that would take care of the quorum problem.</p>

I looked into it more, and sure enough, you can satisfy all the "impossible" requirements simply by using range voting. From then on, I've campaigned (in my own small way) to make range voting the only voting system anyone ever uses. For one, I require its use for elections in the chapter of the Secular Student Alliance I founded.    Really, this issue strikes me as one of the most obvious in all of politics. We have a MATHEMATICAL PROOF that our voting system is the best. There. Done. There should be no further debate. It's like arguing over whether 2+2=4 or the sky is blue.</p>

I have a published paper on Statistical Science showing electoral fraud during the 2004 Venezuela recall referendum.    I am registering because I am convinced that even without vote rigging (manual and electronic) and even if gerrymandering is solved, still the electoral system here needs a reform and range voting could be part of the solution. Early in 2012 the opposition made a primary election with 5 candidates: A, B, C, D & E. Almost no one liked E. People where afraid of A and B was winning the polls by a bit over A. As a result, people who really liked C and D ended up voting for B who won by a landslide. I thing the results could have been more fair with range voting.    My skills are: Expert Wolfram Mathematica user and web developer (Ruby on Rails). I my not be able to help much now do to lack of time, but someday, if things finally change for the better down here, then I would have influence to push for range voting.

We want the mock elections to be as authentic, reliable, simple and secure as possible and are totally open to introducing and training our members to a new system that, in time, could replace our current actual voting system in the USA.  For the first time with all of my study of voting systems I have just become familiar with "range" and "approval" voting and I like what I am reading on both subjects as well as the videos which are helpful.  We need a system that can be developed primarily for on-line Internet voting for a large number of elections in various jurisdictions and large numbers of members. I would like to make contact with the appropriate CRV person to move this conversation further. I look forward to hearing from someone regarding this project to determine the potential for moving forward quickly to join your efforts and help, if our help is required, with the development and integration of the software required to implement . My cell number is in the information above. I am available from 6AM to 11PM CST most days..  Following is a quick 60 second description of our plan.    60 second Explanation of MaxForce America   "Let me tell you about MaxForce as briefly as possible: MaxForce is a group of patriots who are gathering momentum from individuals just like you and your network of friends, determined to turn this country around using three creative approaches at once:  (1) War Rooms, (across the country, by voting precinct), where we will plan strategies and tactics, debate issues, and find candidates; (2) the Virtual Constitutional Republic, where we will elect a "shadow government" of watchdog citizens who will either get the attention of incumbents, or work to replace them; and (3) a combined educational and game program called MindQuark where those who study will earn points which will be redeemable for rankings, merchandise, scholarships, and even cash prizes.  If you want to play, America can use some ReFounding Fathers right now, and you and your ten friends can lay the foundations for the future of freedom and liberty."  Thanks for your courtesies,  John</p>

<p><b>233: Goldman, Brian</b> I am a computer science PhD student, and I am very interested in voting methods and their impact on politics.  I believe the best course for improving government is to change how we elect officials, and that involves both the voting system and campaign finance.  I think the most manageable way to effect a change is to convince a state governments to modify how it does districting and to implement better support of third party candidates.    I'm strongly liberal, and I've been angry about politics for a long time.  I am interested in doing more than just being angry.  Unfortunately I have no idea where to start.    My most useful relevant skills are likely programming and public speaking.</p>

<p><b>250: Megan Reif </b> My research seeks to explain variation in election violence, reform, and democratization. my area expertise is broadly comparative, but emphasizes Algeria, Pakistan, the Middle East/North Africa (MENA), and Muslim world more generally. I am a Project Manager for MENA and Election Violence and Fraud with the Varieties of Democracy Project and a Research Fellow with the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg.    Reif worked with the Intl Fdn. for Election Systems, Pakistan's Free & Fair Election Network, the Asia Foundation, and the Carter Center. She taught Middle East and Muslim world politics, democracy, election integrity, survey methods, quantitative analysis, and research design at the University of Colorado Denver (faculty) and/or the University of Michigan (graduate student).    Reif is motivated by a desire to support conditions for internally-driven democratization through (1) analysis and dissemination of qualitative and quantitative data that better enables new democracies to learn from the (messy) political evolution of what are now considered "consolidated" or "advanced" democracies; (2) theoretically-driven findings and insights that are also policy-relevant; (3) collaboration with international and local social scientists and practitioners to leverage combined area and methodological knowledge; (4) capacity-building for research and programming to promote peaceful democratization while diminishing need for foreign or external expertise; (5) development of cross-cultural and international understanding with research that tests assumptions of national or regional exceptionalism with empirical rigor, utilizing mixed methods that include historically-informed event data analysis, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)/mapping, spatial analysis, sequence analysis, survey methods, archival research, text analysis, and other techniques.</p>

<p><b>252: Latimer, Brian</b> I'm a web developer.  I'd like to learn more about voting and to what extent various things about voting can be proven and the math and techniques to make such proofs.  I have been reading your pages for years and based on my current understanding, I'd like to see range voting in place for single seat offices.  I have been wondering about the implications of proxy voting for seats in a body like the legislature and what the best ways to keep such a thing secure might be.  I recently read about court precedent where election laws have been overturned when one voter's vote "weighs" more than another voter's and I'd like to find out if the wording in the court decisions is such that it can be proven that congressional districts serve to disenfranchise voters and that all voters would be better off with proxy voting, range voting, or reweighted range voting.  even 1 vote per person with all candidates for all seats on the same ballot seems like it would have better results, though I haven't done the math.  In any case, if the case law exists that has overturned previous election laws, can that case law, along with appropriate proofs meeting the criteria described in the case law be used to overturn plurality voting and get us using anything else?  I'd like to learn more and bring suit against the government if I, or other plaintiffs, can find the case law and proofs.</p>

<p><b>310: Daniel Riley</b>  djr.danielriley -in; gmail (dot/ com;Cary, IL, USA 60013; I'm a high school student in AP Research. In this brand new AP class, we write one research paper throughout the whole year and submit it for an AP grade. I'm planning on writing my paper about range voting, specifically on if range voting unavoidably introduces a new strategic element: that most people will tend towards the extremes (i.e. 0-1 or 9-10 on a 10-point scale) and not an "ideal" bell curve, but I also may write it about discovering if 100-point scales or even higher scales have votes centralized around the nearest 10 or 25, for example, reducing their purpose.    I am looking for your input on both topics, but most of all, if there is some unknown aspect to range voting that needs research, I'd try to form a research topic on it. I believe that replacing our current system is crucial, and will do what I can to research the benefits and possible drawbacks of any system that could replace it so the campaign to replace plurality voting is as strong as it can be.</p>
<p><b>311: Kearns, Spenser</b> Hello! The whole debate over which voting system would be most optimal for our country intrigues me. After a lot of research, I decided to throw my weight behind Range Voting. I looked at both rangevoting.org and fairvote.org's criticisms of each other's advocated system, and rangevoting.org seemed to do a much better job of arguing their case.     My skills: I'm a teacher. Not as a profession, but as a person. While I don't currently teach, I have taught chess to elementary schoolers, as well as saxophone to high schoolers. I feel as though I could best serve this organization through face to face interaction with local politicians and activists, spreading the word on our beloved system. I have already begun doing this, and every single candidate I've spoken to has admitted they don't really have an opinion and need to do more research. I feel as though this is something people who fall anywhere on the political spectrum can easily get behind with proper education.     I personally got into politics, like most millennials, through Bernie Sanders. I don't like either major party. It is incredibly frustrating to be voting in a system where I am forced to be a fool or a liar. That is why I'm so interested in range voting.     My questions for you: Do you have any pamphlets that I could distribute? How else do you think I could be of use to you? I'd be more than happy to organize events and take the lead in my city's push for Range Voting.     Changes I think you could make:   The website isn't the prettiest I've seen. I get that it this is a math issue and most people that are interested aren't going to care, but I think adding at least a nice logo would help.  It also would have been extremely helpful if you had a page for every state, with an explanation for how people in that specific state can help move things forward.    Thank you all for what you do,  Spenser      </p>

In fact, my first idea is to turn the site into a wiki. It may seem daunting, but I've done it before, and your layout and attitude is perfect for it. You take page edits by email anyway, and almost all of your content is plain text. Furthermore, you have thousands of pages on the domain, you said, but you would never guess it because they're kind of tucked away in various pages. Converting this content to a wiki, running on MediaWiki, would be easy and would solve all that.    Also, I see at (http://rangevoting.org/WaysToHelp.html) that you would like improvements to the donation infrastructure, etcetera.

One of the reasons I really support range voting is exactly because it will open space for a better and more honest representation, which is sorely needed everywhere in the world.    I'm willing to help with what I can. I've been a staunch advocate of range voting for the past few years, but I want to do more (especially given Trump's win and the current political climate in Brazil).    One of the typical (but silly) criticisms I keep hearing is that people seem to resist browsing the current rangevoting.org website due to it's simplistic look and "too much information" presentation. I think I could help in renewing the look and presentation of the website in a way to make it more appealing and convincing.    In particular, I'm thinking some interactive, real-time simulations and visualizations of voting systems could be a really great tool to have, and I definitely have a lot of ideas on how to approach that subject.

I have an extracurricular passion for advanced math and chemistry, something that will probably determine the "career-oriented" part of my future.  In my free time, I research topics that I find interesting. I have actually learned almost everything that I know about chemistry from my own research, and won first place in a regional Chemistry Olympiad Competition. I wouldn't have mentioned this achievement if I had any other way to demonstrate credibility, such as a college education or a job.  For 5 years, I have been attempting to model a Utopia (I've made progress) and I would be willing to rant about things that I have learned and figured out. I am politically independent, but I was a die-hard Bernie Sanders supporter in the 2016 US presidential election due to his genuine character, honesty, and belief that the government should act in the interests of the people.   I simply want to help this organization be successful, as it seems to be a centralized source for all things related to voting: the problems, the science, and the solutions. I sense a strong theme that the only way to make a morally sound government is to have a logical and mathematical base, that minimizes strategic voting,disproportional representations, and other problems that I either haven't mentioned or am not aware of.   I am not only young but also new to this specific organization. Thus I am eager to prove myself and see what options I have, as well as "spread the word" about the solutions offered by Range voting and the like. </p>

Also, the basics of range voting need to be stated a lot more clearly and briefly, preferably also in video form (compare to cgp grey's video about problems with first past the post https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)  I'd also be willing to donate money if this was a non-profit, so forming a non-profit seems quite essential to me.  I'm wondering if I could move/copy much of the content of this site to a wiki format, which I think would be a low cost, but significant upgrade in web design.  Maybe making a good youtube video about range voting would also be a possibility for me, although both of these things would take quite some time.  I'm somewhat suprised that I could not find a good video about range voting so far.</p>
<p><b>347: Frank Sarah</b>  sarah.christin.111 ;in] gmail /.; com;I studied mathematics and philosophy in Germany and am interested in programming, politics, and lots more. I believe in making a change in this world. In my Masters I have been looking into Rational Choice Theory, providing a method of accounting for immaterial values, like beliefs, in the utility function. Right now I am writing about self-organizing systems, why they yield optimal results and what a proper platform could look like. One example is a political system, where people vote for specific ideas instead of representatives. They should say how important something is to them and how satisfied they are with how it is now, while always being able to change their opinion. The ideas with the highest accumulated difference will then continuously be realized. These votes are supposed to be Range Votes. I did not realize which implications this had, before trying to research how this could bypass Arrows Theorem and stumbling upon your page (thanks to Wikipedia). This is so great!! I have a good friend who already came up with a pretty good model, but it is hard to get the point across to people and we are still working on the prototype... I really hope some people are still active, because I would love to talk about ideas and work on building a working voting system!</p>

<p><b>349: Chris</b> Software Engineer  Theatrical Director  Politics: Eh, weird mix of Libertarian and Democrat/Green Party.    Joining b/c I wholly stand behind the philosophy articulated here. This website simply, elegantly, and clearly describes what range voting is and how it makes so much more sense than any other ranked or exclusive form of voting. I have been rattled by the 2018 election - the results were entirely based on the style of voting we have implemented, based on fear and "lesser of two evils". But it wasn't just the results, it was also the type of conversations that were spurred on; the "oh don't vote for Bernie/Jill Stein/Gary Johnson b/c then its a vote for the opponents" mentality was toxic, and not how we should be deciding our top leaders. I think there is a great public good to be brought about by range voting - we change the way we vote, we'll change the way we think and talk to each other. </p>
