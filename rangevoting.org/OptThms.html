<H2> Theoreticians' attempts to find "optimal" voting systems. (Haven't worked well...) </H2>

<p><b>Condorcet &asymp;1780:</b>
Consider this probability model.  There is some true God-given quality-ordering
among the N candidates.  Each voter if asked "who is better, candidate A or B?"
gets the wrong answer with some fixed probability <i>p</i>.  All voters and all answers
are independent.
Then: Condorcet's "least reversal" voting system elects candidate most-likely to be 
"true" winner.
</p>

<p><b>Flaws:</b> 
a&rArr;Condorcet did not understand prob. theory?
e&rArr;theorem lives in some other world.

Actually, your answers (in a single rank-ordering vote) <i>depend</i>.
(C.L.Dodgson attempted to fix that flaw...)
</li><li>
All systems that always elect Condorcet winners suffer "no show" paradoxes in which
voter gets a better election result (in her view) by refusing to vote than
by casting an honest vote.
</li><li>
They also always are "inconsistent" in the sense that if W wins in district 1 and
in district 2, that does not imply W wins in combined country.
</li><li>
The least-reversal system can declare X "the unique best" candidate... while
simultaneously declaring X "the unique worst" candidate. 
</li><li>
Real human voters use strategy.  They are not honest idiots.
</li>
</ol>


<p><b>D.G.Saari &asymp;1990:</b>
Among "weighted positional" voting systems,
Borda uniquely has
the "fewest paradoxes."
Also, Borda is the unique WP system satisfying both "fairness" and
"reversal symmetry."
</p>

<p><b>Flaws:</b> 
a,b&rArr;<i>who cares</i> about WP systems?
d&rArr;theorem lives in some other world.
<ol type="a">
<li>
It can be shown that <i>all</i> WP voting systems can act <i>arbitrarily crazily</i>
in the sense that (a) for any pair (X, Y) of nontrivial WP systems, and any two orderings
(A, B) among C and C-1 candidates respectively, and any k&isin;{1,2,...,C}
there is an election in which system X outputs societal ordering A,
but after deleting candidate <i>k</i>
and using the same votes, system Y outputs ordering B.

Range voting and Condorcet systems and IRV and approval are not WP systems.
</li><li>
<i>Every</i> WP system elects B and not the Condorcet winner C in pictured situation
(C>B by 7:6, C>A by 7:6).
<small>But Gehrlein, Fishburn, &amp; van Newenhizen 
showed that the probability (assuming each vote is random permutation)
that Borda elects a non-Condorcet-Winner (conditioned on a CW existing)
is about 10% if N=3 and #voters&rarr;&infin;.
They showed Borda <i>minimizes</i> this conditional
probability over all WP systems, for each N&ge;3.</small>

<p><b>W.D.Smith 1999:</b>
Range voting 
<a href="RVstrat.pdf">is</a>
the unique COAF voting system (Compact, One-vote, Additive, Fair)
with "maximum voter expressivity" subject to  "avoiding favorite betrayal."
Also has "max-measure strategically accessible vote-sets."
</p>
<p>
Related theorems, but cleaned up and nicer,
were shown by <a href="PivatoChar.html">Marcus Pivato</a> in 2011-2013.
</p>

<p><b><a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">W.D.Smith 2007:</a></b>
Range features both "immunity to cloning" and
"avoiding favorite betrayal"; but no rank-order system does.
</p>

<p><b><a href="DhillonM.html">Dhillon &amp; Mertens 1999:</a></b>
Range voting is the unique voting system satisfying certain Arrow-like axioms.
