<p>
We believe that IRV leads to 2-party domination.  Is Ireland evidence for that?
Well, since 1921,
Ireland's Dail has been elected by means of 3-to-5-winner multiwinner reweighted STV
<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a> elections, not IRV. 
So Ireland cannot really be used to study IRV
per se, and we would expect it to be a multiparty country.
</p>

<p>
However, Ireland's <i>president</i> really <i>is</i> elected by IRV 
(the single-winner special case of 
STV).  That does not matter terribly much because the
Irish president is a largely ceremonial position whose only real
power worth mentioning is her ability to refer a bill to
the supreme court for the purpose of testing its constitutionality.
(The most powerful person is the PM.)
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, for whatever it is worth, so far every Irish president has been
from one of two parties.  In fact they have all been from just <i>one</i> party
(Fianna Fail) except for Mary Robinson.  The fact that she was able to win without
the support of Fianna Fail for the only time in Irish history,
was a single-time aberration perhaps related to her worldwide fame
(e.g. she won the Nobel Peace Prize), the
fact the FF candidate was linked to scandals,
and the unusual absence of a credible contender from the Fine Gael party.

<p>
As a country
with proportional representation based on reweighted STV, one would
expect Ireland to be a multiparty country.  However,
perhaps because Ireland also features IRV (single winner special case of STV)
elections, that causes it to be more 2-party dominated.

Since the constitution was written in 1937, the prime minister has
always been a member of either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael:
