<H2> Nontoxic cottonseeds </H2>

<p>
Cotton is one of the most widely grown farmed plants.  It produces copious nutritious seeds.
But due to a toxin called "gossypol," people can't eat the seeds &ndash; otherwise
they'd be enough to feed 500 million people per year.
(Correctly processed
cottonseed <i>oil</i>
can be consumed, though, and cottonseeds can also be fed to "ruminant" farm animals in limited
quantities.)
The cotton plant produces the toxin apparently to try to defend against
insect pests and diseases.
</p>

<p>
A succession of genetic engineers figured out how to breed a cotton plant with
100 times less gossypol in its seeds (but still producing gossypol in the rest of the
plant to fend off insects).
