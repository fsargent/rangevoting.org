<H2> Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) and racial minorities </H2>

<p>
It has sometimes been stated (falsely) by IRV-propagandists, that 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> helps minorities.  But in fact, the available evidence 
indicates it
hurts them.

 <small>[<a href="IrvExtreme.html">About the (unrelated?) fact IRV favors "extremists"</a>]</small>
</p>
<p>
To see this, we shall compare minority representation in federal IRV-elected
and plurality-elected seats versus the minority percentages in the population at large, in
the top IRV-using country (Australia) and the top two plurality-using
countries (USA &amp; UK) in years 2005-2008.
We find, e.g, that there are zero racial-minority IRV seatholders...
(We shall also examine some US cities and Ireland.)

<h3> The Australian House (elected via IRV) </h3>

Color photos dated  3 June 2008 of every one of the
150 Australian MPs (their MPs are elected via IRV) are

<b>Every single MP is white,</b>
despite the fact Australia's overall population is

<p>
Also 14.8% said they had "Hispanic or Latino origin" but this is not being counted as a "race."

<p>
For a perhaps-irrelevant blast from the past, you can also see a
<a href="AustralianLabourMPs1901.jpg"> group photograph</a>
of all Australian Labour MPs in 1901.
There were zero racial minorities present then also.
<br>
We can also note that
the probability that 150 randomly drawn Australians would happen to be all-white,
is 0.92<sup>150</sup>&asymp;3.7&times;10<sup>-6</sup>.  
This proves 
(with statistical confidence level 99.9996%) 
that the Australian House is not racially representative.
And one could also argue the US Senate is not either.
One could also note
the US House &amp; Senate 
are not gender-representative either [although that is not a 
<i>min</i>ority problem since
women are a <i>maj</i>ority of the population]. 
This is even more clear since, e.g, the probability 435 coin tosses would
yield &le;73 heads, is 2.1&times;10<sup>-47</sup>, so we can have confidence
<center>
99.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999998% 
</center>
that the US House is gender-biased.
So all these governmental bodies have unrepresentative racial and/or gender compositions,
but the Australian House with <i>zero</i> race-minority members
clearly more-extremely underrepresents minorities than the USA.

<h3> The UK House of Commons  (elected via plurality voting) </h3>

<p>
As of 25 July 2008, it contained
125 female and 521 male members (646 total &ndash; but that
includes
the speaker and his 3 deputies, who do not normally vote).  
<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio/stateparties.cfm">Party</a> breakdowns
are also <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/directories.cfm">available</a>,
but the official House of Commons website does not give a 
racial breakdown (as far as I can tell). 
</p><blockquote>
<small>
From press reports we know this partial information:
there are two black women MPs, namely
Dawn Butler and Diane Abbott;
the only conservative-party black MP is Adam Afriyie;
Keith Vaz is "the longest-serving Asian MP"
and others are Piara Khabra and Ashok Kumar;
there are no Asian women MPs.

Labour MP Shahid Malik was quoted saying

However, that changed slightly in the May 2005 election.

Meanwhile for the population at large (not the MPs) the
2001 census says
</p>

<table bgcolor="lightblue"  border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>White 92.1%</td><td>Black 2%</td><td>Indian 1.8%</td>
<td>Pakistani 1.3%</td>
<td>Mixed race 1.2%</td>
<td>Other 1.6%</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
So the 2008 UK house of commons underrepresents racial minorities by a factor of 3.4
(i.e. 7.9% non-white population vs 2.3% non-white MPs).
</p>

<p>
Because the UK and Australia have the same percentage of whites (92%)
in the population, their Houses are directly comparable.
Assuming Malik's counts from 2005 are valid,
note that the probability that 150 randomly drawn members
of the 659 would be all-white, is
<center>
binomial(509, 13)/binomial(659, 13) &asymp; 0.0336.
</center>
Therefore, the statistical <i>confidence</i> that Australia's IRV election process
disfavors racial minorities (<i><u>compared</u></i> with the UK's plurality election process) is 97%.
</p>
<p>
If we redo the calculation using the 2008 data [646 MPs, 15 colored]
then we instead find that the probability that 150 randomly drawn members
of the 646 would be all-white, is
<center>
binomial(496, 15)/binomial(646, 15) &asymp; 0.0181.
</center>
Based on that, the statistical confidence that Australia's IRV election process
disfavors racial minorities (compared with the UK's plurality process) is 98%.
</p>
<p>
The combined confidence based on <i>both</i> the 2004/2005 and 2007/2008
data sets (I believe, but it has not been verified, that the previous Australian House,
elected in October 2004, also was all-white)
would be considerably higher.

<H3> Takoma Park, Maryland </H3>

<p>
The city of Takoma Park, Maryland adopted instant runoff voting for city council 
and mayoral elections in 2006.  This was in large part due to Rob Richie, head 
of the pro-IRV organization "FairVote" who lives in Takoma Park.
As of the census of 2000, Takoma Park had 
17299 people in 6893 households, and 3949 
families.
Its racial makeup was 
<!--
 residing in the city. The population density was 3,150.6/km sq (8,152.4/mi sq). 
There were 7,187 housing units at an average density of 1,308.9/km sq (3,387.0/mi sq). 
-->
</p><pre>
48.79% White, 
33.97% African American, 
4.36% Asian, 
0.44% Native American, 
0.03% Pacific Islander, 
7.44% from other races, and 
4.97% mixed from two or more races. 
Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.42% of the population.
</pre>

<p>
Since adoption of IRV (I am writing this section in June 2010), every Takoma Park election winner
has been white.
</p>

<H3> Ireland </H3>

<p>
Ireland has always elected its President via IRV.  So far (2010)
no member of a racial (or religious?) minority has ever won.
</p>

<H3> San Francisco, CA </H3>

<p>
San Francisco started using (top-3 bastardized) instant runoff voting in 2004, and
during 2004-2009 held 14 IRV elections.
In all 14 cases, the same winner won as with plain-plurality voting
(i.e. the IRV "first round").   Therefore, there was no change whatever in racial composition
of winners using IRV versus using plain-plurality.
</p>


<a name="conclu"></a>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
Both the US&harr;Australia and
UK&harr;Australia 
contrasts indicate IRV does not favor racial minorities (versus plurality voting).
It disfavors them.  The (smaller) amount of evidence from Takoma Park, San Francisco, and Ireland
also in no way supports the notion IRV favors minorities.
</p>
<p>
<small>
We have made no attempt to find out <i>why</i> IRV disfavors minorities; we merely
focused on <i>whether</i> it does.  But it seems plausibly
logical that IRV would actually help <i>maj</i>orities. The intent with IRV
(vs plain plurality voting) was to try to help merge what otherwise would be
"split" votes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
E.g. if 3 whites run versus 1 black, and all the white votes merge instead of being
split, this would seem to hurt the black relatively.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed it has been claimed that the reason, or at least a big
reason, that (non-instant) runoffs were introduced heavily throughout the USA South in
party primaries during early 1900s, was precisely because of the fear by whites
that due to a white-candidate vote-split, some black would get nominated by the
Democratic party and hence would almost surely win office. Horrors. With the
top-2-runoff, that risk was averted.
(If this theory was correct it might be possible to find evidence for it in all
the old Southern election records.)
Anyhow, whether for that or other reasons, blacks were very effectively shut out
of political office throughout the 'Jim Crow era' about half a century long in the South.
</small>
</p>

<h3> Caveat (and re-examination of our logic) </h3>

<p>
In both Australian, USA, and UK society, there are forces &ndash; which have
nothing to do with the voting system &ndash; causing racial minorities and/or women to be 
underrepresented.  <i>However</i> (provided we agree these 3 societies are basically
similar today) these forces are <i>the same</i>. Therefore they <i>cancel out</i>
and would normally yield
the <i>same</i> degrees of underrepresentation in all 3 societies.   But they do
not.   As we've seen from the data,
Australia with IRV has <i>worse</i> minority-underrepresentation
than the USA and UK.   The underlying cause of this <i>difference</i>, given that
the 3 societies are similar, would have  to be the only way 
those societies differ, namely, THE VOTING SYSTEM.
</p><p>
Now the flaw in this logic is that actually, Australia, USA, and UK 
are <i>not</i> exactly the same in every way aside from the voting system.
There are other differences that may affect things somehow.
Therefore, it is not possible to say for sure the voting system is the cause.
It might be some other unknown cause.  If instead of having data from only 3 countries,
we had data from 100 countries, then we might be a lot more convincing.
</p>
<p>
However, there is no such databank.  We have to be satisfied with the data that
actually exists.  The USA and UK are the top two plurality-using countries in the world 
and Australia
is the top IRV-using country.  No other countries currently come close.
And the USA, UK, and Australia <i>are</i> very similar (same language, same 
ethnic roots mostly, shared culture, many shared aspects of governmental design,
and UK &amp; Australia have same percentage of whites in their populations and only separated
about 100 years ago). 
</p>
<p>
So given this, we suggest to you that <i>based on the data that we have</i>, and until any evidence
comes along to the contrary, you should conclude that IRV disfavors racial minorities.
It is irresponsible to state 
</p>
<blockquote>
"Instant Runoff" voting reform can empower communities of color.
<br>
<small>
[This is the title of a newspaper article by Isaac Peterson III
in the <i>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</i> dated 7/16/2008.  
The <i>Spokesman-Recorder</i> says it is
"the oldest minority owned business in the state of Minnesota...
a newspaper committed to meeting the news and information needs of African Americans."
If you look in
the article, no evidence is given to support the claim in the headline.  There is some
<i>irrelevant</i> "evidence" like 
"The Public Research
Institute
at San Francisco
State University conducted exit polls during two IRV elections in this period,
as did other groups like the Asian Law Caucus. In addition, FairVote conducted
studies
based on precinct analysis of ballots for the 2004 and 2005 elections.
The polls of San Francisco voters' opinions and the precinct analysis of turnout
and use of
rankings in San Francisco demonstrate that:
<ul><li>
Voters of all races and ethnicities strongly preferred IRV over a two-round
runoff system.
</li><li>
voters of all races and ethnicities find IRV easy to use.
</li><li>
IRV increased turnout citywide by 2.7 times, and in the city's six most
racially and socio-economically diverse neighborhoods turnout quadrupled...
</li><li>
An overwhelming majority of voters, including minority voters, reported
understanding
IRV."
</li></ul>
<hr>
That all tells us absolutely nothing about whether IRV favors racial minorities.
It tells us about other things, some of which sound mildly related, but the direct
question of favortism of minorities is not addressed.
And in addition some of those points were misleading; for example when
Rob Richie, head of FairVote, got his hometown Takoma Park MD to try IRV, turnout
was very poor &ndash; of the 17,299 total city population, only 1,010 people IRV-voted &ndash;
and despite Takoma Park's 34% black population, zero minorities hold office as of 2008 &ndash;
and in SF a large percentage of voters found IRV hard to understand and IRV countries
consistently
<a href="SPRates.html">exhibit</a> some of the highest ballot-spoilage rates in the world
&ndash;
including San Francisco had 7&times; the ballot spoilage in IRV than plurality races &ndash;
if Peterson had presented that data instead, things would look different.

We repeat.  My only actual direct
evidence on the topic indicates that IRV <i>dis</i>favors minorities.
