<H1> The dispute about how old bees are </H1>

<p>
The age of bees is disputed.
The dispute probably eventually will be resolvable using "DNA clock" evidence, but
so far, nobody has tried.
</p>
<p>
The oldest known stingless bee fossil was thought to be 74-94 million years old
but was re-estimated to have been only 65-70 million years old.
The oldest honeybee fossils are 22-25 million years old.
Eusocialization is presumed already to have
occurred by the times of those fossilizations
since they were sterile "worker" bees.

<i>But</i> flowers presumably co-evolved with bees and are at least 130 million years old.
About 100 small nests, apparently each
collaboratively constructed 207-220 million years ago
by early kinds of carpenter and miner bees to house 10-100 individuals,
were found in Arizona's petrified forest in fossilized wood and sand.
Chemical analysis  
showed they contained some of
the organic compounds of the sort bees excrete from their Dufour
glands to coat their nest walls.
If so, then bees came <i>before</i> flowers.

If bees were already around before flowers, then
that would make it much easier to understand why flowers appeared and
diversified very suddenly (old puzzle noted by Darwin):  The flowers suddenly
saw how to take advantage of the bees (a pre-existing resource for them) and
then both co-adapted rapidly.
But it would make it much harder to understand: why are there not still some
bee-types still around today which are not into flowers?
</p>
<p>
Engel (p.151) attacked Hasiotis' "fossil bee nests,"
claiming the chemical findings were "not diagnostic
for bees at all" and these nests actually were probably "beetle galleries."
Engel: "the bees are a derived, monophyletic group of the spheciform wasps and
presumably arose sometime in the earliest mid-Cretaceous after the origin of angiosperms...
between 125-90 million years ago...
the diversification of bees must have coincided with the angiosperm radiations 130-90 Mya and
[especially] 115-90... Bees arose <i>after</i> flowers."

<b>Conclusion:</b>
Eusocial bees are at least 65 million years old,
but some kinds of bees with some degree of sociality may have existed
as long as 220 million years ago (before flowers existed).
