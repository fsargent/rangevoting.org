</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">It's that time of the year again. Election 
time. And what are we hearing? Don't waste your vote by voting for anyone 
but a Republican or Democrat. Doing so may cause one or the other to 
lose because they didn't get your support.</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Let's cut to the chase and call this 
for what it is: Arrogance &ndash;
arrogance to the <i>n</i>th degree. You see, 
the two major parties are in effect saying they OWN your vote. 
If you don't vote for either a Republican or Democrat then you are just 
plain ignorant, or stupid, or a combination of both. You can't be trusted 
to make up your own mind. Too many choices may confuse the voter &ndash; 
so let's limit the choices.</font><br></p>
<!-- <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The following fable exposes this argument's 
fallacy.</font><br></p> -->
<hr>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">You enter a restaurant and when handed 
the menu you see only two items &ndash; Chicken or Turkey. You call the 
waiter over and ask: &quot;Is this all you ever have &ndash; Chicken or Turkey? 
For once I want a nice red steak!&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The waiter looks at you, shakes his head 
and says: &quot;Of course we have other items. Do you see the very tiny 
print on the back of the menu? &#39;Other items.&#39; That means you 
can order what you like as long as we have it. But we think you should 
only order either the Chicken or Turkey. We refuse to even advertise 
the other selections. You'd just be throwing your money away anyway 
because most people like our Chicken or Turkey dinners. We know exactly 
how to prepare those meals. Steak is an &#39;Other Item.&#39; We don't 
have much experience there.&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">
You respond:</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Listen &ndash; I'm sick and tired of 
eating Chicken or Turkey. They both taste and look almost the same and 
no matter how many times you say you'll prepare it to order &ndash; it all 
comes out the same in the end. Same sauce, same color, same taste. Give 
me a steak!&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The waiter then calls his boss over and 
explains to him that you want to buy a steak dinner.</font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Goodness gracious NO!&quot; he 
exclaims. &quot;Don't you know that by ordering steak you won't be sure 
of how it will taste? We almost NEVER cook steaks. Stick with what we 
do best &ndash; Chicken or Turkey. That's what we think is the right choice 
for you.&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">By now you are getting suspicious. &quot;Why 
is it that when I actually do see a steak dinner it always seems to 
be a better bargain? 
It sizzles.  It looks great.  It promises to fill me up. 
It even costs less then the Chicken or Turkey! Obviously your 
chef can cook it. Give me the steak!&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Please!&quot; implore both the 
waiter and his boss. &quot;If you order the steak &ndash; maybe someone 
else will do the same. We've ordered enough Chicken and Turkey for everyone. 
If you persist &ndash; we might actually have to throw out either some Chicken 
or Turkey! You wouldn't want that, would you?&quot;</font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">You reply: &quot;I couldn't care less about how 
many Chickens or Turkeys you have. You must have a whole lot, because 
that's all that's on the menu. But that's your problem. I've eaten Chicken 
and Turkey until it's coming out of my ears. Every time you promise 
me that they are fresh, tasty and won't cost much. Every time I get 
them they are the same stale old birds as before &ndash; the only difference 
is that each time I come in they're more expensive. Give me the damn 
steak!&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The waiter looks at his boss and his 
boss looks at his waiter. &quot;If you insist&quot;, they both growl, 
&quot;you can have a steak. But .... just to make sure that no one else 
is bothered by your selfishness we insist that you sit behind this screen 
and eat as quietly as you can. In fact &ndash; we're going to move the screen, 
the table and you outside in the backyard. That will keep anyone else 
from making the same mistake.&quot;</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">And by the way &ndash; we just made new menus. 
It will be even harder to find &#39;Other Items&#39; next time you 
come. We suggest that you don't even ask!&quot;</font><br></p>
<hr>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">And so it is with third party candidates. 
The media, the reporters, the politicians are all telling you that you 
should vote either Republican or Democrat, knowing full well that there 
is a complete menu of other more interesting candidates on the ballot 
- but making darn sure you never hear about them. Even if you insist, 
third party candidates are hidden away on the back pages.</font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">It's for your own good, of course. Because 
&quot;everyone&quot; knows that Republicans or Democrats are the 
only selections to make.</font><br></p>
