<H2> Top Two (non-instant) Runoff versus "Instant" runoff (executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
In the "top two runoff" (T2R) system, one of the most common election systems in the world (2013) 
there is a <a hrf="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style 
election whose top two finishers go on to a second round head-to-head 
runoff election.  (Unless somebody got over 50% in round 1, in which case most
places skip the second round.)
</li><li>
In the "instant runoff" system (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>), 
pushed by some as an improvement,
each "vote" is  a rank-ordering of the candidates.  We repeatedly eliminate
(both from the election and all ballots) the
candidate ranked top on the fewest ballots.
Eventually only one remains &ndash; the winner.  In this way 
the two (or more) rounds in a runoff scheme get simulated using only a single election.  
</li><li>
Unfortunately the IRV system is more complicated for both voters and counters, which
often causes <a href="VermontIrvCost.html">cost</a>
increases (as well as sometimes-vast increases in 
ballot-<a href="SpoilExec.html">spoilage</a>
rates)
despite the fact the second round is not needed &ndash;
and 
it loses the benefit of the two-round system that the press will examine
the two contenders in a lot more detail between rounds, enabling voters to then 
reconsider and make a more-informed choice.
</li><li>
We <a href="TTRvsIRVrevdata.html">examined</a>
the data from a large set of elections and found a very significant difference
between the 2-round systems and its instant "simulation":
the IRV winner is much more (about 3 times more)
often the same as the winner of the first round.
In other words, that "re-consideration" by the voters between rounds in
the two-round system, really
does make a big difference, and really is a big advantage that IRV loses.
</li><li>
Specifically, in IRV elections, the winner is the same as the first round winner 95% of
the time.  With two round (genuine) runoff, the winner is the same only 84% of the time.
This is a very big difference, and hence we suspect it is well worth having that second round.
</li><li>
There is <a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">another</a>
very significant difference between IRV and T2R (which may be related): the countries that use IRV
always (so far) rapidly develop massive and permanent 2-party domination in IRV seats.
<small>
Third parties find it virtually impossible to win, for example in Australia their
(IRV-elected) house recently contained zero third-party members 3 times in a row, despite every
seat being contested by more than 2 parties each time.  (Do not confuse
their House with the Senate, which is not elected with IRV.) Austrialia's third
<a href="AusIRV.html">parties</a>
all want to abolish IRV,
as do Australia's <a href="AusIRV.html#poll">citizens</a>.
</small>
However, the countries that use T2R, usually obtain a more healthy status
in which more than just 2 parties can and do win.
</li><li>
The USA pro-IRV propaganda group "FairVote" unfortunately has been able to 
eliminate 2-round runoffs
in favor of instant ones in a number of places in the USA, most notably San Francisco.
This probably <i>hurt</i> USA democracy.  It would be much better if they focused on replacing
<i>one</i>-round plurality elections by IRV (if they are going to push IRV, which is not
as good an idea as <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>) because that 
far more clearly would represent
an <i>improvement</i>.
