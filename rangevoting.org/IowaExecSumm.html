<H2>  Iowa 2008 Caucuses &ndash; a perfect stage for range voting  (Executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>  Iowa caucuses get tremendous media attention and have tremendous
impact despite small Iowa population. Perfect stage
to get publicity for range voting.
</li>
<li>  Appears can change the rules without altering state or federal
law, only Dem. &amp; Repub. party internal procedures, central committee.
Easier target.
</li>
<li>  Iowa caucuses use pen &amp; paper ballots &amp; manual totaling (hand calculators
or adding machines).
Hence can easily institute single-digit range voting &ndash; essentially no complexity penalty
versus approval &amp; plurality.
</li>
<li>  Don't make these <i>mistakes</i>: Approval Voting=<i>bad</i> 
(<a href="IowaSumm.html#ComputerSim">computer simulations</a>
of Iowa
show major quality deficit of AV versus Range Voting, and range is quite 
likely to have a different winner from AV and plurality, which would have a huge
positive mental
impact); IRV=<i>bad</i> (much worse risk of big screwup than with range &ndash; if
that happens, huge blow for voting reform and the party that tried it
&ndash; remember, the risk of a screwup with the new
Iowa system is the <i>only</i> downside of this whole thing, and Range <i>reduces</i>
that downside risk whereas IRV <i>increases</i> it &ndash; also IRV much harder to handle
logistically/administratively).
</li>
<li> Both the Dems &amp; Repubs (at all levels: rank-and-file members countrywide
and Iowa-wide, Iowa state party leaders, national party leaders), 
are <i>motivated</i> to <i>want</i> to use
range so they can get a <a href="PlurPrim.html">better presidential nominee</a>,
and seem in favor of reform, and get free publicity;  Iowans may also
be in favor of change since many may believe Kerry (or Bush) was a mistake by them.
</li>
<li>  Because expect 10 Dem &amp; 10 Repub candidates, range voting will
have maximized <i>quality advantage</i> versus
plurality &amp; approval.
</li>
<li>  
Third parties want range voting and their supporters constitute at least 1% and 
arguably as much as 40% of society.  They could swing the election.  It is
worth catering to their desires, especially when it also benefits everybody
else including the major parties and all USA-wide.
</li>
<li>  
Leads to voter education, reform, free good publicity beneficial for all involved,
and better US presidential candidates.
</li>
</ol>
