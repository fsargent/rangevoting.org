<a href="FunnyElections.html#Robinson">This election</a>
is often cited by <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
proponents as an example of a
great success for IRV. But let us examine it.
It turns out that <i>despite</i> the very-partial report above
from the Irish Election authority, we still can discern pathologies.
</p>
<!--
In 1990 the second term of Dr. Patrick Hillery as President of Ireland was due to end.
in January, Labour Party leader Dick Spring shocked the country when he told RTE
radio 1's <i>This Week</i>
that Labour was determined to run a candidate and force the first real
presidential contest since 1973.
-->

<h3> "Participation failure" pathology (&amp; also "favorite-betrayal" failure) </h3>

<p>
Suppose we magically
added a new "Currie County" to Ireland comprising
344,364 <i>new identical voters</i>, each voting Currie&gt;Robinson&gt;Lenihan.
[This is fairly realistic, since Currie-top voters did in fact prefer
Robinson over Lenihan by a 6:1 ratio;
the Currie votes split (77%, 14%, 9%) for (R, L, untransferable).]
</p><p>
Then Robinson would have been eliminated in round 1.
</p><p>
Let us assume that the Robinson votes would have
transferred
<center>
  (&le;52, &ge;39, 9)% to (Currie, Lenihan, untransferable), 
</center>
or let us merely
assume that those numbers were only
(upper, lower, equal) bounds, respectively, as
I've indicated with the "&le;" and "&ge;" signs.
This also is realistic.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Irish politics interlude</b> [from Irishman Ivan Ryan]:<br>
Lenihan was the subject of a controversy, so it is reasonable to
assume that his support was substantially party based (core FF voters
are probably in the region of 35-40%... perhaps less so now).
An FF-core voter would likely vote against an FG candidate. 
The flip side of this was
seen when the FG candidate (Currie) was eliminated; 77% voted 2nd choice
against FF.
<br><br>
However, FG/Labour have closer ties than FF/Labour as FG has no hope of
forming a government without Labour.  FF on the other hand has a
realistic chance of forming a government with the support of either smaller
parties (or Labour). So there probably would be at least a 2-1 split in
FG second-place votes in favour of Robinson.
[End of Ryan quote]<br><br> 
Finally, Lenihan was considerably more popular than Currie as we see from 
both the vote and a poll in the 10 October <i>Irish Times</i> indicating
FF-over-FG support by about 49% to 24%.  Hence the majority of Robinson's
2nd-preference votes probably would have gone to Lenihan.
</blockquote>
<p>
So this (&le;52, &ge;39, 9) assumption seems quite plausibly realistic.
It is actually probable Lenihan
would get considerably more than 39% of Robinson transfers,
so our assumption seems quite comfortably satisfied.
<!--[For example if the Robinson &amp; Lenihan voters preferred
Currie&gt;Robinson 17% of the time (same 17% as in the voter
population as a whole) and even if <i>all</i> of those 17% were
a <i>subset</i> of the Robinson voters, and even if <i>all</i> of them
cast a valid vote (no transfer failures
afflicting Currie at all) then still only 36% of the
Robinson votes would transfer to Currie,
comfortably obeying our assumption.]-->
</p><p>
OK. Under this assumption, the first round totals
</p>
<pre>
Currie  612266         would have become after         Currie &le;930644
Lenihan 694484         the Robinson-transfers          Lenihan&ge;933267 (wins)
                                         untransferable=dumped=61227.
</pre>

<p>
<b><u>Conclusion:</u></b>
In this case the new Currie voters would have made a <i>big mistake</i> by
voting honestly, since their Lenihan-last votes would have made the
hated Lenihan win. 
They would have been better off "staying home" and
not voting (as, in fact, they did) or better off "betraying" their
favorite Currie and voting Robinson top instead (as, in fact,
considerable numbers of them perhaps did).  This election thus had (what voting theorists call)
a "<b>no-show paradox</b>."

<h3>
Monotonicity failure and/or Favorite-betrayal failure 
</h3>
<p>
Consider the 694,484 Lenihan voters.
Some voted 
Lenihan&gt;Robinson&gt;Currie;
others voted
Lenihan&gt;Currie&gt;Robinson.
<i>Suppose</i>
that 344,364 (i.e. 49.6%) of them had voted
the latter way.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Warning:</b> This is not a very realistic assumption.  As we said, most FF voters
would be inclined against FG, so assuming this many Lenihan voters chose FG second, is
unlikely. Nevertheless, let us explore the consequences of this assumption, then only
later <a href="#ReEx">re-examine</a> the assumption itself.
</blockquote>
<p>
Then those 344,364 voters would have been <i>foolish</i> to have
thus-voted honestly since 
(as the official election results show) 
that caused the hated Robinson to win.
If they had instead <i>strategically betrayed</i> their
favorite Lenihan to instead vote Currie top, then 
<ol>
<li>
Lenihan would
have been eliminated in round 1 whereupon 
</li><li>
Currie would have won, which these voters
would have preferred. 
</li><li>
Indeed &ndash; assuming (now entirely realistically) that
the Robinson voters
would have 2nd-choiced Lenihan more often than Currie &ndash; 
then (in a situation just like this <i>but</i>
featuring enough extra Currie voters so that fewer Lenihan voters had to 
be dishonest)
their favorite <i>Lenihan</i> would have <i>won!</i>
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
So this election is an example of <b>favorite-betrayal failure:</b>
under our assumption about the composition of Lenihan voters, the act of
honestly voting for their favorite 
(Lenihan) was a stupid mistake that caused their most-hated candidate (Robinson) to win.
Smarter was to dishonestly vote Currie.
</p>
<p>
<b>But it gets crazier</b>, as we hinted at above in point (3).
The altered-version of this election with 612264 Currie voters (the extras 
added from "Currie County")
would have been an example of
<b>monotonicity-failure:</b>
</p>
<hr>
<table bgcolor="#ffcccc"><tr><td>
<a name="Conclu2"></a>
<p>
<b><u>Conclusion:</u></b>
These 344,364 Lenihan voters actually made Lenihan+Currie lose by voting for
them and would have made Currie win [which they preferred over what happened] by 
strategically voting against Lenihan.
Further, in the altered-election with extra (in total 612264 due to
344362 from a "new County") Currie voters
(which Lenihan still wins), 
if anywhere between 2 and 82221 Lenihan voters (in percentage terms
0-12% of them) then chose to vote strategically for Currie
instead of Lenihan, that actually would have made <i>Lenihan</i> win!!
</p>
</td></tr></table>
<hr>
<a name="ReEx"></a>
<blockquote>
<b>Re-examination:</b> Note in the altered election
it <i>doesn't matter</i> whether our 49.6%-assumption
was unrealistic.  The fact is, <i>whether or not</i> it was valid,
12% of Lenihan's supporters <i>still</i> could have made Lenihan win by
instead voting for Currie.  They would have been
strategically stupid to all vote for Lenihan.
That's just a fact.
</blockquote>

<a name="hybrid"></a>
<h3> What kind of pathology was that last one, anyhow? </h3>

<p>
<b>It seems clearest to regard this election as suffering from a <i>hybrid</i> form
of the 
"non-monotonicity" (<a href="Monotone.html">type-II</a>)
and "no-show" paradoxes.</b>  Specifically, if
</p>
<table bgcolor="#ffcccc"><tr><td>
<p>
(a) 344362 new "Currie&gt;Robinson&gt;Lenihan" voters had appeared <i>and</i>
<br>
(b) 2-to-82221 Lenihan-top voters had switched to Currie-top 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
(the non-top parts of their votes don't matter, so we can if we want make
them switch from "Lenihan&gt;Currie&gt;Robinson" to "Currie&gt;Robinson&gt;Lenihan"),
<br>
leaving everything else unchanged, that would have made Lenihan win.  
</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
The (a) part is the no-show component of the paradox, and
the (b) part is the non-monotonicity.   
</p><p>
We therefore are <i>certain</I> 
that either this election yielded the wrong winner (Robinson) or that the 
thus-modified election would have yielded the wrong winner (Lenihan) or both.
</p>


<a name="Conclu4"></a>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>
In the whole of (central govt, i.e. not counting lower level such as county and town, elections) 
Irish history so far (up to 2007) there has only been a single 
IRV election in which the winner differed from 
the plain-plurality winner, i.e. in which the
Irish use of IRV vote-transfers actually directly <i>mattered</i>.
</p>
<p>
This (1990) was it.
<small>
(And actually, Irish mayors are not directly elected and nor are county heads, so it may be
that the President is the <i>only</i> IRV-elected post in the country at any level of 
government, in which case this is the only IRV election
where IRV made a difference in all of Irish history.)
</small>
</p>
<p>
In this single example of Irish IRV success, 
the election exhibited several pathologies.
Lenihan could quite justifiably have complained (if he had realized this!)
that he deserved to win:
</p>
<hr>
<table bgcolor="#ffcccc"><tr><td>
<ol>
<li>
If a whole new county had magically appeared with 344364 new voters, all of them
supporting my most-hated rival and ranking me in last place...
then I would have won!
</li>
<li>
If (in <i>addition</i> to having that new county now packed with just 34436<i>2</i>
Currie supporters)
12% of <i>my</i> supporters had switched their vote to my most-hated rival Currie
while ranking me <i>last</i> &ndash;
then I would have won! 
<small>(Although: <i>without</i> my supporters switching over to Currie in this way, I 
would have lost?!?!)</small>
</li>
<li>
So why the heck didn't I win?
</li>
</ol>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
Mind you, we aren't complaining that Robinson won.  That 
<a href="Lenihan.html">worked out well</a> for Ireland.
We are complaining that IRV malfunctioned, or at least, that its legitimacy
was dubious in this case.  If <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>
or <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voting had been used, there
would have been no such dubiousness; we believe Robinson would have clearly won
(or perhaps Lenihan?), <i>and</i> definitely,
none of these three pathologies are even <i>possible</i> with approval and range.
