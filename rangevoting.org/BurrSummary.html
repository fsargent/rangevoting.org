<H2> "Burr's dilemma" flaw in Approval voting system &ndash; Executive Summary </H2>

<ol><li>
The so-called "Burr Dilemma" is a problem with <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting
pointed out (and named) by
Professor <a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/nageljh.html">Jack H. Nagel</a>
(Univ. of Pennsylvania) in 2007.  
(Actually it is probably <i>mis</i>named since this problem actually did <i>not</i> happen in the 
Burr 1800 election &ndash; Burr &amp; Jefferson still placed top.)
</li><li>
The problem arises when two similar candidates A,B appear to be the "frontrunners."
Then voters are strategically motivated to approve one but not the other.
</li><li>
This generates a "vote-split" between A and B, which if the split is even-enough could
be enough to permit the far-less-liked candidate C to win &ndash; disaster.  
(Both A and B would have been far ahead of
C with "honest" votes, the problem is caused by strategic exaggerated votes.
The usual thinking had been that
with approval voting there is no such thing as vote-splitting, and Nagel's point
was that this Burr-effect could cause it to happen.)
</li><li>
This problem is lessened, but not eliminated, with <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
since voters could then provide a vote such as
A=99, B=80, C=0.
</li><li>
Problem also lessened with better pre-election polling: if the voters <i>knew</i> C was 
thus-likely to win, then A and B would <i>not</i> be the two "frontrunners" (since C would be) 
and hence {A,B}-voters would be strategically motivated to place their approval thresholds 
between C and {A,B}... and the problem would disappear or diminish.  
</li><li>
Also, C-supporters if they felt A,B
were frontrunners, would be motivated not to "waste their vote" by approving C only; they would
instead approve C <i>and one</I> among {A,B}.  
This too would <A href="AppCW.html">eliminate</a> or diminish the problem.  
<blockquote>
It is unsymmetrical/illogical to presume only the {A,B}-supporters
would strategically exaggerate 
but not the C-supporters.  The problem arises from this <I>presumption</i>.
If the problem is genuine it is because of unsymmetrical/illogical human psychology, not
logical strategy.  This kind of illogical thinking actually <i>is</i> logical under
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, and one may criticize Nagel as being
"trapped in old-fashioned plurality-based voting thinking" rather than genuinely analysing
the sort of thinking that would happen with approval voting.  Nagel's response would
(I think?) be that A &amp; B would trigger the asymmetry because of an infighting-driven 
"retaliatory spiral."  (That again definitely did not happen in the Burr 1800 election,
with Burr indeed stating he would be happy if Jefferson won.  Indeed, the main attempt
to savage Burr so that Jefferson could win was in fact organized by Burr &amp; Jefferson's
<i>enemy</I> A.Hamilton, thus Nagel's Burr-1800-example actually supports the notion the
<i>C</I>-voters would strategize and <i>not</i> the {A,B}-supporters, 
exactly the opposite of Nagel's thinking!)
</blockquote>
Because our
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a> computer
simulations employed thus-logical strategic voters
(in those sims involving strategic voters) the BR measurements were unable to see this 
whole problem (or only saw a small effect from it).
</li><li>
The only fairly-clear example known to me of an election which looks like it would have
been victimized by the Burr Dilemma (if approval voting had been employed) is
<a href="FunnyElections.html#port86">Portugal 1986</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Burr Dilemma presumably
<i>is</i> a genuine problem for approval and range voting, but it seems not to 
cause a great deal of <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.
In other words, it numerically seems not to be a big enough problem to prevent range from 
being superior
to, e.g. Instant Runoff Voting (IRV).  And IRV <A href="IRVburr.html">also</a>
can experience Burr-like
pathologies.  (And so can <a href="IncentToExagg.html">many other</a>
voting methods.)
