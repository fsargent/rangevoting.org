                              <p>This, evidently, is the system of P. R.
                                with the single transferable vote. It
                                falls short in not providing for the
                                expression on one ballot of several

                                public elections with secret voting.
                                But, on the other hand, it is superior
                                in principle to the first plans which
                                many years later did make such
                                provision. Unlike those plans it
                                provides not only for the transfer of
                                surplus votes but also for the transfer
                                of votes from weaker to stronger

                                Council of at least 15 members, a body

                                Consid'rant, the celebrated disciple of
                                Fourier, as early as 1834. In 1842 it
                                was proposed to the Council of the
                                canton of <st1:city w:st="on">Geneva</st1:city>,
                                at the suggestion of Consid'rant, then

                                Constituent Assembly. In 1844 it was set
                                forth by Thomas Gilpin of <st1:place
                                  w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:city></st1:place>,
                                in a form superior to Consid'rant's, in

                                reproduced in Appendix VIII. This
                                pamphlet of Gilpin's was apparently the
                                first explanation of a thoroughgoing
                                proportional system that was ever
                                printed. In 1846 Consid'rant, again in
                                Switzerland, set forth his system, with
                                a masterly defense of the general
                                principle of proportional

                                set up in that year. "The proposition
                                excited the astonishment of the

                                Though Gilpin's system was much more
                                fully developed than Consid'rant's, it
                                was the latter's memorial of 1846, not
                                Gilpin's pamphlet, which influenced the
                                Swiss writer Morin, who published a book
                                on the list system in 1861, and the
                                founders of the <i>Association
                                  Reformiste</i> of Geneva, founded in
                                1865, who in turn secured the adoption
                                of a list system in Ticino, Geneva, and
                                other cantons of Switzerland. In all
                                probability Gilpin's work was not seen

                              <p>Andrae intended his method to be
                                applied at large to the election of the

                                Legislative Council of the federated

                                were to be directly elected under the
                                Constitution of 1855. Against Andrae's
                                protest the territory was divided into
                                several districts. Since, of the

                                districts, Andrae's proportional system
                                affected only the election of twenty-six
                                at the polls. It was used also, however,
                                for twenty-nine of the thirty additional
                                members who were elected by the members
                                of the representative assemblies of the

                                Besides the 59 members we have mentioned
                                the Rigsraad contained 20 members named
                                by the Crown and one elected by the

                                of Lauenburg. The Andrae system thus
                                applied to the election of 55 out of a

                              <p>SECTION 22, The election is opened by
                                the chairman, and it commences with his
                                counting the ballots sent in. The
                                resulting number is divided by the
                                number of members to be elected to the

                                any fraction that may be present, the
                                electoral basis in the manner prescribed
                                by the following section.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>SECTION 23. After placing the ballots
                                in an urn, and mixing them there, the
                                chairman draws them out one by one and
                                provides them with serial numbers and
                                reads aloud the top name of each ballot,
                                which name is at the same time recorded
                                by two other members of the electoral
                                committee. Ballots on which the same
                                name is written in the top place are
                                placed together, and as soon as a name
                                has recurred so often that the
                                corresponding votes amount to the
                                quotient determined according to Section
                                22, the reading of the ballots is
                                stopped. When the number of votes thus
                                recorded has been verified by a second
                                counting, the candidate in question is
                                declared elected. The ballots thus
                                counted and verified are now put aside
                                and not considered any more. Now the
                                reading-out of the remaining ballots is
                                resumed, in such a manner, however, that
                                whenever the name of the candidate
                                already elected appears in first place
                                on any ballot, it is struck out, and the
                                next name is regarded as name number one
                                on that ballot. If the before-mentioned
                                quotient appears again in favor of some
                                other candidate, the procedure just
                                described is taken again, and when this
                                election has been thus determined, the
                                reading-out is continued and the
                                procedure provided followed, care being
                                taken to strike out, when they
                                re-appear, the names of those already
                                elected. In this way the process
                                continues until all the ballots have
                                been read.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>SECTION 24. If in this manner
                                [referring to the machinery of election
                                outlined in the preceding sections] the
                                entire number of elections which the
                                district requires is not obtained,
                                examination shall be made to find those

                                already elected, have obtained the
                                greatest number of votes read. And from
                                these candidates the remaining seats are
                                filled according to plurality of votes.
                                No candidate, however, shall be elected
                                who has not obtained votes amounting to
                                more than half the quotient
                                beforementioned. In case of candidates'

                                a number that would make them eligible,
                                the choice between such candidates shall
                                be made by lot.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>SECTION 25. In the event that all the
                                seats have not yet been filled, the
                                reading of all the ballots is to be
                                resumed in such a way that the remaining
                                seats are filled by those candidates not
                                already elected whose names are

                                ballots. These elections are to be&nbsp;<a

                                is to be made by lot. <b><sup><span

                              <p>SECTION 26. When a single member only
                                is to be elected, the method of election
                                prescribed in Sections 22-25 is not
                                followed. Election in such a case is
                                determined by a simple [relative]
                                majority of votes. In the event of

                              <p>Andrae's method was a great advance
                                over any previous one in its provision
                                for the expression of alternative
                                choices on the same ballot. It was
                                inferior to that of Thomas Wright Hill
                                in that it did not provide for the

                                candidates. Like Hill's plan it made the<a

                                officer, and a Conservative. For some
                                years, ending in 1854, he was professor
                                of mathematics and mechanics at the
                                national military college. In that year
                                he became Minister of Finance, in 1856
                                Prime Minister. Though thoroughly
                                convinced of the soundness of his method
                                of electing representatives and ready to
                                defend it in the cabinet or the
                                parliament, he made no effort to bring
                                it to the attention of scientific men
                                and statesmen in other countries, much
                                less to defend his claim as an inventor.
                                He seemed surprised that devising a
                                political method so obvious and so
                                simple should be regarded as reflecting
                                much glory on anybody's intellectual
                                powers. When the Italian statesman
                                Perruzzi and Signora Perruzzi, after
                                visiting Andrae, wrote in the name of
                                the proportionalists of Italy asking him

                                Italy, Andrae replied: <i

                                Praised by a thinker honored throughout
                                the western world, Hare became famous
                                himself; and even when, in 1863, the

                                similar system, which had been used in
                                public elections before Hare had
                                published his first pamphlet, the
                                prestige of Hare was so great that he
                                held his place in the minds of most men
                                as the principal inventor of the

                                Andrae's, as advocated by him in 1855,

                                those Andrac proposed and preferred.
                                After 1865, however, when Hare adopted
                                the rule for dropping the lowest
                                candidates one after another and
                                transferring their ballots, his system
                                became more complete and excellent than
                                Andrae's.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>Starting with Hare's improved system as
                                a basis, various refinements have been
                                adopted or suggested from time to time.
                                Some of these are incorporated in the
                                American and the British rules set forth
                                in Appendix IV. Others are discussed in
                                Appendix VI. The most important
                                modification and the one most generally
                                accepted is the reduction of the
                                quota'in a five-member district from
                                one-fifth of the total vote, as proposed
                                by Hill, Andrae, and Hare, to barely
                                more than a sixth. This modification was
                                apparently first suggested by H. R.

                                Strange as it may seem, the energetic
                                propaganda of Hare and Mill first bore
                                fruit in the adoption and extension of
                                the list forms of P. R. described in
                                Chapter V and Appendix VII. For Hare and
                                Mill were the direct inspiration of the
                                P. R. movement in Switzerland, where the
                                list type of P. R. was first agitated.
                                In 1882 a modified form of the Hare
                                system was proposed for elections in <st1:place

                                which do not yet use P.R. (January,
                                1926) there are influential movements
                                for its adoption. In France P. R. has
                                been championed by statesmen of such
                                varying views as Jaur's, Briand, and
                                Poincar'. In 1919 a P. R. proposal was
                                passed by the Chamber of Deputies but
                                rejected by the Senate. The compromise

                                the political life of the day, became
                                engrossed in other affairs. The Society
                                was never dissolved, but its committee

                              <p>In 1905 Leonard Courtney was induced by
                                John H. Humphreys to address a meeting
                                on P. R. in a suburb of <st1:place

                                members of the old committee with some
                                of the new friends of the reform. The
                                first public meeting of the revived
                                Society was held in <st1:place

                                on May 4th. From that time Mr. Courtney
                                (after 1906 Lord Courtney of Penwith)
                                gave the cause his continuous and active
                                support. Until his death in 1918 he was
                                the most inspiring and influential voice
                                in the British movement. Others who have
                                served the cause long and well are the

                                years after 1905 he served the British
                                Society as Honorary Secretary. Since
                                1912 he has served it as secretary on a

                                a result of suggestions made by him to

                                Hare system of proportional
                                representation, regarding it as too

                                not call it by that name. Apparently to
                                emphasize the voter's privilege of
                                either cumulating his vote or not as he

                                In April, 1870, the Hare system of
                                proportional representation was used by
                                the Alumni of Harvard for the nomination
                                of Overseers of the College. This was
                                the first test of the system in an
                                election of importance in <st1:country-region
                                  w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>,
                                or, so far as we know, anywhere except
                                in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
                                    w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
                                The leader in securing the adoption of
                                the system for this purpose and in
                                conducting the elections was William R.
                                <span style="color:red">Ware</span>, an
                                alumnus of Harvard and a professor in
                                the Massachusetts Institute of
                                Technology. The use of the system was
                                continued by the Harvard Alumni for the
                                elections of 1871 and 1872, but was then
                                given up. Another contribution to the
                                movement by Professor Ware was an
                                anonymous article on proportional
                                representation-by far the most important

                                worked for the reform indefatigably. He
                                favored the Hare system and got the
                                Mechanics Institute of San Francisco,
                                where he spent the latter part of his
                                life, to adopt it. He maintained a wide
                                correspondence with proportionalists at
                                home and abroad.&nbsp; </p>

                                America the "free list system." A "free

                                introduced in the House of

                                issued an excellent little quarterly
                                edited by Mr. Cooley, the <i>Proportional



                                  Representation Review</i>. It
                                contained articles not only by leading
                                American proportionalists, including
                                William Dudley Foulke, John R. Commons,
                                Charles Francis Adams, and Simon Sterne,
                                but by such eminent foreigners as Sir
                                John Lubbock (afterward Lord Avebury),
                                Leonard Courtney (afterward Lord

                                of Geneva. At the end of three years the
                                energy of the organization was somewhat
                                spent. The members were not yet united
                                on a single system of voting. It became
                                hard to raise the funds required to
                                continue the quarterly. The League
                                therefore became less active, and
                                publication of the quarterly was
                                suspended.&nbsp; </p>

                                good deal of attention and elections
                                under the Hare system were conducted by
                                Robert Tyson of Toronto. These
                                demonstrations made a number of converts
                                to the Hare system and revealed Mr.

                                the movement. From 1901 until 1913 the <i>Proportional




                                  Representation Review</i>, supported
                                by a few dozen faithful members of the
                                League and published as a department of
                                one periodical after another, was edited
                                by Mr. Tyson, who served also during
                                most of that time as secretary of the
                                League, which had had Canadians in its
                                membership from its foundation. Through
                                nearly all those years Mr. Tyson, though
                                a man of very small means, gave his
                                services to the cause, like his
                                predecessor, Mr. Cooley, without
                                compensation.&nbsp; </p>

                                favored the Hare system. He initiated
                                the policy, which the League has
                                followed since, of concentrating its
                                efforts on the adoption of P. R. for
                                city councils so as to get actual
                                demonstrations of its merits, if only on
                                a small scale.&nbsp; </p>

                                book, C. G. Hoag, became secretary and

                                In 1913 Mr. Hoag took over from Mr.

                                editorship of the <i>Review.</i> The

                                legislature. In 1908 they secured, by
                                means of the "Initiative," an amendment
                                to the State Constitution prescribing
                                that "provisions may be made by law for

                                measures prescribing P. R. for the
                                legislature they were not so successful.
                                In 1908 a novel plan of P. R., which
                                they worked out in connection with
                                single-member districts, was defeated in
                                the legislature. In 1910 the same plan,
                                submitted to the whole electorate under
                                the provisions of the Initiative, was
                                defeated at the polls. Later two other
                                P. R. plans for the legislature,
                                submitted under the Initiative by the
                                same indefatigable group, were also
                                defeated, the proxy plan in 1912 and the
                                single non-transferable vote in
                                1914.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>Though the defeat of these courageous
                                attempts to introduce P. R. on a
                                state-wide scale was hard for the
                                devoted workers there, it was not,
                                perhaps, without its compensations for
                                the cause in this country. For none of
                                the three plans proposed in Oregon
                                could, in our firm opinion, have given
                                completely satisfactory results; and any
                                weaknesses in a P. R. plan adopted for
                                such important and conspicuous elections
                                would probably have been an obstacle to
                                the use by other American communities of
                                any proportional plan whatever.
                                Physiologically, half a loaf is better
                                than no bread; politically, not always.
                                The use of cumulative voting in <st1:place

                                since 1870, for example, has probably
                                not helped the cause of true
                                representation. So the single
                                non-transferable vote, if it had been
                                adopted by Oregon in 1914, might have
                                retarded rather than hastened the
                                progress of the country towards the
                                general use of election methods not only
                                arithmetically fair but also dependably
                                beneficial in their reactions upon
                                candidates, parties, and voters. We are
                                glad that in this country, as throughout

                                Hoag assumed the secretaryship of the
                                American P. R. League in 1912, P. R.
                                with the single transferable vote had
                                clearly gained the ascendancy in the
                                English-speaking world over other
                                proportional systems, having been
                                adopted for important public elections
                                in two of the British dominions,
                                Australia and South Africa, whereas the
                                list system used in some countries of
                                Continental Europe had not been tried in
                                any English-speaking country. P. R. with
                                the single transferable vote was
                                advocated, too, in the authoritative
                                publications of the British P. R.
                                Society. It had been preferred by the
                                recent secretaries of the American P. R.
                                League, Robert Tyson and William Hoag,
                                and it was preferred, for the reasons
                                given in this book, by the new
                                secretary. Naturally, therefore, as he
                                was free under the new constitution of
                                the League, adopted in 1913, to
                                recommend any system of P. R. that
                                seemed to him best for the purpose in
                                view, he decided to recommend only the
                                Hare system for all purposes for which
                                it seemed at all practicable. This
                                policy has been adhered to ever since,
                                and it has been objected to by only some
                                four or five members of the
                                organization. No list system of P. R.
                                has been adopted for public elections in
                                any English-speaking community.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>As Mr. Hoag was able for some years to
                                give the cause his entire time, the
                                membership and the income of the League
                                grew and the P. R. Review was published
                                again'from October, 1914, independently
                                of any other periodical.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>A favorable opportunity for the trial
                                of proportional representation in some
                                American city was presented at this time
                                by the granting of "home rule"'that is,
                                the right to adopt and amend their own
                                charters'to the cities of several states
                                and by the spread of the "city manager
                                plan" of government. The city manager
                                plan differs from the old plan of
                                government generally used in the United
                                States in that the chief administrator
                                is selected by the representative body,
                                that is, the council or "commission,"
                                instead of being elected at the polls,
                                that he is supposed to be selected
                                solely on the ground of fitness for his
                                administrative duties, and that he can
                                be replaced by the representative body
                                at its pleasure. The plan therefore
                                gives to the representative body
                                complete responsibility for the
                                administration of the city's

                                as for its legislation. In the cities
                                which had thus far adopted the plan the
                                council to which so much power was given
                                had been elected at large by the block

                                elect all the members. For such a
                                purpose the block vote was sure to be
                                unsatisfactory and proportional
                                representation was sure to be
                                appreciated by thoughtful
                                citizens.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>The first of our cities to give
                                proportional representation real

                                The reason that it was the first was
                                merely that the secretary of the League,
                                when on his way to <st1:city w:st="on">Cleveland</st1:city>
                                in 1912 with a day to spare on his
                                hands, asked for a ticket to the last
                                city of some size between <st1:state

                                As the ticket handed to him read to <st1:place
                                  w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Ashtabula</st1:city></st1:place>,
                                he got off at the station of that name,
                                found the town, persuaded one man to
                                bring together seven others to hear
                                about proportional representation that
                                evening, and was fortunate enough to
                                convince the little group that
                                proportional representation should be
                                seriously considered by the city if it
                                revised its charter.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>Later the secretary addressed the
                                Ashtabula Chamber of Commerce, and
                                finally he addressed the official
                                Charter Commission elected to revise the
                                city's government. The commission voted
                                to incorporate P. R. in the charter
                                which it was preparing to submit to the
                                voters. Afterwards, however, it changed
                                its mind, fearing that a charter which
                                contained two such novelties as the city
                                manager plan, which the commission
                                desired, and proportional representation
                                would not secure popular approval. The
                                charter was submitted to the people
                                without P. R. in November, 1914, and
                                adopted in that form. In August, 1915,
                                however, before the first election was
                                carried out under the new charter, a
                                special election was held to vote on an
                                amendment prescribing the Hare system of
                                P. R. for the election of the council.
                                The amendment was carried by a vote of
                                588 to 400. The petition to call the
                                special election and the favorable vote
                                were both due to W. E. Boynton, labor
                                leader and former president of the City
                                Council, a man who commanded the respect
                                of all classes. Mr. Boynton was one of
                                the little group who had heard the
                                secretary's first message in 1912. He
                                had grasped the importance of P. R. at
                                once and had furnished the local
                                leadership necessary to bring the
                                campaign to a successful
                                conclusion.&nbsp; </p>

                                first election because the total number
                                to be elected was 20 and the number
                                elected by unanimous quota was 2.<a

                              <p>10 It would be more correct to say that
                                this was the first representation (in a
                                public body) by <i>unanimous </i>quota.

                              <p>12 These figures differ widely from
                                those given by, Robert Lytton in his
                                report to the British Foreign Office
                                from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city

                                repeated in many books on proportional
                                representation. But Lytton's figures
                                were incorrect, as we learn from
                                Frederik Zeuthen of the Department of
                                the Interior, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city

                                translation, p. 66 f. As we have been
                                unable to reconcile the figures given by
                                these two authorities, we think it
                                likely that our figures in the text are

                                developed in an article by Gergonne the
                                same idea of carrying out elections of
                                representative bodies that I thought I
                                made use of myself for the first time in
                                the October Electoral Law. Gergonne
                                demands that anybody who can manifestly
                                show that he is supported by the votes
                                of a certain number (200) of legitimate
                                voters, shall be recognized as

                              <p>33 In his pamphlet of 1863 Fisher
                                mentioned having given thought to a
                                scheme of proportional representation
                                some years before he learned about
                                Hare's writings. In an appendix to the
                                main paper of his pamphlet of 1866,
                                mentioned in connection with Gilpin
                                above, he explains the matter fully and
                                reproduces the short sketch of his
                                scheme which he had "rather hurriedly
                                written in Paris in the month of June,
                                1857," after an interesting conversation
                                on kindred topics with M. de Tocqueville
                                at the apartment of Mr. George Ticknor.
                                He adds that he "was discouraged from
                                giving it publicity by the impression
                                that it would be listened to by none of
                                our political leaders and would excite
                                little interest in our public. It was
                                only after the publication of Mr. Hare's
                                book, in 1861, which was not seen by the
                                writer for more than a year afterwards,
                                that he determined to put in print his
                                own scheme of voting, so different, yet
                                supported on the same principles." As
                                Fisher was a man of the highest
                                character and standing, the truthfulness
                                of this account is not to be questioned.
                                We may therefore be sure that Fisher
                                committed a plan of proportional
                                representation to writing in the same
                                year that Hare wrote his first pamphlet
                                and long before Hare's ideas on
                                proportional representation had reached

                                elected by P. R.<a name="F043"></a>&nbsp;

                              <p>44 We do not mean to imply, of course,
                                that election officials could not drag
                                out the count or prevent adequate
                                supervision, as they could under any
                                other system, if they were so inclined.
                                In fact the second P. R. count in <st1:city
                                  w:st="on">Cleveland</st1:city> was not
                                well supervised, though it was
                                efficient, and the first P. R. count in
                                <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Cincinnati</st1:city></st1:place>
                                was not as efficient as it might have
                                been, though it was very well
                                supervised.&nbsp; <br>
