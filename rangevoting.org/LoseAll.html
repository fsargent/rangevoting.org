<H2> Example of Plurality voting electing "lose to all" candidate </H2>
<p>
Let the four candidates be A, B, C, and D.
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>28</td><td> A>B>C>D </td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td> B>C>D>A </td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td> C>D>B>A </td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td> D>C>B>A </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In this situation, A would lose to any opponent in a head-to-head election
by a huge 72-to-28 margin, far larger than the hugest "landslide" in US presidential election 
history.  And A is ranked dead last by 72% of the voters.
</p>
<p>
But thanks to the insanely idiotic 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality, aka "first past the post"</a>
voting system, A is elected with 28% of
the vote, beating out everybody else (each with &le;25%).
</p>
<p>
<small>
In the 3-candidate <a href="RandElect.html">random elections model</a>
this happens in approximately 
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p24">one in six</a> plurality 3-candidate elections.
It is plausible that it happened in the <a href="FunnyElections.html#nic06">Nicaraguan 2006
presidential election</a>, and it definitely happened in the 
 <a href="Burlington.html">2009 Burlington (VT) mayor election</a> among the top 3 candidates.
</small>
</p>
<p>

In this example, B beats each opponent pairwise by at least a 53-47 margin and hence
presumably "should" have been the easy winner; and indeed B would have won with both 
Condorcet  and Borda voting.
On the other hand C would have won IRV voting, 
using these ballots.  (B or C also would usually
have won with range or approval voting, but we cannot which tell with certainty because these
ballots have not stated the voters' scores or approval-decisions on the candidates.)
