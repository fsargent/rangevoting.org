<H1> The USA 2014 midterm elections: Manipulated! </H1>

<a href="#WARN"><b>WARNING</b></a> 9 Nov 2014.
</p><p>
<b>ABSTRACT.</b>
Our statistical analysis now looks
pretty solidly convincing that the 2014 midterm elections were manipulated
to favor the Republican side.  We employ both parametric and nonparametric tests;
both work.  The nonparametric (i.e. pretty much model-independent) tests find
in close US senate &amp; state governor elections ("close"
reckoned pre-election by <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/">Cook Political Report</a>)
</p><ul><li>
 99.7% confidence that:
if a state has a Republican Secretary of State, that <i>boosts</i>
the chances that state's elections exhibit larger helping-Republican-signed
discrepancies versus poll predictions.  
</li><li>
99.91% confidence that:
poor post-election audit procedures in a state ("inadequate" reckoned by
<a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/post-election-audits/">VerifiedVoting.org</a>
in 2009) <i>boost</i> the chances of a larger 
absolute discrepancy versus poll predictions.
</li></ul><p>
(Our underlying discrepancy numbers
are taken direct from <a href="https://rangevoting.org/RealClearPolitics.com">RealClearPolitics.com</a>
poll averages.)
The tests which do depend on a model &ndash; normal error distribution &ndash; of polling errors,
find enormous confidences that the state elections with some of the most extreme
discrepancies versus polls, were manipulated. (But we employ a highly conservative estimate,
i.e. expected to be a safe <i>over</i>estimate, of &sigma; when computing confidences under
this model.)   In 5 example US senate races,
these confidence levels range between 99.3% and 99.99999999999999999999% depending 
which state &amp; election, and which error-estimation method is used for it.  
The net effect of all 3 kinds of tests seems to produce too much significance to be disputable.
</p>

<h3> Were some 2014 elections manipulated by pro-Republican forces? </h3>

<p>
The media trumpeted that these elections were a "wave" &ndash;
no, a "tsunami" &ndash; thrusting
the Republican party into majority control in the US Senate, plus
also enlarging the majority they already had in the US House.
</p><p>
But was this due to honestly counting pro-Republican voter sentiment in the electorate, or
to dishonest election manipulation? Or both?
My initial motivation for this study was my worries that this election might be manipulated, 
based on the following reasons:
</p><ol>
<li>
A vast nationwide effort was made pre-election by Republican controlled state legislatures to enact
"voter ID" laws that appeared to be specifically and blatantly devised to make it more difficult 
for voter groups that tended to be pro-Democrat to vote, relative to voter groups 
that tend to be more pro-Republican.
Wendy R. Weiser, director of the "Democracy program" at NYU Law School's 
"Brennan Center for Justice," released a 
<a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/how-much-difference-did-new-voting-restrictions-make-yesterdays-close-races">report</a>
about the election, dated 5 Nov. 2014,
whose summaries of data in four states 
(NC, KS, VA, FL) suggested that 
"in several key races
the margin of victory came very close to the likely margin of 
disenfranchisement."
</li><li>
In many cases these laws were so blatant they were overthrown by courts (e.g. in Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania).
But, e.g,
after the Arkansas voter-ID law was struck down unanimously by their state supreme court,
many voters <i>still</i>
were turned away from the polls by officials illegally demanding photo ID and 
falsely claiming the supreme court decision did not apply in that county.
That's according to this 
<a href="http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/11/04/votre-suppression-reports-from-all-over">report</a>
by  Max Brantley in the <i>Arkansas Times</i>, which noted in at least 
one case the official claimed
he'd been instructed to do so by (Republican) 
Arkansas Secretary of State Mark Martin, which if so meant
this was a centrally organized conspiracy. And in Texas, even though their voter-ID law
was overturned as unconstitutional, it still was employed during the
election because the US supreme court (pending deciding Texas's appeal) 
said it would be too disruptive to void the law
shortly before the election.
</li><li>
Investigative reporter Greg Palast
<a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/double-voters">exposed</a>
what appeared to be an enormous effort, in 27 US states, designed to stop
millions of voters from voting, but for no legitimate reason.  
The effort was "the pet project of Kansas' controversial Republican secretary of 
state, Kris Kobach."  (Kobach also was involved in other moves indicating his extreme bias...)
It is reminiscent of the infamous Florida 2000
&quot;<a href="PalastFlaFelons.html">felons</a>
<a href="PalastObs.html">list</a>&quot;
(later found to be over 90% non-felons &ndash; this list 
<a href="FraudHist.html#FLfelons">unquestionably</a> unjustifiably "threw"
the USA 2000 presidential election to Bush by at least about 20000 votes as opposed
to the official <a href="Flor2000Res.html">537</a>-vote margin) 
but on a far larger scale.
</li><li>
About 50000 voter registration forms in Georgia were "lost" or ignored (purposefully?)
by the Georgia Secretary of State's office and/or its county offices
&ndash; probably mostly Democrat-favoring voters since the "New Georgia Project"
organizing this
registration drive was claimed to have mostly registered black voters
(and blacks in 2014 tend to vote about 90% Democrat).
(<a href="GAregistScandal2014.html">Press clippings about this</a>.)
</li><li>
In Chicago Illinois,
<blockquote>
"more than 2000 election judges &ndash; a fifth of the total &ndash;
failed to show up at polling places after automated phone 'robo'calls beginning 
on Saturday falsely informed them that they were unqualified without additional training.
Officials from both the Democratic and Republican parties in the city denied 
involvement in the calls, which an election board official said appeared to target a
particular party that he declined to identify."
"This is a new dirty trick," said Chicago Election Board spokesman Jim Allen.
</blockquote>                                          
That was from the CBS news story

</li><li>
Statistical evidence:
Elections in several states, 
especially the already-suspect states Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois, and Georgia,
exhibited suspiciously large discrepancies between the official results
and the predictions of pollsters.  Examples will follow.
We'll also find other statistical anomalies.
</li></ol>
<p>
E.g. Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia,
said on "Fox and Friends" TV show Wednesday morning (5 Nov 2014).
"I want an investigation of the polls in Virginia. They were
completely wrong, just as they were in Georgia. They were also way off
in Illinois, and I could go on and on.  Boy, is that an industry that
needs some housecleaning."
</p><p>
But an equally possible interpretation to the view that many different pollsters, all
with different methodologies and funders, all got it wrong in the same direction is:
this proves there were a
lot of election-manipulation shenanigans happening!   Here is a quick look
at the examples Sabato pointed out, plus Kansas and Arkansas, which are even more discrepant:
</p><ol><li>
 While Republicans were widely expected to take control of the
Senate, few predicted that former RNC chair Ed Gillespie would come
close
to unseating Democratic incumbent Mark Warner in Virginia.
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/va/virginia_senate_gillespie_vs_warner-4255.html">RealClearPolitics</a>
had claimed Warner enjoyed nearly a 10-point lead
over Gillespie in an average of all recent polls (48.5 to 38.8), with
not a single poll showing Gillespie leading. Officially Warner won by
less than one percentage point  (49.2 to 48.4).
Indeed, it took until 7 November &ndash; 3 days after election day &ndash;
for Gillespie to concede the race, since he considered
it too close for that to be wise.
</li><li>
 In Georgia US senate race:
The final 
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ga/georgia_senate_perdue_vs_nunn-4040.html">RealClearPolitics</a>
many-poll average (polls 27oct-3Nov) was
Perdue(R)=47.8, Nunn(D)=44.8, Swafford(Lib)=3.6%.
Final official election result: Perdue=53.0, Nunn=45.1, Swafford=1.9%.
Perdue's count is suspiciously far above poll predictions.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also in Georgia, governor race: Republican Nathan Deal beat Democrat
Jason Carter by 8.0 points in an open US senate seat, 52.8 to 44.8
percent (Andrew Hunt [Lib] got 2.4%).
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/ga/georgia_governor_deal_vs_carter-3461.html">RealClearPolitics</a>' 
poll-average had Deal 48.0, Carter 43.4, Hunt 4.0,
only a 4.6-point margin.
</li><li>
In Illinois Governor race:
Official result:  Bruce Rauner(R) won with 50.8 versus Pat Quinn(D)
45.9 and Chad Grimm(L) 3.4, a margin 4.9. 
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/il/illinois_governor_rauner_vs_quinn-4224.html">RCP</a>
many-poll average (16
Oct-2 Nov): Rauner 44.0, Quinn 45.0, Grimm 3.7 for margin 1.0 the
other way.
</li><li>
In Kansas Senate race,
Official result:  Pat Roberts(R) won with 53.3 versus Greg
Orman(indep) 42.5, a margin 10.8 for Roberts.
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ks/kansas_senate_roberts_vs_orman-5216.html">RCP</a>
many-poll average (18 Oct-3 Nov): Roberts 42.6, Orman 43.4, margin
0.8 the other way!
</li><li>
 In Arkansas, also large discrepancies occurred in the 
<a href="assets/documents/ArkansasGov2014.txt">Governor</a>,
and especially <a href="assets/documents/ArkansasSenate2014.txt">Senate</a>,
races.
</li></ol>

<h3> How statistically significant are those discrepancies in some individual states? </h3>
<p>
Some of these results are <b>extremely unlikely</b> if the polls are taken at
face value.  Specifically, the following Senator races, among the examples above, appear to be
statistically significant (in approximately decreasing order):
Kansas,
Virginia,
Arkansas,
Georgia.
</p><p>
Let's look at
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ks/kansas_senate_roberts_vs_orman-5216.html#polls#polls"><b>Kansas</b></a>.
RealClearPolitics apparently based its average on
polls of  963+907+1137+623+757+1973+960=7320  likely voters.  The standard
error bar for such a super-poll should be &plusmn;0.58% for an individual candidate,
or twice that, namely 1.16% of
the number of voters, if we are reckoning the Orman-Roberts
vote-<i>difference</i>. The actual error in that difference was 11.6%. This
is 9.9 standard deviations (9.9&sigma;) off.
The chance that such a large discrepancy would occur via statistical
fluctuations alone,
if the polls really chose a random sample of voters, is below  <b>10<sup>-22</sup>.</b>
If you do not like this way of estimating the standard error &ndash; since it assumes
essentially ideal performance by the pollsters &ndash; a different method is to
assess it via inter-poll discrepancies.
Specifically, the 8 polls RCP used reported the following margins for Roberts
(as a voter-percentage; negative means Orman was ahead in that poll):
</p><center>
-1, -1, 1, 1.3, -2, -1, 4, -5
</center><p>
with unweighted mean=-0.4625
and sample standard deviation 2.65.
</p><p>
Notice at this point I do <i>not</i> divide 2.65 by &radic;8,
which would have yielded 0.94
as our estimate for the standard error of the 8-poll-average.  
I thus am intentionally <i>not</i> taking
advantage of the fact that the average of N random variables tends to have 
standard error &radic;N times smaller
than for each one alone.  
This is because I want this number to yield an <i>upper bound</i>
on the standard error.  I'm trying to
get what is probably an optimistic error estimate the first way, 
and what is very likely to be pessimistic the second way, to "play it safe."
(To oversimplify a bit, this non-division causes our estimate of the error
in an N-poll average to be reckoned, quite conservatively, as roughly the error
in the individual polls.)
And I'm playing it safer on the upper bound than the lower bound, because 
if we are going to err, I want that erring to be an <i>over</i>estimate of &sigma;.
</p><p>
So using &sigma;=2.65, we now are only 11.6/2.65=4.38 standard deviations off, 
so the <a href="NormTble.html">chance</a>
<i>that</i> could have happened by fluke is <b>0.000006.</b>
(Again: This second error-estimation method is very probably pessimistic while the 
first is probably optimistic.)
</p><p>
So I conclude that in Kansas either the pollsters were unable to
obtain a random voter sample, or the official election was
manipulated, or both.   Experienced pro pollsters generally are pretty good at
getting random voter samples, e.g. by "correcting" their actual sample
to make it agree with demographic data about, e.g. actual voters last
election (determined via exit polls).
</p><p>
In <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/va/virginia_senate_gillespie_vs_warner-4255.html"><b>Virginia</b></a>, if RCP based its average on polls with 
634+738+1605+444+690=4111 likely voters, then standard error (for estimating 
Gillespie-Warner vote-difference) &plusmn;1.56% of voters.
The polls gave these Warner margins:
</p><center>
7, 12, 10, 10, 12
</center><p>
with unweighted mean=10.2% and sample standard deviation 2.05%.
(I now again do <i>not</i> divide 2.05 by &radic;5 which would
have yielded the &sigma; estimate 0.917.)
Using &sigma;=1.56 and &sigma;=2.05, the same two estimation
methods then finds Warner's official margin 0.8% was either 5.71 or 4.34 standard deviations off
the RCP poll-average 9.7% predicted margin
<a href="NormTble.html">for</a>
probability levels of only <b>6&times;10<sup>-9</sup></b> or 
<b>0.000007</b>
respectively that
this was merely a statistical fluke.
</p><p>
In the <b><a href="assets/documents/ArkansasSenate2014.txt">Arkansas</a></b> senate race,
our two estimation methods yield 
probability levels <b>2&times;10<sup>-12</sup></b> and <b>0.007</b> respectively.
</p><p>
In the <b><a href="assets/documents/SDsenate2014.txt">South Dakota</a></b> senate race,
our two estimation methods yield 
probability levels <b>7&times;10<sup>-8</sup></b> and <b>0.00003</b> respectively.
</p><p>
In the <b><a href="assets/documents/IowaSenate2014.txt">Iowa</a></b> senate race,
our two estimation methods yield 
probability levels <b>0.00001</b> and <b>0.007</b> respectively.
</p><p>
In the <b><a href="assets/documents/KYsen2014.txt">Kentucky</a></b> senate race,
our two estimation methods yield 
probability levels <b>7&times;10<sup>-11</sup></b> and <b>0.002</b> respectively.
</p><p>
In the <b><a href="assets/documents/MAsen2014.txt">Massachusetts</a></b> senate race,
our two estimation methods yield 
probability levels <b>0.0005</b> and <b>0.093</b> respectively.
</p><p>
<b>A contrast:</b>
The Iranian election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009
was claimed by many USA pundits and government propagandists to be fraudulent.
This fueled protests in Iran.
But Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty, who work for a nonprofit group
called Terror Free Tomorrow: The Center for Public Opinion, in the 15
June 2009 Washington Post
<a href=" BallenDoherty.html">disputed</a> 
that, claiming this election was honest. This was based on their own
poll of 1001 Iranians conducted in June which had predicted Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's victory.
Their poll showed "Ahmadinejad leading by a more than 2 to 1 margin &ndash;
greater than his actual official victory (62.6 percent versus just
less than 34 percent for the main challenger, Mir Hussein Moussavi).
Further, another op-ed "Ahmadinejad won; get over it"
<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23745.html">appearing</a>
originally on
politico.com, then reprinted (19/06/2009) by Al-Jazeera, authored by
Flynt Leverett also claims that election was honest.  I personally found these defenders of
Iran 2009 to be more convincing than the attackers (who had little or no evidence).
But if you want a better idea, install a mathematically
better voting system in Iran,
e.g. <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> which is immune to vote-splitting.
Vote-splitting effects seem to have been a much larger problem than fraud (if any)
in this election.
</p><p>
My point: there was a lot less evidence for fraud in Iran 2009 than in
2014 USA since
we've got a lot more and better polling in the USA, and said polls
disagreed more violently with reality.
So unless you hear at least as much whining about the USA election as you heard about the Iran
election, you know those whiners are hypocrites.

<h3> Dividing the US states into two (or three?) subsets &ndash; initial attempt fails to find a signal </h3>
<p>
There were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014">36</a>
US <b>senate</b> races in November 2014 (including a few special elections).
The discrepancy between the official margin of victory and the pre-election poll average
(both with the sign Republican-NonRepublican)
ranged from a low of <b>&ndash;</b>6.0 for Massachusetts &ndash;
i.e. the Democrat Ed Markey
won by 6.0 percent of voters more margin than expected, i.e. by 62.0-38.0=24.0 
over Brian Herr(R) versus 53.0-35.0=18.0 margin in 
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ma/massachusetts_senate_herr_vs_markey-5151.html">RCP</a>'s pre-election poll 
average &ndash; to a high of +14.7 in
<a href="assets/documents/WYsen2014.txt">Wyoming</a>.
If we just focus on the 6 states 
WY AR TN VA SD IA
that Nate Silver claimed had
the greatest discrepancies (all 6.2 or above)
we find that 5 were Republican-controlled and 1 Democrat-controlled
(here defined as having a Republican Secretary of State,
the official generally in charge of elections),
namely Republican:
WY Max Maxfield, AR Mark Martin, TN Tre Hargett,
SD Jason Gant, IA Matt Schultz;
Democrat:
VA Levar Stoney.
<!--WARNING: need to check numbers??-->
Well, that was a mildly impressive, but certainly not a hugely impressive, finding.
</p><p>
There were <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gubernatorial_elections,_2014">35</a> 
state <b>governor</b> races in November 2014
with the official-poll discrepancies
ranging from a low of <b>&ndash;</b>2.5 for Alabama to a high of 21.5 for Nevada.
If we focus on the 6 states with the greatest discrepancies
NV TN SD MD VT OH
(all above 10.0 
<A href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-were-skewed-toward-democrats/">according</a> 
to Nate Silver &ndash; we later will focus
on RealClearPolitics.com numbers, not Silver since he is less transparent, 
but this whole section is a preliminary 
examination so let's not worry about that right now)
we find that 3 were Republican-controlled and 3 Democrat-controlled.
<!--WARNING: need to check numbers??-->
(Repub: TN Tre Hargett,
SD Jason Gant,
OH Jon A. Husted;
Dem: NV Ross Miller, 
MD John P. McDonough,
VT James C. Condos.)
Unimpressive.
</p><p>
OK, that hardly supports the "Republican conspiracy" theory. However, thinking
a bit more, if you wanted to bias things, you wouldn't
bother in the wide-margin easy-victory states.  That would be pointless.
You'd only do it in the close states.
<!--
Note that of the top 6 senate discrepancy states we listed, the <i>close</i>
ones (according to pre-election polls or official result, whichever closest) were 
AR, IA, VA.  --and perhaps SD, with 12.2 pre-election margin--
All three were Republican controlled.  No, not VA.
Of the top 6 governor discrepancy states we listed, the only close
ones were MD and VT, both Democrat-controlled.
Again, these findings are not terribly supporting the
"big Republican conspiracy" theory.  One could say they still are compatible with the
theory the conspiracy
only concentrated on the senate not governors.  
-->
So let's examine the "close races" hypothesis systematically.

where we again have starred (*) the Republican-controlled states.
Their discrepancies are
</p><center>
13.2 &gt; 5.9 = 5.9 &gt; 5.6 &gt; 4.5 &gt; 3.5 = 3.5 &gt; 3.4 &gt; 2.2 &gt; 1.7 &gt; 0.4 &gt; -0.2 &gt; -0.5 &gt; -0.8 &gt; -1.7 &gt; -1.8 &gt; -2.4
</center><p>
This again is fairly impressive.
If the discrepancy were totally unrelated to party-control
then the chance that, purely by luck, the 8 Dem-controlled states would have contained
all 5 of the bottom 5 in our list of 17, would be
<nobr>Binomial(8,5)&times;5!&times;12!/17!=2/221&asymp;0.00905.</nobr>
</p><p>
Put both these results (close Senate <i>and</i> close Governor) races together, and the
chance we would have seen effects at least this severe in both is 
<nobr>
(5/126)&times;(2/221)=5/13923&asymp;0.000359.
</nobr>
</p><p>
This makes it seem that the "big Republican conspiracy" theory 
(more precisely: the hypothesis that the Republican-favoring discrepancy 
between polls versus official results is <i>boosted</i> if a Republican holds
the Secretary of state position in that state) 
<i>is</i> supported by the close-race data, statistically significantly,
at <b>99.96%</b> confidence level.
</p><p>
Incidentally, note this ordering-based method 
(<b>"non-parametric robust statistics"</b> as they say in the biz)
of analysis is equally applicable
in "Republican tsunami" election
years or "Democrat tsunami" election years (or anything in between).
Parametric methods tend to yield more statistical significance than
nonparametric methods, but the price you pay for that is 
the parametric methods tend to depend heavily
on the validity of some assumed probability model, e.g. "normally distributed errors."
Meanwhile nonparametric tests are very "robust" i.e. remain valid
highly independently of any modeling assumptions.
Also, nonparametric methods often are simpler.
</p>
<a name="keycrit"></a>
<h3> Criticism (and response) re the above analysis &ndash; the "bias score" test </h3>
<p>
The way I just did it, this analysis could be <b>criticized</b> on the grounds
than my particular tests were somewhat arbitrarily selected.  For example, in the 
Governor races I arbitrarily chose to look at the <i>last 5</i> states in the
ordering.  Why 5?  Well, I could have chosen other values, but I picked this one 
since there the last 5 all were Dem-controlled states, hence 5
seemed likely to "prove the presence of evil." 
So a critic could argue that really my test-failure
was less significant than it seems.  
E.g. if I could have chosen 10 values, and
I picked the "worst," then arguably this test-failure 
is 10 times less statistically-significant than it seems.
</p><p>
That's a legitimate criticism.  We could counter that 5 was a pretty natural choice.
But a better reply, which totally avoids this kind of criticism, is to
redo those tests this time in a 
non-arbitrary manner. Define the
"bias score" of a binary word to be the sum of the positions of the 1-bits in the word, 
where for a 9-bit word the "positions" are 876543210.  The point is, the "Republican controlled
'starred' states tend to lie on the left side of the ordering" 
is equivalent to the 1-bits tending to lie toward the 
left side of a binary word.  Then:
</p><p>
<b>The 9 close US Senate races 2014:</b>
Among the 84 binary 9-bit words with 6 bits '1', the number
whose bias score is at least as great as 30
(which is the bias of 111101010), is 7.  As a fraction this is 7/84=1/12&asymp;0.083333.
</p><p>
<b>The 17 close State Governor races 2014:</b>
Among the 24310 binary 17-bit words with 9 bits '1', the number
whose bias score is at least as great as 91
(which is the bias of 01101111110100000), is 905.  
As a fraction this is 905/24310=181/4862&asymp;0.037227.
</p><p>
<b>Combination:</b>
The chance of <i>both</i> the close senate <i>and</i> close governor races 
exhibiting this much (or more) bias naturally therefore is 
<nobr>(1/12)&times;(181/4862)=181/58344&asymp;0.00310.</nobr>
</p><p>
<b>Conclusion (after criticism addressed):</b>
The "big Republican conspiracy" theory                     
(more precisely: the hypothesis that the Republican-favoring discrepancy 
between polls versus official results is <i>boosted</i> when a Republican holds 
the Secretary of state position in that state &ndash; this phenomenon 
could equally well be branded
the "big Democratic conspiracy" if all we look at is the ordering data) 
<i>is</i> supported by the close-race data, statistically significantly
based on that ordering data, but now only at the <b>99.7% confidence</b> level.
</p><p>
That was solely based on considering ordering, 
ignoring the actual sizes of the discrepancies (aside from their ordering).
If we now <i>also</i> throw in the huge sizes of some of the discrepancies in certain individual
states, then this confidence will rise further, to levels which seem indisputable &ndash;
as well as now placing most of the blame for this on the <i>Republicans</i>.
For example, 
if we use the more-conservative of our two p-level estimates for each of the Senate
races in KS, VA, AR, SD, IA, 
then their combined p-level becomes
</p><center>
0.000006&times;0.000007&times;0.007&times;0.00003&times;0.007&times;36<sup>5</sup>&times;100
=
<b>4&times;10<sup>-10</sup></b>
</center><p>
where I have included a safety factor of 36<sup>5</sup> to compensate for the
same sort of valid criticism as before
(i.e. if I always pick the "worst" among 36 states, then that state's discrepancy has
36&times; less significance than some naive estimation) 
and an additional extra-safety factor of 100 to compensate
for possible numerical roundoff errors,
claims I'm a nasty fellow,
the fact skeptics might come up with some further criticisms in future, etc.
(Actually we could easily drive these p-values to even more microscopic levels by also
including some large governor-race discrepancies, etc.)
</p><p>
Incidentally, note that Senator &amp; Governor races (the only kind considered on this
page) all are <i>unaffected</i> by gerrymandering.   Gerrymandering is also a very bad
problem in the USA, but inadequate as an election manipulation tool since it cannot
be used for Senators, Governors, and the President.  Hence they had to invent other
manipulation methods too.
</P>
<h3> Conclusion &ndash; "Mission Accomplished" &ndash; this election was manipulated </h3>
<p>
If both the ordering analysis and those 5 large-discrepancies are put together, 
then even with my extra-safety factor 100 we still are getting confidence levels of
99.9999999999% that this election was manipulated to favor the Republican side
over and above the presumably-fair results reflected by multiple polls.   
If you want to take the ultra-conservative attitude that all polls are utterly random garbage
and the sizes of poll-official discrepancies by themselves mean absolutely nothing, 
then, the joy of our ordering-based analysis method is that we then  <i>still</i> 
get 99.7% confidence!
</p><p>
I think an important lesson to
learn is that the USA needs <i>unbiased</i> people and systems to
run and count its elections &ndash; not to mention drawing
its districts.  In many cases, the 
<i>most biased person in the entire state</i>
is intentionally selected to be its "Secretary of State"
in charge of all elections in that state,
with hire &amp; fire power over all its employees, and
including often supervising their <i>own</i> election.
For example, Kansas's notorious SoS 
Kris W. Kobach just supervised his own re-election, winning by a 59.4:40.5
margin (18.9 points) over Jean K. Schodorf despite
a 6-poll-average computed by 
<a href="http://insightkansas.wordpress.com/kansas-secretary-of-state-polling-averages/">Insight 
Kansas</a> from 30 september thru 27 october showing
Kobach with a 3.8 percentage point average lead;
the 6 individual poll leads ranged from 0 to +8.
Also Kobach won despite virtually most observers agreeing he clearly is highly biased.
(Such as unanimous court decision overruling his weird 
<a href="assets/documents/KansasSenate2014.txt">attempt</a>
to force Taylor to run...)
Actually this lesson should have been obvious from the beginning.  
The USA is the laughingstock of
world democracies in this sense.  But we now have clear statistical evidence
that SoS's <i>do</i> abuse their power to put their thumbs on the scales.
</p>
<h3> Another statistical test for <i>general</i> (not just Republican) chicanery </h3>
<p>
<b>Different stars *:</b>
In these section, we shall star a state, not if (as before) 
it is "Republican controlled" but rather, if
its <b>election audit</b> procedures are  "Inadequate"
according to this color-coded US map
</p><img src="assets/images/Post-Election-Audits-8002.jpg" alt="US map showing post-election audit quality"/>
<p>
independently produced by the independent voting-reform group 
<a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/post-election-audits/">VerifiedVoting.org</a>
in 2009, i.e. well before this Nov. 2014 election.
("Inadequate" usually means no, not even a pretense, 
of audits, which is unfortunately the case for 25 of
the 50 US states, if I counted right on that map.)  
</p><p>
<b>Different ordering:</b>
We also shall order the states differently.
For the 9 close Senate states, instead of ordering them by
by decreasing <i>Republican-favoring</i>
official-poll margin discrepancy, we'll just order by decreasing <i>absolute value</i> of
the official-poll margin |discrepancy|.
</p><p>
<b>The idea we now are trying to test:</b> 
The larger the |discrepancy|, the more likely it was caused by evil election manipulation, and for
this test we shall not care which side is doing the manipulating in that state.  We just want
to test the hypothesis that states with poor auditing procedures, are more manipulated.
Or, if you want to put a happier(?) face on it, "more prone to severe errors."
</p><p>
The resulting re-starred re-ordering of the 9 close <b>senate</b> races is:

all taken directly from RealClearPolitics.com figures hyperlinked to each state.
<b>WOW!</b>  This is the uniquely worst scenario.  The probability this would have happened

is 4!&times;5!/9!=1/126, because among the 9! possible orderings of these 9 states, only

</center><p>
Among the 24310 binary 17-bit words with 8 bits '1', the number
whose bias score is at least as great as 77
(which is the bias of 11100&frac12;&frac12;1001&frac12;&frac12;0101), is 2867.  
As a fraction this is 2867/24310&asymp;0.117935.
</p><p>
<b>Combined</b>, this tells us that <i>yes</i> &ndash; laxer 
election auditing procedures, as reckoned by 
<a href="http://www.VerifiedVoting.org/">VerifiedVoting.org</a>,
<i>do</i> correspond, statistically significantly, to greater chicanery
as measured by official-poll |discrepancies|.
The p-level for this conclusion is
<nobr>(2867/24310)&times;(1/126)=2867/3063060&asymp;0.000936,</nobr>
in other words we have confidence <b>99.91%.</b>

In a new academic paper, Dr. James E. Campbell, Chairman of the Political Science Department at the State University of New York- Buffalo has analyzed The Cook Political Report's pre-Labor Day House ratings going back to the Report's founding in 1984. In 11 of the 13 elections in which the Cook Political Report published new ratings between July 1 and then end of August (all except 1986 and 1990), 99.8 percent of the 3,387 races rated by the Cook Political Report as Solid Republican or Solid Democratic in July or August of an election year went by way of that party, 94.9 percent of the 641 races rated as Likely Democratic or Likely Republican fell the way the Cook Political Report predicted, and 85.7 percent of the 441 races rated Lean Democratic or Lean Republican broke in favor of the leaning party. Of the 130 Democratic-held seats rated as Toss Up, 49.2 percent went for Democrats, and 55.0 percent of the 160 Republican held seats rated as Toss Up were won by the GOP.

<h3> WARNING (9 Nov 2014) </h3>
<p>
Mike Stay found a criticism which worries me.  I have to think on it.
(Also there is a second more minor unrelated
issue which may require me to multiply some of my p-levels by
a factor of about 2, which will not matter terribly much.)
The criticism is based on
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bad-pollsters-copying-good-pollsters">this disturbing essay</a>
by H.Enten.
It claims that "nontraditional pollsters" 
(i.e. who use techniques other than actual human-human interviews with random pollee
selection via, e.g. phones &ndash;
for example, internet and robotic techniques are a lot cheaper, but worse, techniques that
unfortunately are being employed more and more)
<ol type="A"><li>
 have a lot larger errors, roughly twice as large
</li><li>
 but when polling the same topic as traditional pollsters, who also are polling at about same time, 
their error rates improve to nearly equal the traditionalists
</li><li>
 ...which presumably means they are <i>cheating</i> by copying off the good pollsters.
Bastards.
</li></ol><p>
This casts a tremendous amount of stuff into doubt.  Including maybe my own
study right here (yikes!); I'd better consider that.
Hopefully: (1) the fact I've here concentrated on <i>close</i> races
means there was enough polling interest that the good pollsters participated almost all the time,
plus (2) hopefully I'd incorporated enough safety margins into the analysis all this will hardly matter,
and (3) the nonparametric analyses presumably are hardly affected, if at all.
But anyhow, all this needs some thought, and the present study is now under a cloud as far as I am concerned
and will remain so until I address this.
</p><p>
Incidentally, Enten's essay would have been more convincing had he looked
at nontrad pollsters in same elections as trad, but coming after, or coming before
(enabling cheating, or not).  And if he had actually 
used their poll sizes, and claimed error bars, as opposed to just ignoring that data.

The Polls Were Skewed Toward Democrats</a> by Nate Silver 5 Nov. 2014. 
(Contains some erroneous data, which Silver correctly warned was "preliminary.") 
Quote:
"In the past, Republicans have tended to outperform their polls in red states while Democrats have done so in blue states",
a claim Silver supported with 
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-the-state-polls-skewed/">this</a> previous analysis by him.
His quote agrees with my results here; and again, if true, is damning. 
[For readers not joined at the hip with the USA media hype machine:
"Red"=Republican-controlled 
and "blue"=Democrat-controlled in Silver's jargon.
It of course makes no sense historically that the more conservative party should be assigned the color "red" (!),
but for some unknown reason Silver and many media pundits have adopted that convention.]
Incidentally, note Silver's title "The <i>polls</i> were skewed" seems on the surface to disagree 180&deg; with my view
the <i>elections</i> were manipulated, even though the actual content of Silver's piece seems to agree with my views!
Silver's piece simply takes it as an article of faith the problem lay with the polls, not the elections, and devotes not
one scintilla of effort, 
not even a single sentence, to examining the question of which.  However, had
Silver been working with election-verification groups of the sort which often use polls as a tool to help
decide whether some country is conducting fraudulent elections, presumably his attitude would differ from that.
Since otherwise, they'd fire him.
