In this 19-voter example (containing, for those who care,  a 
&quot;<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>&quot;)
the <b>winner is B</b>
under a vast variety of election methods that employ rank-orderings as votes.
(<font size="-1">Namely, all these methods declare B the winner:
Plurality, Borda=Dabagh, Plurality with 
Instant Runoff, Black, Schulze-Beatpath, 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV=Instant Runoff Voting</a>, 
Loring,
<a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>, 
<!-- Coombs is true, but the betray does not make A win with Coombs -->
River, Maxtree,
<a href="RankedPairs.html">Tideman Ranked Pairs</a>, Improved-Dodgson,
Simpson-Kramer, Nanson, Rouse, Raynaud, Arrow-Raynaud,
Condorcet Least Reversal, Woodall DAC,
Sarvo-Plurality,   
Sinkhorn,
and Keener-eigenvector.</font>)
</p>

<p>
But if the six
C>A>B voters <a href="AlteredExagg.html">insincerely switch</a>
to A>C>B ("<i><a href="FBCsurvey.html"><b>betraying their favorite</b></a></i>" C)
then the "lesser evil" <b>A</b> becomes
the winner under all these voting systems (and is the Condorcet-winner),
which in their view is a <i>better</i> election result.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lying paid.</i>
</p>

<p>
This favorite-betrayal example is very important because, once voters understand that
exaggerating their stances on the apparent-frontrunners can be necessary to
prevent the "greater evil"
frontrunner from winning, strategic voting is guaranteed, often causing
"third parties" to tend to die out (since the strategic voters will
not "waste their vote" on honest-favorite third-party candidates like C whom they perceive as
having "no chance of winning").  
</p>

<p>
In all of the voting systems we just mentioned, therefore,
one might expect, or at least worry, that artificially enhanced
<a href=Duverger.html>self-reinforcing 2-party domination</a>
is still going to occur.
Note that "<a href=rangeVcond.html>Condorcet methods</a>" are vulnerable to this problem:
of the methods just mentioned, Black, Schulze-Beatpath, Loring, Nanson,
Rouse, Raynaud, BTR-IRV, River, Maxtree,
Tideman Ranked Pairs, and Condorcet Least Reversal all are Condorcet methods.
Condorcet advocates might hope to escape from that trap by instead employing
variant-Condorcet methods that permit "ranking equalities" and that are based on
&quot;<a href="WinningVotes.html">winning votes<a>&quot; rather than "margins."  
That initially sounded
like a possible way out, but it <a href="VenzkeFBC3.html">isn't.</a>
Indeed, <a href="VenzkePf.html">Kevin Venzke showed</a> that <i>every</i> Condorcet method
(whether ranking equalities are allowed or not) suffers "favorite betrayal,"
completely wiping out all such hopes of wriggling out of this trap.
</p>

<p>
Note also that 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>
(IRV) also is vulnerable to this problem and in fact experimentally
IRV does lead to 2-party domination.
For this reason "third parties" are <i>silly</i> to advocate IRV.
(Click <a href="Why2Part.html">here</a> for more re this silliness.  See also this
<a href="TarrIrv.html">other more realistic IRV example</a>.)
</p>

<P>This example perhaps may seem contrived and you might think it only occurs rarely.
Not so.  
This kind of insincere-exaggerating
voter-strategy
is optimal asymptotically 100% of the time in a mathematical model of a "large random electorate"
with <i>any</i> Condorcet voting system using full rank-orderings as votes.
And ditto for IRV voting. <a href="IRVStratPf.html">Proof.</a> 
</P>

<p>
Range voting, however, is <i>immune to this problem</i>
in the sense that in any 3-candidate election, it is <i>never</i>
strategically desirable for any voter to range-vote as though X>Y when his
true opinion is Y>X.  So in the situation illustrated, the six C>A>B voters 
would <i>not</i> find it strategically desirable to cast a range vote 
in which A>C>B.  And the word "never" above makes us believe that with range voting,
2-party domination is <i>not</i> inevitable.
