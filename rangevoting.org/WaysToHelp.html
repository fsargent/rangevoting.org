            Recruit new members. To make this work, we want a lot (a thousand?) members.
            Especially ones willing to do things.
        </li>
        <li>
            Recruit endorsers, especially prominent ones,
            including: scientists and scholars especially in voting-related areas;
            respected party leaders such as Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton,
            Robert Dole, Andrew Young, James Baker, Ralph Nader, Howard Phillips;
            Politicians; Church Leaders; Nobelists, etc.
            We are seeking endorsements from every important US political party &ndash; unified across
            all party boundaries.
            Now of course, we are looking to be endorsed by people of national stature. However,
            those high-stature endorsers tend to get more interested if there are already
            endorsements from lower-stature people of their same kind, or their friends.
            And so on down the chain. So do not feel that only endorsements from the tippy
            top experts and leaders matter. All matter.
            See our <a href="ComboEndorse2.html">Endorsements page</a> for how to proceed.

        <li>
            Generate "buzz," educate the public, and inspire new members to appear, by
            writing <a href="assets/data/letstoed.latex">letters</a> about range voting to editors of magazines.
            (Many magazines are listed <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/links">here</a>.)
            Your letter should
            mention the URL of our main web page, which is currently
            <a href=""></a>,
            so that people reading it can follow up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit
            <a href="ClassAds.html">classified ads</a>
            to suitable publications.
            This might work better than letters to editors, but costs money.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do research for us.
            Examples:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    To make the <a href="IowaExecSumm.html">Iowa 2008 caucus plan</a> (of changing
                    their rules to make them use Range Voting) work we need
                    to know exactly who in the Democratic &amp; Republican party hierarchies needs
                    to change exactly what party rules, whose support we need,
                    and we want to know just what those rules say
                    and what we need to change them to.
                    We need their contact info, identities, and we need to know which Iowa party rules
                    exactly need to change and who exactly needs ot change them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make ballot initiatives happen, we need to understand exactly what procedures we
                    need to go through in each ballot-initiative state of interest.
                    Our <a href="BallInit.html">sample ballot initiative to reform voting</a> &ndash;
                    is this language going to be legally an OK ballot initiative &ndash; in which states,
                    and in which states will it encounter legal roadblocks and how to overcome them?
                </li>
                <li>
                    We want to be a 501(c)3 nonprofit if possible. But is it possible?
                    Yes: educational organization. No: lobbying is main purpose.
                    But the IRS says lobbying is ok if not main purpose, and the key question is
                    "does asking the D & R parties to change internal rules &ndash; not laws, not
                    ballot initiatives or referenda, but internal party rules &ndash; count as "lobbying"
                    under IRS definitions?"
                    If we had a good case the answer is "no" then that would help us a lot.
                    Later note: we believe we've figured out the 501(c)3-related questions now.
                    But we could use help actually <i>doing</i> the incorporation now. Want to be a Board Member?
                    Post to our <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">bulletin board</a> saying so.
