Although we generally hear in Civics Class
about how <i>Athens</i> was the birthplace of democracy...
it 
<a href="BPSparta.html">turns out</a>
that the Ancient <b><a href="SpartaBury.html">Spartans</a></b>
used score voting to make important collective decisions...
sort of.  The Spartans employed these
democratic methods both before Athenian democracy started
(and also before the  Northwest Indian Buddhist period democracies in 600 BC to 200 AD)
and after it ended, and thus appear to be
both the <i>earliest</i> and the <i>longest lasting</i>
substantially-democratic government in world history.

Note this is over 
500 years of Range voting experience for both Venice and Sparta (each)
 &ndash;
each more consecutive years of experience than any other election method has had.
Venice and Sparta were apparently the two longest-lasting governments
incorporating some democratic elements ever.
(Compare: Roman republic lasted only about 460 years before
the Roman Emperors took over. Athens democracy
only lasted about 200 years. USA so far: only about 220 years.
The English might qualify as champions <i>if</i> you date their "democracy" to the Magna
Charta in 1215, but I would not consider them as comparably democratic to Venice 
until the 1700s.

<i>Carthage's</i> government involved both democratic and checks-and-balances principles
and 
would be a legitimate contender for the longetivity crown, since it lasted from Carthage's founding
in 814 BC(?) until its utter destruction in 146 BC by the Romans, <i>except</i> that
Carthage apparently only became substantively democratic during the 400-300 BC century.
Because
the city and all government and other records were destroyed, we know little about it.
For example, what sort of voting system(s) did the Carthaginians use? 
That seems unknown (based on reading several books about Carthage).

<dd>
<a href="Approval.html">Approval Voting</a> was used for
selecting 41 <b><a href="ListOfPopes.html">Popes</a></b>, 
in a system instituted by Pope (and saint)
Celestine V, who then became one of the few Popes (perhaps the only one)
ever to resign before Benedict XVI (2005-2013) who 
resigned a few years after I wrote this just to screw up this web page.
While the papacy can hardly be considered a democracy, it
has been probably the longest-lasting human institution on the face
of the earth, and during these years it was an extremely powerful position.
These <a href="PopeSummary.html">conclusions</a> summarize
my attempt to study all the approval-voting popes.
<br>
<small>
Poundstone in <i>Gaming the Vote</i> speculates this Pope-system
was probably inspired by the Venetian system
and cites a paper by
J.M. Colomer &amp; Iain McLean: <a href="ColomerMpopes.pdf">
Electing popes, approval balloting and qualified-majority rule (pdf)</a>,
J.Interdisciplinary History 29,1 (1998) 1-22; reprinted in 
<i>Politics and Political Change</i> (MIT Press 2001, R.I.Rotberg ed.) 47-68.
They in turn cite the "Ordinarium Sanctae Romanae Eclesiae" by Cardinal Jacobi Gaytani.
Typical elections had about
40 voters and 20 candidates.  Secret-ballot approval voting <i>but with a 2/3
supermajority requirement</i> was employed, with re-voting as many times as necessary (while
also introducing new candidates into the race as necessary) until
the winner exceeded that threshold.  This could take a very long time &ndash;
Celestine V's election in 1294 famously took 2 <i>years</i> starting in 1292, which
presumably inspired his reforms of the election system  &ndash;
and while that was improved by the use of approval rather than vote-for-one plurality voting,
the duration still seems to have been a big reason the old system was abandoned in 1622.  
(Electoral speed 
was encouraged by such rules as these: if it took longer than 3 days, the cardinals
were restricted to 2 simple meals per day; if it took longer than 8, their diet was
reduced to bread and water only; and the conclave was usually held in austere quarters with
armed guards.  
One of the new
rules after the approval-based system was abandoned
was that the kings of France and Spain &ndash; and later Austria &ndash; were granted 
veto power over the election of
any pope they found displeasing, albeit they only got to exercise one veto per election.
That rule operated until about 1910.)
Another problem was that during
repeated re-votes the totals for different candidates could and sometimes did change by
a lot as new information arose and/or as the strategic environment changed.  
(For example, one Pope initially got zero approvals; and at least three times,
pope-candidates who got over 50% approval failed to win &ndash; since of course
the ultimate winner got still more approval.)

The <b>Quakers</b> (aka "Religious Society of Friends"), a religious group 
noted for their adherence to "Christian Pacifism" 
form in England and Wales.  They later spread to many other parts of the world,
especially Pennsylvania (which is named after William Penn, a prominent Quaker), Kenya,
and Costa Rica.
They played an important historical role in the USA's abolition of slavery and also in
prison reform.  They also had the notion of equal rights for women far earlier than most
religions.  In 1947 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the
Friends Service Council and American Friends Service Committee, two Quaker organizations.
US President Richard Nixon claimed to be a Quaker, although many of his actions did not
seem to conform well to Quaker principles (such when he ordered
the 1972 Christmas bombing of Hanoi).
Herbert Hoover was another Quaker US President.
Other famous Quakers include 
Benjamin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_franklin">Franklin</a> and 
Joseph <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister">Lister</a>.
</p><p>
Anyhow, the Quakers at some point &ndash; I do not know when or where &ndash;
adopted the "Quaker poll" as a method of collective 
decision making.  In it, each person rates each option on a simple 3-point scale:
</p>
<ol><li>
 Cannot live with or tolerate
</li><li>
 Can live with or accept
</li><li>
 Prefer or greatly favor
</li></ol>
<p>
The phrasing of the choices can vary, but the basic point is that everyone rates every option as
a strong positive or negative, or a neutral (abstentions may be allowed). A simple chart can 
then be made, showing the number of times each option was given each rating. Often the chart is
made on a display during the actual voting, though a Quaker poll can as easily be taken by 
closed balloting, a show of hands, or other methods.   If the option were then selected with 
the greatest summed total, that would be exactly <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>
on a 3-point scale.  <small>We thank "Sderose" for this contribution.</small>

The 1900 <b>Olympics</b> (Paris)
and 1904 (St. Louis) both used score voting by a jury to
choose gymnastics winners.
<br>
<small>
Apparently the scores at that time were integers;
the use of decimals and the 0-10 scale had apparently not yet been
introduced. E.g. in 1900 Paris, the "Pointage"
for the "APPAREILS ET SERIES"
was an integer in the range [0,20]
with 6,7,8="mediocre",
15,16,17="tres bien" and 20="parfait"; the gymnast with the
highest point-total won.
In St. Louis the point system differed
from the Paris system.
(Some other gymnastics sub-competitions were objectively judged,
such as "rope climbing" where it was about time and distance.
But they don't do that one anymore.)
I do not know how the original 1896 (Athens) Olympics handled
the gymnastics competition.  The Ancient Greek Olympics (held 794 BC to 394 AD)
had no subjectively-judged events.  It also excluded
female athletes, although there were some female horse-breeder/owner
entrants in the chariot races, such
as Cynisca (or Cynistra?) of Sparta (who won in 396 and 392 BC)
and there was a separate women's Olympics
(the "Heraea Games") held less-frequently at the same site.
