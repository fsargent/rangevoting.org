<H2> Endorsement of Range Voting (at least for experimental use) by Nathan Larson (October 2006) </H2>

<p>
As founder of <i>Virginians for Instant Runoff Voting</i>, I support the
experimental use of 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voting and <a href="RRV.html">reweighted range voting</a> in
elections. Most of the U.S. electoral reform movement has rallied
behind instant runoff voting for single-seat races and proportional
representation by single transferable vote for multi-seat contests.
While these two systems have a longer history of use, alternative
systems &ndash; such as approval voting, Condorcet, and range voting &ndash; have
not been adequately tested to determine whether they would perform
better or worse than STV in the real world.
</p>
<p>
Further, the splintering of electoral reform advocates into camps
supporting rival voting systems has harmed all of our efforts. While
each system is bound to have its own pros and cons, additional
experiments with the lesser-used voting systems could help test the
claims of their proponents and opponents. A clearer picture of how
well these systems work in the real world could help eliminate less
workable systems from consideration, allowing a greater consensus to
emerge among reformers as to which system we should back.
</p>
<p>
Opponents of any electoral system can devise hypothetical scenarios
and voter behaviors that would cause it to produce undesirable
results. Practical experience with each system will be the surest way
to test the relevance and validity of these arguments.
