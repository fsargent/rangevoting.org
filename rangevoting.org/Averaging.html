<H2> Averaging versus Totaling </H2>

<p>
Averaging and totaling
are exactly <i>equivalent</i> things <i>if</i> no voter ever leaves a score 
blank
(or if blanks are disallowed).
</p>

<p>
They only differ if some voters intentionally leave some 
scores <i><a href="Blanks.html">blank</a></i> (by filling in that slot with an X)
because of their intent not to express an opinion about that candidate.
Then with totaling, blanks would be equivalent to a zero-vote,
whereas with averaging, blanks are ignored.
</p>

<H3> Unique properties of Averaging </H3>

Only averaging has the property that all voters "have equal influence"
on the final score.  I.e. if one voter (among N) perturbs vote by x then
the average score moves by x/N in the same direction.
This is a unique property of the "averaging" function.  No other has it.

For example with the "median" (or 75%tile) function, perturbing
your vote by x has zero effect except that one voter
can have x effect, i.e. maximally unequal effects.

<H3> Could averaging with blanks-for-"no opinion" lead to some 
unknown candidate getting elected with just one vote?! Yikes!
</H3>

<p>
<b>Claim:</b>
Averaging the scores of all those who expressed an
opinion, leaving out blanks, is a bad idea, since it could elect an unknown based
on a single vote!
</p>

<p>
<b>Response:</b>
Yes, true in theory... (if we eliminate the "<a href="RuleD.html">safety valve rule</a>"
and its current <a href="BetterQuorum.html">better version</a>)...
<i>but</i> you have to stop worrying about super-unlikely worst case scenarios 
and focus on cases that will happen.
</p>

<p>
The actual experimental fact is, lots and lots of voters experimentally are seen to fill in
a "no opinion/ignorant" slot with <i>zeros</i>. Not all of them. But about 1.7 times
more than prefer to leave them blank. (According 
to our data #82 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>.) 
My inquisitor evidently feels the same way.
(<font size="-1">In fact it is quite astounding how those who furiously argue against the X-blank
option assert that [1] they and their side &ndash; demanding that blanks be regarded as <i>zero</i> &ndash;
are vastly in the majority in this argument, <i>but</i> [2] none of that vast majority is
actually going to show up at the polls to actually vote 0, which is the whole reason we are
going to get a catastrophe.</font>)
These "give 'em zeros to play it safe"
voters will have a huge effect and will prevent the "single vote
from causing a win" nightmare scenario. In fact they will prevent the
"any small percentage of votes causing a win" scenario.
It simply is a bullshit scenario that
will not happen.
</p>

<a name="unlikely">
<p>
<i>Can</i> it happen? Yes, but it is unlikely. You do not seem to appreciate
just how unlikely. So let's do a calculation. 
Let us suppose it is a 100-voter
election.
Let us suppose that the stealth candidate has 10 secret supporters
pledged to give him 99s as part of his Evil World Takeover Plan.
Suppose he needs above 49 average to get elected. 
Now suppose
the rest of the voters (who are totally ignorant of that candidate) flip a coin.
If "tails" they leave the slot blank to express their ignorance. 
If "heads" they fill it in with 0 to play it safe.
This approximates the true situation, except I am being
very generous to my inquisitor by using a fair coin. In fact, the data says the
coin is biased about 10:17 in favor of heads. Maybe more. Ok, what are the
chances the stealth candidate will be elected? 
Same chances the 90 coin flips
come up heads only 10 times or fewer. I compute this chance to be
5.3&times;10<sup>-15</sup>.
Suppose we held one such election every day from the beginning of
the universe until now. The number of times the stealth candidate would have
been elected, from then to now, would have been in expectation
0.025, i.e. you'd have to wait 40 universe-lifetimes for it to happen.
</p>

<p>
Or put another way, of all the elections (including counting informal votes at meetings
and family gatherings) ever held in all human history, the total number
that would elect the stealth candidate (at this rate) would be below 1.
</p>

<p>
Now I was very generous to my inquisitor in the above calculation.
In reality any such stealth candidate could <i>not</i> mobilize 10% of society while
at the same time keeping everybody else totally ignorant about him!
One or the other, ok.  But not both.
And further, suppose we are not talking about a 100-voter election.
We are more realistically talking about 1000, or 10000, or more, voters.
Then the unlikeliness
gets <i>really</i> incredibly huge. I mean 0.000000...0001 with
pages and pages of zeros before you reach the 1.  That is how unlikely.
Beyond tiny.   Even if an election were held every nanosecond on every
atom in the universe for the whole age of the universe, the total
number of stealth victories then
would still be incredibly near zilch.
</p>

<p>
So can we return to the world of reality? 
<a href="AirMolec.html">Election system design should not
be based upon ludicrously unlikely stuff.</a>
It should be based on
likely phenomena. What is likely, is that honest voters and whatever
they want to say, is good to get in as undistorted a form as possible.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia can be good. But overmuch paranoia, is counterproductive.
