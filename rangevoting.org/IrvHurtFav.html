<H2> IRV example where voting for somebody makes him lose </H2>


<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 9 </td>
<td align="center"> A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 6 </td>
<td align="center"> B>A>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 5 </td>
<td align="center"> C>B>A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In IRV, C has the least votes and hence
is eliminated, and her votes transfer to B, so <b>B wins</b> over A. 
However, if two A>B>C voters had voted C>B>A (maximally dishonestly &ndash; 
completely reversing their
preference order to lie as much as they could possibly lie),
then:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 7 </td>
<td align="center"> A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 6 </td>
<td align="center"> B>A>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 7 </td>
<td align="center"> C>B>A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
B has the least votes and is eliminated, giving her votes to A, and <b>A wins</b>. 
So voting <i>against</i> your 
preferred candidate here <i>increases</i> his chance of winning!

This example was posted on the net by somebody named "The Phantom."
I liked it so I reposted it here.
