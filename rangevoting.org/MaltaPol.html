<H2> Politics of Malta </H2>

<p>
According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Malta">Wikipedia</a>:
</p>

<p>
``Two parties dominate Malta's polarized and evenly divided politics: the Nationalist Party tit
Nazzjonalista rence Gonzi, and the Malta Labour Party  invariably generate a 
widespread voter 
turnout exceeding 96%. The margin between the two parties is so narrow that a 52% share of 
the votes 
can  still be considered a "landslide" for the winning party.''
</p>

<p>
Evidently, IRV leads to 2-party domination, and in Malta's case a highly severe type,
even though Malta contains many multimember districts with STV PR elections.
[Later note: Malta as of 2006 apparently no longer uses IRV in the sense that every district is
now a 5-member district.]
