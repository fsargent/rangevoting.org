<b>B wins</b> this IRV election.  (F, G, and N are eliminated, in that order.)
</p>

<p>
Illogical but true facts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
This is despite the fact that G would win direct
pairwise elections versus every opponent, e.g. G would beat B by 14 to 7.
</li>
<li>
If the 3 voters in the last row had
ranked F first but <i>refused</i> to say more, i.e. refused to provide
their 2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th choices &ndash;
then G would have won (which those voters prefer over B).
This shows how IRV voters can be motivated to
<i>truncate</i>, i.e. refuse to rank-order some of the candidates, thus 
defeating IRV's goal
of gathering ordering information from the voters.
</li>
<li>
This same election but with no F thus also illustrates a "no show paradox":
the 3 voters in the last line would be better off
"not showing up" to cast their honest vote, since
that way they would get a better election winner!
</li>
<li>
That no-F scenario also shows how the voters in the last line would be motivated to
"betray" their true-favorite N (Nader) by dishonestly voting G>N>B to
rank G (Gore) top; then G would win, whereas their honest vote causes both G and N to lose.
This refutes the myth that IRV "cures" that problem with plurality voting.
</li>
<li>
And: if these 3 voters instead had dishonestly voted
B>F>N>G,  then G would have won (which they'd prefer to the old winner B)
despite the fact this just <i>raised</i> their opinion of B from last to
first place!
That is a severe
example of "non-monotonicity" and "raise-to-top failure."
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Meanwhile: <i>range voting</i> is monotonic, showing up to cast a range vote
can never hurt you,  "raise-to-top failure" never happens, "betraying" your favorite
by voting him sub-top is never strategically useful,
and range never seems to do anything especially illogical and
hard to justify.
