<H2> PR-STV can fail to elect landslide beats-all winners </H2>
<H3> Greatly outperformed by Reweighted Range Voting (<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>) in such cases </h3>

<p>
Let the candidates be
A,B,C,D,E,F and suppose
rank-order voting (Hare/Droop STV-PR system) is used to
elect the top 5. Assume there are 100 voters in all.
</P>
<table bgcolor="yellow" cellspacing="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>their rank-order vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>B>A>C>D>E>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>C>A>D>E>F>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>D>A>E>F>B>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>E>A>F>B>C>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>F>A>B>C>D>E</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A>B>C>D>E>F</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In this example, <b>A</b> is preferred versus every rival
(such as B) by a <b>huge 83-to-17 majority</b>, far larger than
the greatest landslide in US presidential election history.
So if it were a head-to-head A versus B race
(or A versus anybody else),
A would win huge.
</p><p>
<I>However</i>, the Hare/Droop PR-STV system used in, e.g. Ireland, Australia,
and for nominations for many OSCAR cinema awards,
will eliminate A in round 1.
In other words the 5 worst candidates B,C,D,E,F are the
5 winners
but not A who would seem fairly clearly to be the
best.   This is even though we are <i>trying</i> to make it <i>maximally</I> 
easy to win by having 5 winners out of 6 candidates &ndash; <i>still</i>
the hugely-favored A loses!
</p><p>
Why does this happen? Two ways to look at it:
</P>
<ol>
<li>
PR-STV ignores a lot of what a lot of the voters say.  For example, the fact 85 voters
ranked A second, is <i>ignored</i> by PR-STV.   It <i>solicits</i> full rankings from the voters, 
thus giving them the deceptive impression it cares what they say about non-top-ranked
candidates.  But in this election, it doesn't.  It never even looks at them.
</li><li>
The desire to elect a <i>good</i> winner can <i>conflict</i> with the desire for
<i>proportional representation.</i>  There are 5 "factions" here, each 
"well-represented" by B,C,D,E,F (the thinking goes).  PR-STV considers it
irrelevant whether everybody 
else besides their loyalists hates B,C,D,E, and F.
</li></ol>
</p><p>
This election also serves as a good example where <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>
(reweighted range voting) could behave significantly better than PR-STV.
RRV would almost-certainly elect A as the first winner, in this scenario.
I find it hard to believe that the virtues of "balancing the badness"
by fully-satisfying PR-STV's notions of "proportionality,"
here are worth the cost to society of eliminating the clearly-best candidate.
</p><p>
In the example at top, many of the details do not matter. For example
</p>
<table bgcolor="yellow" cellspacing="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>their rank-order vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>B>A>xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>C>A>xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>D>A>xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>E>A>xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>F>A>xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>A>xxx</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
where xxx means "it does not matter how the rest are ordered"
also works to demonstrate the same pathology.
</p>
<p>
We should also note that this pathology is not merely hypothetical.  It appears to have occurred
in various <a href="OscarPapers.html">OSCAR</a> votes in which superb movies, flagged by
the judgment of history as among the  best of all time, failed even to get <i>nominated</i>
for "best picture" that year!
