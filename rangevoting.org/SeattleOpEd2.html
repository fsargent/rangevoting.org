The right or wrong choice of voting methods may literally save or doom everything.
Seattle: lead democracy out of the 1700s
<!--be a role model--> 
with proposition <b>1A</b>.
</p><p>
Washington's current 
&quot;<a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/faqcandidates.aspx">top-2 primaries</a>&quot;
let you vote for anyone regardless of party; the top 2 enter the general.
Seattle's Nov.8 <!--2022--> ballot offers two 2-winner voting method options for future primaries:
(A) approval or 
(B) instant runoff voting. 
Even those choosing "name one candidate then shut up" (status quo) voting
can still select A versus B.
</p><p>
<b><a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> <a href="http://seattleapproves.org">Voting</a></b>'s
only change is allowing voters to 
"approve" any <i>set</i> of choices, <i>without</i> obligation to name only one.
The most-approved one (for Seattle, <i>two</i>) win.
Avoiding discarding "overvotes"
actually <i>simplifies</i> voting, plus inhibits fraud.
Approval vastly increases voter expressivity:
now cast any of 2046 approval-patterns, not just 11, with 11 candidates.
Voting is communicating desires,
so the old system forcing voters to provide the <i>least</i> information possible, is maximally stupid.
Approve-both to avoid two good candidates "splitting the vote," thereby enthroning a scoundrel.
You're no longer forced to lie-vote for your
"lesser evil" rather than true favorite, from fear
picking a "spoiler" would make both her and your second choice lose.
Surveys <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/Burden.pdf">showed</a> 
<!--B.Burden's table 1 p.4 shows 9% of Nader-top-ranking voters actually voted Nader, vs 52 Gore, 38 Bush, 1 Other.
And only 4% of Buchanan-top-ranking voters actually voted Buchanan, vs 42 Gore, 46 Bush, 4 Nader, 3 Other.
94% of Gore-top voters voted Gore. 94% of Bush-top voters voted Bush. And on p.3:
"Examining the pre-election rankings, Nader beats Buchanan (659-240), Gore (527-500), and Bush (562-491),
thus making him the Condorcet winner. Footnote:
The numbers in parentheses are the numbers of voters preferring Nader and each opponent in head to head rankings.
These data are weighted using the standard NES sample weight. Ties have been ignored."
-->
91% of voters with favorite Nader in 2000, lie-voted;
Nader actually majority-defeated Bush with honest votes!
90% dishonesty isn't democracy &ndash; nearer the opposite.
This "favorite betrayal" voter-behavior explains why only 0.02% of the last 80 years' Federal seats
were third party &ndash; <i>despite</i> <!--Jan-Feb-->
2021 Gallup <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/329639/support-third-political-party-high-point.aspx">poll</a>
findings 62% believe "the Republican and Democratic parties... do such a poor job that a
third party is needed." 
<!--leave rest of para out? will save 14 words at cost of less clarity about what that poll found:-->
(33%: "they do an adequate job of representing the American people," 5%: "don't know.")
</p><p>
Simpler.
Fewer voter errors.
Fewer ballots discarded.
Communicates more (and more honest) information about voter desires.
Ends vote-splitting and spoilers.
Better winners.
Less anti-third-party bias: more choices for you, 
goodbye intellectually sterile polarized-robot legislatures.
</p><p>
<b>Instant Runoff Voting</b> (option B) votes are <i>rank-orderings</i>.
IRV eliminates the candidate top-ranked least often, reducing a C-candidate election to <nobr>C-1,</nobr>
then again to <nobr>C-2</nobr>, continuing until only 2 <!--candidates--> remain: Seattle's two winners.
</p><p>
IRV's more complicated.  
More voter errors &amp; discarded ballots (7&times; more in <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/SPRates.html">San Francisco</a> 2004).
More ways to tie.
Still hugely anti-third-party: In 2006, third-parties held only 
<a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/AustralianPol.html">one</a> 
of Australia's 564 federal &amp; state IRV seats.
Unpopular: 
in all three nationwide <a href="WhatVotersWant.html">polls</a> (1974, 1984, and 2010) on this,
Australia wanted "abolish IRV" by 15%, 15%, and 20% margins.
Compare Latvia, with approval-elected parliament since 1995 
&ndash; no "abolish AV" polls there. (Ditto Greece 1864-1926.)
</p><p>
<!--If the point of IRV was to get rid of "spoilers" it failed.-->
Sorry suckers &ndash; IRV still has spoilers.
Sarah Palin
<a href="http://vixra.org/abs/2210.0103">was</a> it in Alaska's first statewide IRV election,
won in August by Mary Peltola:
The voters ranking "Palin&gt;Begich&gt;Peltola" made both Palin &amp; Begich lose;
but if they'd 
<!--demoted Palin to 2<sup>nd</sup> choice-->
un-voted Palin, they'd have elected their "lesser evil" Begich.
That election also <a href="http://vixra.org/abs/2210.0103">featured</a> 
IRV's horrific "non-monotonicity" paradox: 6000 Palin voters
changing their vote to Peltola would've made Peltola <i>lose</i>.
That's not a misprint &ndash;
IRV <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">often</a>
self-<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">contradicts</a>. 
Another:
IRV can elect as "best," the 
<a href="SeattleRevIRV.html">same</a> 
pair IRV considers "worst" (i.e. elects with <i>reversed</i> rank-orderings)!
</p><p>
Seattle's 2-winner IRV <i>differs</i> from Utah's "1+1" kind:
Utah elects winner#1, erases him from all rankings, then re-runs single-winner
IRV <!--on those altered ballots--> to elect winner#2.
That matters <a href="UtahSWM.html">because</a> in 13 such Utah bi-elections 2019-2022, 
the Seattle and Utah rules' second winners <i>disagreed</i> 8 times.
That "1+1&ne;2" contradiction proves something's wrong with either
2- or 1-winner IRV (or both) 8/13 <!--62%--> of the time.
</p><p>
Those self-contradictions never happen with Approval.  
With approval 1+1=2; the most-approved isn't the least-;
honestly approving favorites never hurts you; and switching your vote from X to Y never hurts Y.
</p><p>
IRV <a href="http://vixra.org/abs/2210.0103">artificially</a>
<a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/IrvExtreme.html">favors</a> extremists; approval 
<a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/Extremism.html">doesn't</a>.
</p><p>
<!--And why must IRV-proponents continually <i>deceive</i>? Consider-->
<!--this para is 66 words, can drop if do not care about fact SF ballot wording was lie and SF in hindsight want repeal:-->
San Francisco was the first modern US city to adopt IRV, 55-45% in a 2002 referendum.
Their 1-sentence referendum wording "Shall the City use Instant run-off voting to elect City officers <i>with a majority</i> of votes" <i>lied</i>:
SF then elected non-majority IRV-winners.
(Peltola also won <a href="http://vixra.org/abs/2210.0103">by</a>
non-majority, indeed more IRV voters ranked Begich above Peltola than below.)
2011-2012 <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/WhatVotersWant.html">polls</a> showed SF
<!--after 10 years hindsight,-->
wants to repeal IRV by 55-36%.
</p><p> <!--this para is 41 words, can drop if do not care about fact ballot wording was, illegally, deceptive:-->
Seattle's official <a href="http://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/whats-on-the-ballot/ballot-measures/202211/city-of-seattle-1B">wording</a>
<i>never mentions</i> "instant" or "runoff"(!), instead calling it "ranked choice."  
That's another deception &ndash; there
actually are hundreds of ranked-choice methods, e.g.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion">Condorcet</a>,
<!--were proposed in 1250-1435.  IRV came many centuries later.-->
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coombs%27_method">Coombs</a>-elimination, and
<a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/ReillySCSS.pdf">Nauru</a> island's method.
<!--decepto-wording insultingly pretends ranked-choice "means" IRV.-->
(It's as though Seattle redefined "human" to mean "white male.")

1976? Long time passing.
The USA's failure to adopt AV and 1A frustrated Fishburn
<!--and IRV baloney must have him spinning in his grave.-->
until
<a href="FargoStL.html">Fargo</a> enacted 1-winner approval by 64%,
then
