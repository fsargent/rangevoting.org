<h1> The 2006 election in Peru: </h1>
<h3> Thwarted-majority, non-monotonicity, and "no-show" pathologies </h3>

<p>
<a href="Peru06Exec.html">(Executive summary)</a>
</p>

<p>
This election is an apparent real-world example of the <i>failure</i>
of the plurality+runoff
system and presumably also of the <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV </a> (instant runoff) system.
The actual election was plurality with a second runoff election among the top two if
nobody got a majority (over 50%) in the first election.
[Voting is mandatory in Peru; you are fined if you don't.]
But the delayed and instant runoff systems happen to be <i>mathematically equivalent</i>
if the voters are consistent between rounds and
if there are &le;3 candidates.
</p>
<p>
Actually there were 20 candidates but 
it is <i>approximately</i> true there were only three since candidates 4-20 got a lot
fewer votes than the top three.
Instant and delayed runoff, in this case, therefore were <i>approximately</i> equivalent
(and exactly equivalent if the voters for candidates 4-20 felt the same about
candidates 1-3 relative to each other, as the 1-3 voters felt).
</p>

<p>
Pre-election polls consistently showed that
<i>one candidate (Flores) was pairwise-preferred over each of the other
two frontrunners</i>.  Specifically, pollees asked about a head-to-head contest
(hypothetical second round)
indicated they preferred Flores&gt;Humala by about a 55-to-45 margin,
and Humala&gt;Garcia,
by a slight margin (or some sources instead had Garcia&gt;Humala by a slight margin, 
e.g. from the <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14305460.htm">Miami Herald</a>
of 10 Apr 2006:
"Pre-election polls had shown that Flores would be favored over Humala to replace
outgoing President Alejandro Toledo, who cannot succeed himself. But Garcia
had little or no advantage against Humala in the pre-election polls.")

The last polls before the
election, by 
<a  href="http://www.cpi.com.pe/">Compania Peruana de Estudios de Mercado y Opinion Publica S.A.C. (CPI)</a> on 27-31 March
and independently by
Apoyo (see <i>El Comercio</i> 2 de abril del 2006) both
showed that Flores would win a runoff against either Humala
(55.1%-44.9%) or Garcia by a whopping
58.5%-41.5% based on 3896 people polled by CPI,
and (55-45 and 58-42) based on those polled by Apoyo.
Also
Conecta, UL, PUCP, UAP, and UNI also, in their last polls before the election,  <i>all</i>
found Lourdes Flores would have beaten or tied both of the others head-to-head,
making in total <i>7 independently-done
polls all reaching this same conclusion</i> during March 2006.

(<a href="PeruPolls06.html">local copy</a>)
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
And this would be compatible with the
official vote table below if, e.g,
those voters who voted for candidates 4-20 tended to prefer Lourdes Flores;
<!-- http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/431/humala.shtml 
  http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/025141.php
New York Times:
Flores, who topped polls only months ago, has played up her potential role 
as Peru's first female leader in a country where women are perceived as more honest.
Herald Sun News:http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,18836025%255E1702,00.html
Pre-election polls showed Mr Humala would face a tight runoff against Mr Garcia. 
If Mr Humala 
were to face Ms Flores, the polls suggested she would win.
-->
it also would be compatible with it provided that, to quote the
<a href="http://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/read_article.php?id=264623">Stratfor.com</a>
analysis,
"in a Flores-Humala contest, Flores would likely win a larger share of Garcia's
supporters 
than Garcia would gain among Flores' supporters."
</small>
<p>

<p>
<i>But</i>, Flores was eliminated in the first round!
</p>

<H3> Details </H3>
<p>
In the 9 April election,
no single presidential ticket obtained more than half of the total valid votes,
causing a runoff election (held 4 June 2006) between the two candidates with
the most votes &ndash;
Ollanta Humala and Alan Garcia.
Garcia grabbed the second runoff spot by only a thin margin over
Lourdes Flores, causing her to concede defeat only reluctantly.
(E.g, her margin of defeat was 8 times smaller than the number of "invalid ballots.")
Then in the runoff,
Humala conceded defeat to
Garcia when, with 77% of votes counted,
he found himself behind 45.5% to 55.5%.
(Although mathematically, victory was still possible
at that point, Humala evidently felt his chances were microscopic.
In my opinion, however, this concession decision by Humala was extremely unwise, because
as the table of final results shows, the final score moved very substantially away from
55.5-45.5, i.e. a <i>far</i> greater motion than any statistical analysis that assumed the 
initial count was a random subsample of the final count, could
consider probable.  Even though by the official tally Humala did indeed lose,
the probability of such a huge motion under the random subsample
assumption is <i>well</i> below 0.0000000000000001.)

<H3> Analysis </H3>

<p>
How could it be that the candidate pairwise-preferred over all others could lose &ndash; 
indeed lose in the <i>first</i> IRV voting round?!?
This can easily happen (and in Peru 2006, apparently did) as follows.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 35 </td>
<td> Left>Center>Right </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 14 </td>
<td> Center>Left>Right </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 17 </td>
<td> Center>Right>Left </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 34 </td>
<td> Right>Center>Left </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this 3-candidate 100-voter example IRV election by Jan Kok,
"Center" is eliminated in the <i>first</i> round,
and then, under the rules of the Instant (or delayed) Runoff System, Right ends up
with 34+17=51 ballots (a majority) to beat Left and win.
This happens even though the electorate prefers Center>Left by 65-to-35
and prefers Center>Right by 66-to-34, i.e. in both cases by nearly a 2-to-1 margin!
</p>

<p>
So don't believe IRV advocates who claim that they have never heard of any real 
IRV election in which 
pathologies occur, because that sort of thing is "incredibly rare."
Nonsense.
<small> 
<b>Caveat:</b> Greg Dennis points out (correctly) that we do not really know IRV would not have elected
Flores in Peru, because the 21% of the voters for candidates 4-20 might conceivably
have voted differently about the top 3 than the other 79% of the voters &ndash;
and differently-enough that they would have caused Flores to be the IRV winner.
</small>
</p>

<p>
The simplest scenario of this type is
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 2 </td>
<td> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 2 </td>
<td> B>A>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 1 </td>
<td> A>B>C  </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
in which A is the <a href="Glossary.html">Condorcet winner</a>
but is eliminated in the first <a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</a>
round.

<H3> Did this affect the candidates' strategies? </H3>

<p>
You bet it did!
As the election approached,
Garcia and Humala both realized Flores was the one Peru wanted, and both realized 
the only way for them to win was to eliminate her in the first round &ndash; precisely the
way that it happened.  They then
both ran anti-Flores negative ads designed to try to make that
happen.
</p>

<p>
<small>
IRV advocates sometimes claim that IRV will reduce "negative campaigning."
We do not know if that claim is true.  But we know it wasn't true in Peru 2006!
</small></p>

<H3> Would this affect voters' strategies? </H3>

<p>
Yes!
In this kind of scenario, if the Humala voters knew what was going to happen
(and preferred Flores as the lesser evil over Garcia)
then they would have been better off dishonestly ranking <i>Flores</i> top
and <i>betraying</i> their true favorite Humala.
That betrayal (in the runoff or <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
systems) would then cause Flores to win
over the hated Garcia.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Further, if we were (and Peru was) using <i>two round</i> runoff not "instant" runoff,
then this works even better:
the Humala voters could have just ranked Flores dishonestly top in the
<i>first</I> round.  That way, they are totally protected:  if Humala makes it
to the second round, they can always vote Humala in that round and still have 
their chance to elect him, whereas if not, then they are happy because Flores will
not allow Garcia to win.
</small>
</p>

<p>
So don't ever believe IRV advocates when they tell you that IRV solves the "spoiler"
problem and allows every voter to vote their honest favorite top without fear this will
"waste their vote" causing the "greater evil" to win.
Range voting solves that problem; IRV doesn't.  Somebody ought
to tell <a href="CobbIRVWrong.html">David Cobb</a> that.
</p>

<H3> Peru 2006 also exhibited "<a href="Monotone.html">nonmonotonicity</a>" </H3>

<p>
"Humala>Flores>Garcia" voters would have been better off dishonestly
voting their favorite Humala "worst"
(i.e. "Flores>Garcia>Humala") because that would have improved the election result for them,
making Flores win.
</p>
<p>
But it gets crazier: there is in fact a severe form of "nonmonotonicity."
Suppose they'd actually not only voted their true-favorite as "worst," but <i>also</i>
they'd voted their truly-most-hated Garcia artificially "best"!
I.e: "Garcia>Flores>Humala."
If just 63000 had done that (apparently trying to help Garcia)
that act of voting for Garcia would have <i>stopped</I> Garcia from winning
and made Flores win.
</p><P>
This maximally-dishonest vote ought to (if things acted logically) 
be a suicidal move influencing
things in the worst possible way.  But it isn't &ndash; it's a good strategy which
improves the election result, while voting honestly is a bad strategy.
</p>

<H3> Peru 2006 also exhibited "participation failure," a.k.a. "no-show paradox" </H3>

<p>
"Humala>Flores>Garcia" voters would have been better off if
about 60000 did not vote at all.
</p>

<p>

I thank Jan Kok and Rob LeGrand for  pointing this all out; and Rob LeGrand's brother
who was living in Peru at the time.
