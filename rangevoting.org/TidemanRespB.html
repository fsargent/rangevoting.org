<H2> Tideman Criticism of Range Voting &ndash; response by Jan Kok

T.N.Tideman [in email]:<br>
I agree that range is quite good if everyone is sincere, and not bad if
everyone is strategic so that it becomes Approval. I agree that in practice
you are likely to get the same amount of strategy on each side. What I don't
like is the pretense that people are supposed to vote sincerely when people who
understand what is going on have no qualms about voting strategically. If you
are going to have a system in which knowledgeable people use what looks like
approval voting, then in my view you should invite everyone to cast approval
votes. But I am not happy with approval either. I think we agree that under
approval the strategy that generally makes sense is to try to determine which
two candidates are most likely to be ranked first and second, and then give a
vote to the one you favor between these two, and to all candidates whom you
prefer to that candidate...
</p></td></tr></table>
<p>
More precisely, you could approve candidates you like slightly less
than the preferred frontrunner. For example, if you like the Dem and
dislike the Repub, and you like the Green slightly less than the Dem
but a lot more than the Repub, then it wouldn't hurt to approve the
Green also, and you might want to do so just to encourage the Greens
to keep trying.
</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" bgcolor="#ccffcc"><tr><td><p>
... If I wanted to devise an evaluation of Approval that
I regarded as informative, it would need to involve a statistical process that
reflected this understanding of how approval works in practice. But even if
that evaluation turned out well, it would make me uncomfortable to have a
voting procedure in which getting the most out of one's vote required one to
begin by figuring out who the two leading candidates were.

You have to estimate how others will vote with almost any voting
method, if you want to vote strategically. Let's compare several
voting methods with two situations: two party dominated situations
(like Florida 2000), and multiway elections with several strong
candidates and no reliable polling data ("non partisan" municipal
elections where the incumbent is not running for re-election can be
like that; or the TX governor race in 2006).
</p>
<H3>
Two-party dominated:
</H3>
<p>
Plurality: It's usually obvious when a race is two-party dominated. If
you are satisfied with voting for one of the frontrunners, then it's
easy to vote. If you want to vote for a third party, then you need to
estimate whether your favorite candidate would act as a spoiler.
</p><p>
Approval: Easy! Vote for your favorite frontrunner and anyone you like better.
</p><p>
IRV (and Condorcet, I think): Easy! Just vote honestly.
</p>
<H3>Multiway:</H3>
<p>
Suppose there are three candidates, Good, Middling, and Bad,
who are about equally likely to win. (Note that this is fairly common
in nonpartisan municipal elections.)
</p><p>
Plurality: It's a crap shot. If Bad wins and Middling comes in second,
you may kick yourself if you voted for Good.
</p><p>
Approval: Vote for Good. And if you like Middling better than the
midpoint between Good and Bad, vote for Middling also.
</p><p>
IRV: Voting by ranking is seductive. It seems as if you can just rank
the candidates honestly, and the voting method will make some
reasonable and fair choice of winner. But, as we know, IRV can fail to
choose the Condorcet winner, and it can reward strategic voting, among
other nasties. When there are three candidates of roughly equal
strength, you need to estimate whether voting Good > Middlling > Bad
could cause Bad to win, when strategically voting Middling > Good >
Bad might cause Middling to win instead.
</p><p>
Condorcet: If there are some "dark horse" candidates in the race,
Worse and Worst, voters will be tempted to rank their own personal
Good candidate 1st, then strategically rank the other two expected
frontrunners, Middling and Bad, behind the dark horse candidates. In
other words, vote Good > Worse > Worst > Middling > Bad. This voting
behavior, if widely practiced, can cause Worse to win. <i>Really</i> nasty
result!
</p><p>
Range: I think this is a situation where it makes some sense to vote
an intermediate value for Middling. Suppose there is just one other
voter besides yourself, and that voter will vote max for Bad and 0 for
Good, but you don't know what he will vote for Middling, so assume a
uniform distribution between 0 and max (and say max=1, i.e. 0-1 Range
with real values allowed). Say your utility for Good is 1 and for Bad
is 0, and for Middling is v. 
Then Good and Bad will both get average scores
of 0.5. The probability that Middling's average score is greater than
0.5 is equal to the score you give to Middling. (So if you give
Middling a score of 1, Middling's average score has probability=1 of
being greater than 0.5, and Middling would win.)
</p><p>
If Middling loses, the expected utility of the election is .5. If
Middling wins, the utility of the election is the utility of Middling,
which is v (for you). If you vote 1 for Middling, the utility of the
election is therefore v. If you vote 0 for Middling, the utility of
the election is 0.5.
</p><p>
Suppose you vote v for Middling. Your expected utility of the election
would be v&sup2; + 0.5(1-v). When v=0, 0.5 or 1, the expected utility of the
election from voting v is equal to the expected utility from voting
approval-style. The expected utility differs the most when v=0.25 or
.75. When v=.75, for example, voting Middling=.75 gets you an expected
utility of 11/16, which is 1/16 less than you would expect from voting
Middling=1. When v=0.25, voting Middling=0.25 gets you an expected
utility of 7/16, which is 1/16 less than you would expect from voting
Middling=0.
</p><p>
I usually vote honestly under Plurality voting, figuring it's worth
more to support my favorite party than to try to help the lesser evil
win. 
Therefore, I would have no qualms about voting v for Middling, even if
my expectation is lower by up to 1/16. One way of looking at it is, I
am "negotiating" with my opponent voters. If our average opinion of
Middling is better than the average of Good and Bad, then Middling
will win.
</p><p>
Some people complain that 0-10 (integer) Range Voting is too
fine-grained. They think some people would be paralyzed with
indecision about whether to give someone a 6 or a 7. But Approval
Voting is too coarse for me. If v=0.5, I would have a hard time
deciding whether to approve Middling or not. I would find it less
stressful to give Middling some intermediate value than to have to
choose all-or-nothing for Middling.
