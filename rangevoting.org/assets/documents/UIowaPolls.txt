UNIVERSITY OF IOWA SCORE-VOTING STYLE POLLS 1998-2000
=====================================================

The University of Iowa conducted (by telephone)
many large score-voting style polls during 1998-2000
in various mid-US states concerning political figures 
(prominent either nationally or important within that state
at that time).  Here are 28 such polls, each within a single 
state about a single politician (no politician repeated, and 
aiming for some variety in the states).

1. COLEMAN, NORM
Question: Let's talk about your feelings toward some prominent people.
I'll read the name of a person and ask you to rate that person on a
thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 degrees. A rating of 50 degrees is
neutral. Ratings between 51 and 100 degrees mean that you feel warm
toward that person, and ratings between 0 and 49 mean that you feel
cool toward that person. You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell
me how favorable or unfavorable your feelings are for each person. If
you don't recognize a particular person just tell me and we will go on
to the next name. How would you rate your feelings toward Norm Coleman
using this thermometer?

20. GARVEY, ED
Question: Let's talk about your feelings toward some prominent people.
I'll read the name of a person and ask you to rate that person on a
thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 degrees. A rating of 50 degrees is
neutral. Ratings between 51 and 100 degrees mean that you feel warm
toward that person, and ratings between 0 and 49 mean that you feel
cool toward that person. You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell
me how favorable or unfavorable your feelings are for each person. If
you don't recognize a particular person just tell me and we will go on
to the next name. How would you rate your feelings toward Ed Garvey
using this thermometer?
