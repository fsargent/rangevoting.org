            </b>There are no limits on campaign contributions from individuals 
            and PACs.&nbsp;However, contributions from corporations, labor unions, 
            and regulated industries are prohibited.</p>

            According to a study of the financing of Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
            elections from 1979 to 1997, slightly more than $17 million was 
            contributed to the thirty-five competitive supreme court candidates. 
            The legal profession, including the plaintiff's bar and large 
            defense-oriented law firms, accounted for more than half of this 
            amount. The remainder came primarily from pro-business individuals 
            and PACs. <i>See </i>James Eisenstein, &quot;Financing Pennsylvania's

            Another study conducted by the <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org"><u>Institute
            on Money in State Politics</u></a> showed that contributions to the
            thirty candidates for supreme court seats between 1989 and 1999
            totaled $13 million. Five of the candidates in contested races
            raised more than $1 million each. Slightly more than one fourth of
            the cases heard by the supreme court during this period involved
            campaign contributors. Click

            <p>
            In the 2001 elections, fourteen candidates for appellate seats 
            raised approximately $2.7 million, more than half of which came from 
            attorneys. In a race for a seat on the supreme court, the two 
            candidates reported campaign chests of more than $1 million each.<span style="font-family: Arial"> 
            These amounts did </span>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; ">not include substantial 
            expenditures by third parties such as the Law Enforcement Alliance 
            of America (LEAA). LEAA, a Virginia-based group, spent between 
            $300,000 and $600,000 on television advertisements touting one of 
            the supreme court candidates and portraying the other as being soft 
            on crime. The ads were suspended by a local judge after the LEAA 
            declined to comply with the state's financial disclosure 
            requirements. The order was later upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
            Court. Another group, Pennsylvania Law Watch, </span>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; ">distributed 
            analyses of the candidates' decisions that characterized one as 
            anti-business and the other as business-friendly. Democratic Party 
            leaders filed a suit alleging that Law Watch was in violation of the 
            state's election code, and as a result of a settlement, Law Watch 
            agreed not to engage in further attempts to influence voters in the 
            election. </span>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; ">The outcome of 
            the 2001 race shifted the composition of the supreme court from a 
            4-3 Democratic majority to a 4-3 Republican-dominated court.</span></p>

            64% of Pennsylvania judges expressed dissatisfaction with the 
            tone and conduct of judicial campaigns. 61% of judges 
            supported a generic proposal for public financing of judicial 
            elections, and 59% approved of a generic proposal for merit

            judges' courtroom decisions were influenced at least some of the
