Peter Kurrild-Klitsgaard:
An empirical example of the Condorcet paradox of voting in a large electorate
Public Choice 107 (2001) 135-145.

---

Classic examples are Riker's (1965; 1982; 1986) analysis of the fate of the DePew amendment 
in the US Senate in 1911 and the Powell amendment in the US House of Representatives in 1956, 
where he demonstrated the likely existence of a cycle by reconstructing the preferences of 
the various fractions. Similarly, Blydenburgh (1971) detected one instance of the paradox 
in the US House of Representatives in 1932 and another in 1938. Lewin(1996: 65ff; 1998: 200ff) 
hypothesized that a general cyclical collective preference existed among the Swedish 
political parties prior to the formation of the log-rolling coalition between the 
Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian Party in 1933. Lagerspaetz (1993;1997) studied 
ten presidential elections by the Finnish electoral college and found two,possibly three, 
examples of the empirical occurrence of cyclical collective preferences(1931, 1937 and 1956). 
More recently, Vergunst (1996) identified a likely instance of the paradox in a case treated
in the Second Chamber of the Dutch parliament in 1995, and in a 1998 study, Marcel Van Dam 
reportedly found another in a case treated in the same body in 1996. 
For other studies of the empirical relevance of the paradox of voting, see,
e.g, Riker (1958), Jamison (1975), Van den Doel (1979) and Dobra (1983).
