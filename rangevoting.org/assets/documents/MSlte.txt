LETTER TO EDITOR, NEW YORK TIMES
in reply to 
E.Maskin & A.Sen:
How Majority Rule Might Have Stopped Donald Trump,
NY Times, Thursday 28 April 2016.

=========


In "score voting," voters rate all candidates on 0-9 scale; highest
average wins.
 * Scoring your favorite top cannot hurt you.
 * Voting honestly cannot hurt you (versus not voting).
 * Voter exaggeration of the two major-party candidates to "top" and "bottom"
    doesn't preclude third-party victories.
 * Expresses not merely preferences, but strong & weak ones.
 * Allows leaving candidates unscored _without_ automatic conversion
    of their non-scores to "worst."
 * Successfully ran Venetian empire for centuries.
 * Simple, fully described rules.
 * Successful use by kindergarteners.
 * Always produces a winner; "cyclic tie" impossible.
 * If Joe wins in both the North and South, then necessarily
    he wins the combined (N+S) country.
 * Voters actually find it _more_ comprehensible than present system
    and it _reduces_ vote errors.
 * French voters prefer it versus their present voting system.
But Maskin & Sen's proposed voting system disobeys every one of those.
