Australia 2004 House Elections (held 9 Oct)
================Warren D. Smith============

150 total seats, IRV used to elect each.  
7.27 candidates on average per seat (1091 total for 150 seats).
[I do not think any seat had fewer than 4 contestants, but did not carefully count.]

The two top parties are the "National/Liberal/CLP" party (really effectively only 1 party but
since, historically, formed from smaller parties merging, seems like more; I suppose it is 
technically possible for all "three" of these parties to run candidates against the others but 
that is very rare, in fact I do not think it occurred in either 2004 or 2007 and Australian media
often calls this entity the "NatLib" party for short) -- and Labor.

89 Seats decided on first preferences
"A distribution of preferences was not necessary to determine the elected candidate."
