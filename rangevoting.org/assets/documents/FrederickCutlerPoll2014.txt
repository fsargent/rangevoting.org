1. Ballot Vote.
 
In this year's election for Governor between Paul LePage, the Republican, Mike Michaud, the
Democrat, and Eliot Cutler, an Independent - which one are you most likely to support?

Paul LePage  35 %
Mike Michaud 35 
Eliot Cutler 19 
Undecided    11 
This fresh poll of 400 voters conducted Tuesday, September 16th
and Wednesday, September 17th
shows LePage and Michaud in a dead heat at 35% and Eliot Cutler at 19%. 
A significant 11% remain undecided. 

2. Fluidity.
 Have you definitely decided who you will vote for
in the Governor's election, are you
leaning toward someone, or are you still trying to decide?

still deciding     23%
leaning            21
definitely decided 55

With 45% not yet "definitely decided" upon their vote, this 2014 election for Governor
remains fluid and open to change. Most of those "definitely decided"
are supporting Governor LePage. Among Michaud
voters, 40% are either just "leaning" toward him or "still deciding." This equals 14 of his
current 35 points.

3.  Eliot Cutler is the Clear Second Choice.
 
Which candidate for Governor would be your second choice?

Cutler(I)        54%
Michaud(D)       19
LePage(R)         6
None/Won't say   22

Fifty-four percent (54%) of Maine voters pick Eliot Cutler as their second choice. 
Cutler is the second choice of 84% of Michaud voters and 42% of LePage voters...
by far more acceptable than either party label candidate or even "none."

4. Cutler vs. LePage.
 
If the election for Governor were just a choice between Paul LePage and Eliot Cutler, 
which one -- LePage or Cutler -- would you support?

Eliot Cutler 50  %
Paul LePage  40
Undecided    10

Proof of Cutler's wider appeal comes in his 10-point advantage head-to-head with
LePage. Cutler gains 81% of Michaud's votes and even pulls a 54% to 12% lead from
the initial 11% undecided.

5. Ratings.
 
Favorable / Unfavorable (%)
Susan Collins 74 / 22  
Angus King    64 / 28 
Mike Michaud  58 / 35 
Eliot Cutler  46 / 37 
Paul LePage   43 / 54 

While Senator Collins holds strong favorable ratings heading into the final stretch of her 
reelection campaign, Independent Angus King (64-28) also has broad appeal across the state.

that Republican attempts to raise his negatives have so far fallen short. Cutler maintains a
