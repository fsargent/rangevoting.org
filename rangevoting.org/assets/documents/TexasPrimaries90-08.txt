Texas Primary Runoff Results 1992-2008
==============By Jim Riley============

This file (see data section at bottom) contains the results of all primary races for the 
Texas House from 1992 through 2008 in which there were 3 or more candidates (necessary
in order for there to be a possibility of a runoff). In that time there were
2700 possible primaries (9 elections X 2 parties X 150 districts) yielding 95
runoffs (3.5%).

There were an additional 53 races which had 3 candidates, but which were settled
by the primary election (52 cases of a majority, and one where the 2nd place
candidate withdrew), so 64% = 95/148 of the time when there 3 or more candidates, there
was a runoff (including the one case where a candidate withdrew).

Typically, a primary will attract more candidates when it is an open seat with
no incumbent in a district where there is a dominant political party. A
candidate wants a reasonable chance of success, so there is little reason to
challenge incumbents or compete to be the sacrificial lamb.

By year:

Year: #races with 3+ candidates; runoff; winner in primary won runoff; 2nd place in primary
won runoff.

1992: 30; 24; 16; 8;
1994: 16; 11;  6; 5;
1996: 17; 10;  9; 1;
1998: 11;  8;  4; 4;
2000:  5;  3;  2; 1;
2002: 27; 15; 13; 2;
2004: 10;  6;  4; 2;
2006: 23; 13; 10; 3;
2008:  9;  5;  5; 0;

Total: 148 3+ candidates; 95 runoffs; 69 winners in primary won runoff; 26
runner-up in primary won runoff (so 70% of the time, the plurality winner won
the runoff).

Note redistricting occurred prior to the 1992 and 2002 elections, which meant
some entirely new districts in some areas, and major changes in others; an
"incumbent" might face 80% new voters.

Some other characteristics:

3 candidates: 87; 44; 29; 15;  66%;  84%
4 candidates: 35; 26; 19;  7;  73%;  80%
5 candidates: 19; 18; 13;  5;  72%;  74%
6 candidates:  4;  4;  2;  2;  50%;  50%
7 candidates:  3;  3;  3;  0; 100%; 100%

Totals: 147 elections; 95 runoffs; 66 same result in primary and runoff; 29
different winner in primary and runoff; 66% of time leader in the primary won
the runoff; 81% of elections leader in primary won nomination, either outright
or via runoff.

In races with 3 candidates, about half required a runoff. The leader in the
primary, won the primary 66% of the time. In some cases, a 3-candidate primary
might have 3 candidates with about 1/3 of the vote, so that the leader after the
primary might have almost no advantage going into the runoff, especially if the
eliminated candidate endorsed the runner-up in the primary.

With 4 candidates, 74% of the races required a runoff; and with 5 or more
candidates, 96% required a runoff. This is not surprising. With 4 or 5
candidates receiving votes it is harder to gain a majority; and situations where
there was not a dominant candidate may encourage more candidates to run. But in
some cases, this may mean a dominate candidate requires a runoff, which might be
a reason for the greatly higher continued success in the runoff.

Margin:

0- 5%:  34; 34; 21; 13;  62%;
5-10%:  28; 28; 17; 11;  61%;
10-15%: 24; 18; 15;  3;  83%;
15-20%: 17; 12; 10;  2;  83%;
20-25%:  8;  2;  2;  0; 100%;
25-30%:  9;  1;  1;  0; 100%;
30-35%:  5;  0;
35-40%:  7;  0;
40-45%:  5;  0;
45-50%:  4;  0;
50-90%:  5;  0;

Totals: Plurality in primary between 1st and 2nd; Number of primaries 147;
Number of runoffs 95; with same winner in runoff and primary 66; different
winner 29; and percent success for the leader in the primary to win the runoff.

A lack of large pluralities in races requiring a runoff is not surprising. In a
3-candidate race, a candidate with a 20% plurality will have at least 46-2/3% of
the total vote (and a tie between the 2nd and 3rd place candidates with
26-1/3%). Even if he is forced to a runoff, it would be very difficult to
overcome that margin. A candidate with a 25% plurality will have a majority in
a 3-candidate race.

The 3 instances where a candidate had a 20%+ plurality, yet required a runoff
were (47-22-16-15), (47-23-20-10), (49-28-22) or races in which the leader had
all but a majority.

On the other hand, when there is a small plurality, we would expect there to be
a runoff in a 3-candidate race. If the 3rd (and any other trailing also-ran)
garner a modest 10% of the vote, then a leader with a plurality of less than 10%
can not have a majority, and will face a runoff. And if there is a small
plurality, then we would expect a reasonable possibility for the 2nd place
candidate to win the runoff (it would require an extreme level of cynicism to
expect that most races would flip in a runoff).

Eliminated:

0- 5%:  11;  1;  1; 0; 100%;
5-10%:  16;  3;  2; 1; 67%;
10-15%: 10:  2;  2; 0; 100%;
15-20%: 26; 13; 10; 3; 77%;
20-25%: 16; 10;  9; 1; 90%;
25-30%: 27; 25; 15; 10; 60%;
30-35%: 18; 18; 12; 6; 67%;
35-40%:  8;  8;  5; 3; 62%;
40-45%:  8;  8;  6; 2; 75%;
45-50%:  3;  3;  0; 3; 0%;
50-55%:  3;  3;  3; 0; 100%;
55-60%:  1;  1;  1; 0; 100%;

Totals: Percentage garnered by eliminated candidates (3rd and trailing
candidates for elections with outright winner in primary); number of primaries
147; number of runoffs 95; same winner in primary and runoff 66; flip in runoff
29; percentage% of primary winner prevailing in runoff 66%.

For a runoff, the candidates will want their supporters to return for the
runoff. In a race for a Texas House seat, many voters will have turned out to
vote in presidential, gubernatorial, congressional, or other more prominent
races, and simply voted in the House race because it was on the ballot. They
may be difficult to motivate to turn out a second time. The key to a flip in a
runoff may be differential turnout among supporters of the two candidates.

Candidates may want to encourage voters who skipped the primary to turn out for
the runoff. This may be extremely hard, since these voters will also have
avoided voting in more prominent races. And runoff candidates may try to get
supporters of the other candidate to switch. But unless the primary vote was
irrational or totally uninformed, why would a voter switch his vote?

Runoff candidates will also want to try to get supporters of the eliminated
candidates to switch to them, and seek the endorsement of the eliminated
candidates. Getting those voters to return may be a challenge, since their
favored candidate was eliminated. On the other hand, in an IRV election, these
voters are the only source of transfers that can change the order of the first
count.

So these votes might be regarded as the fuel for a possible flip in the runoff. 
If you trail by 10%, and the eliminated candidates represent 20% of the vote,
you will need 75% of them to vote for you in order for there to be a flip. If
they represent 40% of the vote, you will only need to get the support of 62.5%
of them.

In 84% of cases where the trailing candidates had 15% or less of the vote, no
runoff was needed. Not surprising since there is 85% or more available for the
two remaining candidates - unless the race is particularly close, the leader
will likely have a majority. In the relatively few instances where a runoff was
required, the leader in the primary won the runoff. So minimal 3rd candidate
support will usually result in no runoff, or the primary winner winning the
nomination (97%).

If the trailing candidates have between 15% and 25% of the vote, there is a
runoff 45% of the time, but the primary plurality winner prevails 83% of the
time in the runoff. The 3rd candidate support was sufficient about half the
time to prevent a majority in the primary, but not enough to produce a flip in
the runoff.

On the other hand, in 97% of cases where the trailing candidates had 25% or more
of the vote, a runoff was required. The primary plurality winner won the runoff
64% of the time. So if there is enough 3rd candidate support, it almost always
prevents a majority, and also provides a fair chance for a flip in the runoff.

Support in First Round:

20-25%:  2;  2;  0; 100%;
25-30%:  6;  3;  3; 50%;
30-35%: 15;  9;  6; 60%;
35-40%: 29; 17; 12; 59%;
40-45%: 25; 19;  6; 76%;
45-50%: 18; 16;  2; 89%;
50-55%: 19;
55-60%: 14;
60-65%:  7;
65-70%:  7;
70%+ :   5;

Totals: Percentage vote for leading candidate in primary; Number of primaries
with 3 or more candidates (and number of runoffs when leading candidate had less
than 50% of vote) 147 (and 95); number of runoffs won by primary leader, 66;
number of flips in runoff, 29; and percentage of runoffs won by primary leader,
66%.

When the primary leader is held to under 40%, they won the runoff only 60% of
the time. In a 3-way race, if the leader has 40%, then the 2nd place candidate
has at least 30%, and there a lot of votes available from other candidates. If
the leader has 35%, then 65% of voters did not vote for him, but rather voted
for the 2nd place candidate, or candidates who were eliminated. So it would be
expected that these races were more of a toss-up.

If the primary leader had over 40%, they won the runoff 81% of the time. They
received close to a majority in the primary, and they may have a relatively
large lead over the 2nd place candidate (eg 42-30-28). If the 2nd place
candidate is close, then the 3rd place candidate will have relatively little
support.

There were 8 elections where the primary leader had over 40%, but lost the
runoff. In three of these elections, the leader blew a relative large lead, but
in all three there was a sharp drop in turnout, indicating the key was
differential turnout among supporters of the two candidates:

Support in primary; Support in runoff; Relative turnout:

44%-29%-26%;     44%-56%; 56%
40%-31%-28%;     47%-52%; 47%
42%-31%-14%-13%; 40%-60%; 47%

In 3 other elections, the primary was relative close, and turnout for the runoff
was somewhat comparable to the primary. In those cases, the flip may have been
due to the ability of the 2nd place candidate to gain a large share of the vote
from supporters of the eliminated candidates, plus modest turnout differential
among supporters of the two runoff candidates. In all 3 elections, the leader
in the primary _did_ receive a slightly greater share of the total vote in the
runoff.

43%-38%-19%;      47%-53%; 93%.
47%-43%-4%-3%-2%; 49%-51%; 79%.
43%-42%-15%;      45%-55%; 76%.

The final two elections, there was a large reversal in the runoff, as well as
high relative turnout. In one case, in a suburban GOP race, pictures of the
primary leader as a cross-dresser became public about the time of the primary. 
In the other case, in a black district, the primary leader and long-term
incumbent came under ridicule for his sponsorship of a bill (nicknamed the booty
bill) that would have (attempted to) outlaw suggestive dance routines by high
school cheerleaders.

42%-33%-25%;  40%-60%;  91%.
48%-33%-19%;  46%-54%;  88%
