Text of Letter of apology  from the 
Commission on Presidential Debates To Ralph Nader 

Dear Mr. Nader:

In October 2000, you filed a lawsuit against the Commission
on Presidential Debates and its co-chairs, Paul Kirk and
Frank Fahrenkopf, in which you asserted claims concerning
your ticketed right to enter an auxiliary viewing auditorium
on the UMass campus on October 3, 2000, the night of the
presidential debate. 

The Commission and its co-chairs did not know about your
interest in attending the auxiliary viewing auditorium.
If we had had a clear understanding of your intentions,
every effort would have been made to protect your right to
attend that event. We apologize for the misunderstanding of
John Vezeris, the security consultant for the Commission, 
on the night of October 3 that resulted in your being
required to leave the campus so that you could not attend
the auxiliary viewing event and for any inconvenience to you. 

For the Commission and its co-chairs, 
Paul Kirk and Frank Fahrenkopf, 
  Sincerely,
Janet Brown  Executive Director
