Abstract:      
Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV/RCV) is a relatively new reform to the rules of 
voting and elections that has been adopted by several cities. The impact of
IRV/RCV balloting on racial group voter turnout in urban elections has not
been subject to rigorous empirical analysis. In order to evaluate the 
relationship between IRV/RCV and voter turnout, I analyze precinct-level racial
group voter turnout rates in five San Francisco mayoral elections from 1995 to 2011.
I find significant declines in turnout under IRV/RCV rules, especially among Black voters.
Variation in racial group turnout is best explained by factors related to candidate
race and racial group competition. In addition, I find that IRV/RCV exacerbates
turnout disparities between older and younger groups in the population and
between those with high education compared to those with low education.
