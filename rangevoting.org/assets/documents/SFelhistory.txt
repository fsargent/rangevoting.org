San Francisco elections held by IRV (instant runoff) and ordinary top-2-runoff (T2R)
===================Warren D. Smith=====Nov 2009======================================

SF switched to using "bastardized-top-3-only IRV,"  (which I will abbreviate IRV3)
instead of T2R (top-2-runoff), holding first IRV3 election in November 2004.

HOW MANY VOTERS *USED* IRV-STYLE VOTING?
In 2007, many SF Voters did not utilize the option to rank choices. 94% of absentee voters
did not list 3 choices on their ballots in the November municipal election, even though 
there were 9 candidates for mayor.

WHAT WERE THE *COSTS*?
Costs of running SF elections escalated rather severely.
From San Francisco's Budget Reports, here are actual net expenditures per year by SF election dept:
2000-2001  $ 9,024,000
2001-2002  $13,872,000 [includes $1,322,849 for a runoff election & $150,000 litigation costs]
2002-2003  $ 8,610,553
2003-2004  $15,204,781  --switchover to IRV
2004-2005  $10,400,868
2005-2006  $11,930,228
2006-2007  $10,062,052 (actual expense; originally budgeted=$9,126,318)
2007-2008  $14,839,686 (actual expense; originally budgeted=$19,809,917)

These figures on their face certainly seem to suggest IRV leads to a cost-increase, but
it could be counter-argued that after the Florida 2000 election fiasco, a lot of election
departments around the USA changed procedures (encouraged also by new federal laws) in ways
that in some cases increased costs.  A more-detailed look into their budgets might
be more informative.

WHAT HAPPENED TO VOTER *ERROR RATES*?
They skyrocketed with IRV, up by about a factor of 7 in San Francisco.

WHAT WERE THE ELECTION *RESULTS* IN THE INSTANT-RUNOFF (IRV) ERA?

2010 (http://sfelections.org/results/20101102/  and skip down to the RCV ones):
NONE of the 5 IRV elections in 2010 yielded a majority winner (ignoring the
uncontested supervisor#4 race).
ONE of the 5 yielded an IRV winner differing from the plain plurality winner --
making this the first time that happened in San Fran+Oakland combined history.
This was the Malia Cohen super#10 race.

Supervisor#2: Janet Reilly wins with 41.09% in 1st and
11168/28911=38.6% in final rnd   (6 canddts+writein)

Supervisor#4: Carmen Chu wins with 98.56% (uncontested except by writeins)

Supervisor#6: Jane Kim wins with 31.41% in 1st and 8865/25057=35.4% in final rnd
(14 canddts+writein)

Supervisor#8: Scott Wiener wins with 42.41% in 1st and
18239/38551=47.3% in final rnd
(4 canddts+writein)
http://sfelections.org/results/20101102/data/d8.html

Supervisor#10: Malia Cohen wins with 4321=21%
  note DIFFERENT FROM Lynette Sweet who won 1st round with 12.07%
  21 candidates+write-in which made "top 3 only" IRV look pretty silly
  20550 total ballots, 500 totally spoiled (2.4%) plus more partially spoiled
  http://sfelections.org/results/20101102/data/d10.html

 Rounds 18-20 were crucial and all very close:
Round 18:
Cohen 3501  (wins in round 20)
Kelly 3392
Tran 3231 (falls in round 19)
Sweet 3201 (eliminated and lots more of her votes transfer to Cohen
 than anybody else, but the vast majority of Sweet votes die here as exhausted)

Round 19:
Cohen 4120
Kelly 3576
Tran 3330 (eliminated and almost all her ballots die here as exhausted)

Final Round 20:
Cohen 4321=21.0%  (wins)
Kelly 3879=18.9%

So obviously the exhaustion fraction was very high and 60.1%, i.e. a
large majority, of all voters were prevented from deciding (i.e. prevented from 
having any impact whatever on) the final choice between the two ultimate
frontrunners Kelly & Cohen.
   This is somewhat better than plain plurality because 76.4% of the voters failed
to top-rank either Kelly or Cohen and 76.4>60.1.   But not a whole lot better.

Speculation: IRV3 may actually have been worse because the 39.9% of voters
who got to have a say about Kelly vs Cohen, may have been a "more
biased sample" of the voters, thanks to the IRV3 process which may or
may not have served to amplify sample bias.  (For example, if voters
who favored Kelly>Cohen tended to rank several candidates ahead of Kelly, while
voters who favored Cohen>Kelly tended to rank only one above Cohen, then the IRV3 
process would "amplify sample bias" causing Cohen to win the final round even though
a majority preferred Kelly>Cohen.  I have not tried to analyse the ballots to decide
whether that actually happened; I am just explaining one possible mechanism
for amplification of bias by the IRV3 process.)
   Indeed, in the final round,  even full IRV (as opposed to IRV3)
would also have had a lot of trouble because IRV is designed to work well in
"2 and a half"-candidate races, not 4-candidate close races like this.
Range Voting works pretty well even in "3 and a half" candidate races.

Further Speculation:
This race may have suffered IRV "paradoxes."
 One possible paradox that MIGHT have happened is, suppose
31  Tran>Sweet>...>Cohen voters got killed before they made it to the
polling place.
Then Tran would have been eliminated in round 18.  Perhaps a lot
of Tran votes would have transferred to Sweet... enough to make her win.
If so,  by thus removing Cohen-bottom and Sweet-near-top
voters, we would have HURT Cohen(!) and HELPED Sweet.
This can also be viewed as a monotonicity-like failure:
these 31 voters by demoting Tran & Sweet to bottom would have made Sweet win.
This all currently is speculation, but the fact there were 21 canddts makes the
number of possible IRV-funny-business routes enormous hence probably
some of them work.

***Nov 2009:***
City Attorney & Treasurer both elected uncontested.

***Nov 2007:***
Mayor: Gavin Newsom wins by an enormous margin vs 11 rivals (as well as 6 write-in candidates). 
IRV process not needed.
Newsom 105596; Mecke 9076; Hoogasian 8400; Pang 7274; Sumchai 3398; Rinaldi 2508; Holmes 1807; 
Wolf 1772; Kaplan 1423; Brown 915; Libertarian 644; Powers 519, others all below 10 each.
Total votes 143359.
The total vote dataset is here:    http://rangevoting.org/SF07HumanRead.txt
and shows there were 67590 "bullet" votes for Newsom,
3825 for Hoogasian, 2539 for Pang, 1170 for Mecke, 590 for Sumchai, and 349 for Rinaldi.
In all that is over 76063 (53%) of the IRV ballots were "bullet" style.
The total number of candidates ranked on those ballots amounted to below
187% of the total number of ballots.

***Nov 2006:***
Supervisor District 2: IRV process not needed, clear majority in 1st round.

Supervisor District 4: ED JEW  wins with 8388 in round#4.
Same winner as with plain-plurality.  
(But Ron Dudum almost won the first round -- 50 votes behind.)  
19814 eligible ballots cast.
(SEE BOTTOM FOR SF CHRONICLE EDITORIAL INSPIRED BY THIS ELECTION, WHICH ITS
AUTHOR, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, REGARDS AS A DISASTER.
LATER NOTE [January 2010]: Ed Jew is currently residing in prison for 64 month
sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to extorting $80,000 in cash from local business
owners.)

Supervisor District 6: CHRIS DALY wins with 8968 in round#5.
That is 49.98% of the 17941 eligible ballots cast.

Supervisor District 8: IRV process not needed, clear majority in 1st round.

Supervisor District 10: IRV process not needed, clear majority in 1st round.

***Nov 2005:***
Assessor-Recorder:
Phil Ting won in all rounds of the IRV process (3 candidates).
He got a 54% majority in the final round.

***Nov 2004:***
Supervisor District 1:
Jake McGoldrick wins vs 6 rivals with 14011 votes in the final IRV round (48.67% of total cast)
vs Lillian Sing (11929).   McGoldrick also won every earlier IRV round, although with fewer 
votes, e.g. he won the first [plain plurality] round with 11815 votes.
There were 28787 eligible ballots cast.

Supervisor District 3: IRV process not needed, clear majority in 1st round.

Supervisor District 5: ROSS MIRKARIMI wins with 13211 in round#19.
35109 eligible ballots cast.

Supervisor District 7: SEAN R. ELSBERND wins with 13834 in round#11.
Same winner as with plain-plurality. 31639 eligible ballots cast.

Supervisor District 9: IRV process not needed, clear majority in 1st round.

Supervisor District 11: GERARDO SANDOVAL wins with 10679 in round#11.
Same winner as with plain-plurality.  23176 eligible ballots cast.

SUMMARY OF IRV ERA:
19 elections looked at.   IRV process actually needed (pseudo-runoff) in 11
Every IRV winner (except one, superv#10 in 2010) also was a plain-plurality winner.
Due to "ballot exhaustion," no IRV winner (on occasions
when the IRV process was actually needed) ever got a majority 
(i.e. over 50%) of the eligible ballots, in any round, EXCEPT for Ting in the 2005
Assessor-Recorder race.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE EDITORIAL Sunday, 10 June 2007
Now, how did this guy get elected?
by John Diaz

IN RECENT years, San Francisco voters have set up systems promising to
encourage the election of citizen-politicians from the neighborhoods
and to raise voter participation and the prospects that our elected
leaders arrive in office with a "mandate."

So, how did it come to pass that the city's newest supervisor, Ed Jew,
apparently did not even live in the Sunset District and was the choice
of just 5125 (or 26.2 percent) of voters? And the FBI is looking into
what this "citizen politician" was doing with $40,000 in cash from
tapioca-shop owners who had sought his help with city permits.

It turns out that both of the voter-installed "reforms" -- district
elections, instant-runoff voting -- helped make it possible for the
flower-shop operator, who once served as vice chairman of the local
Republican Party, to get elected in San Francisco on a "grassroots"
campaign.

District elections, reinstituted in 2000, have turned the races for
San Francisco's 11 supervisorial seats into mini mob scenes to
represent districts that each contain about the population of the city
of San Leandro. One of the arguments against district elections is
that, in running to represent these 11 territories, candidates may
lose sight of their larger responsibilities as a custodian of citywide
and even regional matters.

Jew certainly played to provincial concerns, such as water rates,
potholes and neighborhood schools. He shook a lot of hands. He spent
$80,000 of his own money, courted the Chinese-language press and let
the convention wisdom anoint Doug Chan and Janyry Mak as perceived
frontrunners. In what might be an unthinkable gaffe for most serious
candidates, he arrived an hour late for The Chronicle's
endorsement-interview session, sitting down just as the other five
candidates were getting ready for closing statements. He blamed Muni.

San Francisco's system of electing supervisors did not require him to
win over very many of the city's voters -- and he did not. On election
day, 73.8 percent of the voters in District 4 expressed a preference
for someone other than Ed Jew.

In the old days, Jew would have been forced into a runoff against Ron
Dudum, the candidate who was just 53 votes behind, with 25.96 percent
of the vote. Jew's belated switch from Republican to Democrat and
questions about his family residence in Burlingame surely would have
been significant issues in a one-on-one race against a lifelong
Democrat and lifelong Sunset resident.

"I always thought if Ed and I were in a runoff, I would have had a
good chance," Dudum said in a interview last week.

But under San Francisco's instant-runoff voting system, voters never
had a chance to further scrutinize and choose between Jew and Dudum.
Voters had been asked to rank a second and third choice. The runoff
was conducted by automation, knocking out the lowest-scoring candidate
on each round. Dudum led after two rounds, but lacked a majority. Jew
ultimately prevailed in the fourth round.

"At least in a runoff, you win or you lose, there's no in-between,"
Dudum said. "With ranked-choice voting, you don't allow people to
think. It's programming. It's terrible public policy."

Ed Jew went to City Hall and, within months of taking the oath of
office, the FBI is shaking down his quarters at home and work in
connection with a curious $40,000 cash transaction.

Jew offered rather preposterous explanations for how someone could
live in a house on 28th Avenue without turning on the faucets or even
giving neighbors the impression that it might be occupied.

Then there is his equally implausible contention that he just could
not say "no" when the businessmen who sought his advice for permits
insisted that he relay the $20,000 cash fee to a consultant he
recommended -- along with $20,000 in cash for a donation to a
neighborhood park group that did not know it was coming and did not
receive any of it until after the FBI raid.

If Jew remains mired in denial, at some point Mayor Gavin Newsom will
have to initiate official misconduct proceedings, which could lead to
Jew's dismissal with a vote of eight of his 10 fellow supervisors.

In the meantime, we might need to start asking candidates to bring
their utility bills when they come in for endorsement meetings.
--end.
