<h3>Macintosh HTML editors</h3>

<p>There are no HTML editors that make use of Mac OS 9&#8217;s built-in support for Unicode TrueType fonts, so Mac users are restricted to typing in languages for which <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_fonts_mac.html#apple#apple">Language Kits</a> are available.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#word98#word98">Word 98</a> and <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#word2001#word2001">Word 2001</a> word processors running under Mac OS 9 can use one or more Language Kits to produce multilingual HTML documents with UTF-8 <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/#encodings#encodings">character encoding</a>.  These documents include specified fonts, but they still seem to display correctly in Internet Explorer and Netscape browsers on Windows systems that have alternative fonts for the appropriate scripts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#bbedit#bbedit">BBEdit 6</a> is a text editor with many facilities to help produce HTML documents.  The editing screen always has the HTML tags visible, and so you have to use a Web browser for previewing pages.  It can be used to produce Web pages containing any of the left-to-right scripts for which there are Language Kits, but not Arabic or Hebrew.  Documents can contain several scripts, but only one script at a time is displayed correctly.  It can open and save HTML files with UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#composer6#composer6">Netscape Composer 7</a> can produce and edit HTML files in any of the languages and scripts for which Language Kits are installed.  It can work in WYSIWYG or text modes, and it can open and save files with UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#muwse#muwse">Muwse</a> (formerly called Unisite) is an HTML editor that can display simultaneously any of the languages and scripts for which Language Kits are installed.  It uses Web browsers for previewing pages.  It can save HTML files with UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#golive#golive">Adobe GoLive 5</a> is an HTML editor that can display simultaneously any of the left-to-right languages and scripts for which Language Kits are installed.  It can work in WYSIWYG and code visible modes, and can open and save HTML files with UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<p>Adobe InDesign 1.5 can export files as HTML with UTF-8 character encoding, but it does not support the fonts or keyboard drivers in the Language Kits.  It can use Unicode Macintosh TrueType fonts (such as the Tahoma font supplied with Office 98 and Word 98), but characters not in MacRoman have to entered from the Select Character ... dialog box on the Type menu.</p>

<p>Other WYSIWYG HTML editors (such as Dreamweaver 4 and Freeway 3) that run under Mac OS 9 are not able to use UTF-8 character encoding.  They do support some encodings for non-Latin scripts, but these restrict you to typing in Latin plus one other script, such as Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese or Korean.  They do not support Arabic or Hebrew.  The multilingual word processor <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_mac.html#nisus#nisus">Nisus Writer</a> can save files as HTML, but not with UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<h3>Windows HTML editors</h3>

<p>Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP all support Unicode TrueType fonts and so can display almost any character on-screen.  They also allow you to type in more scripts than Mac OS 9; Windows XP has the most keyboard drivers.</p>

<p>There are four well-known WYSIWYG HTML editors for Windows that can use UTF-8 <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/#encodings#encodings">character encoding</a>, Macromedia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html#dreamweaver#dreamweaver">Dreamweaver MX</a>, Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html#golive#golive">GoLive</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html#fp2003#fp2003">FrontPage</a> and <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html#namo#namo">Namo WebEditor</a>.  All four programs can use any keyboard driver that is available under Windows.  GoLive 5 can use the <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_fonts.html#visual#visual">Visual Keyboards</a> (useful if you are not very familiar with a particular keyboard layout), but not the Global IMEs that you to type in several scripts and to save multilingual documents in HTML format with UTF-8 encoding.  Word 2000 (but not Word 97) supports the <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_fonts.html#globalime#globalime">Global IMEs</a> and the <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_fonts.html#visual#visual">Visual Keyboards</a>.  Support for Thai and some Indian languages is available in  <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors.html#word2002#word2002">Word 2002</a>.  If you want to use HTML files from Word 2000 on a Web site, be sure to obtain the <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Msohtmf2.aspx">HTML Filter 2.0</a> from the Microsoft Office Download Center to remove the Office-specific markup tags; Word 2002 has this built-in.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 Web browsers can convert HTML documents into UTF-8 character encoding, provided that the original file uses one of the encodings on the View &gt; Encoding menu.  Simply display the file, make sure that the encoding and the display are correct, and then choose Save As on the File menu.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://rangevoting.org/ie5_saveutf8.gif" width="381" height="92" alt="Saving a page in UTF-8 encoding"></p>

<p>HomeSite 5 can open and save files with UTF-8 character encoding, but only supports typing with the ANSI character set.<!-- Dreamweaver 4 is not able to use UTF-8 character encoding, and appears to have no support for Unicode. --></p>
