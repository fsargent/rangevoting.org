<H1> Richard Feynman tries to improve school textbooks </H1>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1964 the Nobel-prize physicist Richard P. Feynman served on the State
of California's Curriculum Commission and saw how the Commission
chose math textbooks for use in California's public schools.  In his
acerbic memoir of that experience, titled "Judging Books by Their
Covers," Feynman analyzed the Commission's idiotic method of
evaluating books, and described some of the tactics employed by
schoolbook salesmen who wanted the Commission to adopt their shoddy
products.  "Judging Books by Their Covers" appeared as a chapter in 
<I>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</I> &ndash;
Feynman's autobiographical book that was published in 1985
by W.W. Norton &amp; Company.  This essay is reprinted here for your enjoyment.
(His title is motivated by the fact that one publisher sent California multiple copies of
a "textbook" consisting entirely of blank pages.  It was given high marks.)

<H2>Judging Books by Their Covers</H2>

<H4>Richard P. Feynman</H4>

<p>
I was giving a series of freshman physics lectures [in 1964], and
after one of them, Tom Harvey, who assisted me in putting on the
demonstrations, said, "You oughta see what's happening to
mathematics in schoolbooks!  My daughter comes home with a lot of
crazy stuff!"
</p><p>
I didn't pay much attention to what he said.
</p><p>
But the next day I got a telephone call from a pretty famous lawyer
here in Pasadena, Mr. Norris, who was at that time on the State
Board of Education.  He asked me if I would serve on the State
Curriculum Commission, which had to choose the new schoolbooks for
the state of California.  You see, the state had a law that all of
the schoolbooks used by all of the kids in all of the public schools
have to be chosen by the State Board of Education, so they have a
committee to look over the books and to give them advice on which
books to take.
</p><p>
It happened that a lot of the books were on a new method of
teaching arithmetic that they called "new math," and since usually
the only people to look at the books were schoolteachers or
administrators in education, they thought it would be a good idea to
have somebody who <I>uses</I> mathematics scientifically, who knows
what the end product is and what we're trying to teach it for, to
help in the evaluation of the schoolbooks.
</p><p>
I must have had, by this time, a guilty feeling about not
cooperating with the government, because I agreed to get on this
committee.
</p><p>
<I>Immediately</I> I began getting letters and telephone calls from
schoolbook publishers.  They said things like, "We're very glad to
hear you're on the committee because we really wanted a scientific
guy . . ." and "It's wonderful to have a scientist on the committee,
because our books are scientifically oriented . . ."  But they also
said things like, "We'd like to explain to you what our book is
about . . ." and "We'll be very glad to help you in any way we can
to judge our books . . ."  That seemed to me kind of crazy.  I'm an
objective scientist, and it seemed to me that since the only thing
the kids in school are going to get is the books (and the teachers
get the teacher's manual, which I would also get), any <I>extra</I>
explanation from the company was a distortion.  So I didn't want to
speak to any of the publishers and always replied, "You don't have
to explain; I'm sure the books will speak for themselves."
</p><p>
I represented a certain district, which comprised most of the Los
Angeles area except for the city of Los Angeles, which was
represented by a very nice lady from the L.A. school system named
Mrs. Whitehouse.  Mr. Norris suggested that I meet her and find out
what the committee did and how it worked.
</p><p>
Mrs. Whitehouse started out telling me about the stuff they were
going to talk about in the next meeting (they had already had one
meeting; I was appointed late).  "They're going to talk about the
counting numbers."  I didn't know what that was, but it turned out
they were what I used to call integers.  They had different names
for everything, so I had a lot of trouble right from the start.
</p><p>
She told me how the members of the commission normally rated the new
schoolbooks.  They would get a relatively large number of copies of
each book and would give them to various teachers and administrators
in their district.  Then they would get reports back on what these
people thought about the books.  Since I didn't know a lot of
teachers or administrators, and since I felt that I could, by
reading the books myself, make up my mind as to how they looked to
<I>me,</I> I chose to read all the books myself. . . .

<CENTER><H2>&#149;</H2></CENTER>

<p>
A few days later a guy from the book depository called me up and
said, "We're ready to send you the books, Mr. Feynman; there are
three hundred pounds."
</p><p>
I was overwhelmed.
</p><p>
"It's all right, Mr. Feynman; we'll get someone to help you read
them."
</p><p>
I couldn't figure out how you <I>do</I> that: you either read them
or you don't read them.  I had a special bookshelf put in my study
downstairs (the books took up seventeen feet), and began reading all
the books that were going to be discussed in the next meeting.  We
were going to start out with the elementary schoolbooks.
</p><p>
It was a pretty big job, and I worked all the time at it down in
the basement.  My wife says that during this period it was like
living over a volcano.  It would be quiet for a while, but then all
of a sudden, <b>"BLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!"</b> &ndash; there would be a big
explosion from the "volcano" below.
</p><p>
The reason was that the books were so lousy.  They were false.  They
were hurried.  They would <I>try</I> to be rigorous, but they would
use examples (like automobiles in the street for "sets") which were
<I>almost</I> OK, but in which there were always some subtleties. 
The definitions weren't accurate.  Everything was a little bit
ambiguous &ndash; they weren't <I>smart</I> enough to understand what was
meant by "rigor."  They were faking it.  They were teaching
something they didn't understand, and which was, in fact,
<I>useless,</I> at that time, for the child.
</p><p>
I understood what they were trying to do.  Many [Americans] thought
we were behind the Russians after Sputnik, and some mathematicians
were asked to give advice on how to teach math by using some of the
rather interesting modern concepts of mathematics.  The purpose was
to enhance mathematics for the children who found it dull.
</p><p>
I'll give you an example: They would talk about different bases of
numbers &ndash; five, six, and so on &ndash; to show the possibilities.  That
would be interesting for a kid who could understand base ten &ndash; 
something to entertain his mind.  But what they turned it into, in
these books, was that <I>every</I> child had to learn another base! 
And then the usual horror would come: "Translate these numbers,
which are written in base seven, to base five."  Translating from
one base to another is an <I>utterly useless</I> thing.  If you
<I>can</I> do it, maybe it's entertaining; if you <I>can't</I> do
it, forget it.  There's no <I>point</I> to it.
</p><p>
Anyhow, I'm looking at all these books, all these books, and none of
them has said anything about using arithmetic in science.  If there
are any examples on the use of arithmetic at all (most of the time
it's this abstract new modern nonsense), they are about things like
buying stamps.
</p><a name="temp"></a><p>
Finally I come to a book that says, "Mathematics is used in science
in many ways.  We will give you an example from astronomy, which is
the science of stars."  I turn the page, and it says, "Red stars
have a temperature of four thousand degrees, yellow stars have a
temperature of five thousand degrees . . ." &ndash; so far, so good.  It
continues: "Green stars have a temperature of seven thousand
degrees, blue stars have a temperature of ten thousand degrees, and
violet stars have a temperature of . . . (some big number)."  There
are no green or violet stars, but the figures for the others are
roughly correct.  It's <I>vaguely</I> right &ndash; but already, trouble! 
That's the way everything was: Everything was written by somebody
who didn't know what the hell he was talking about, so it was a
little bit wrong, always!  And how we are going to teach well by
using books written by people who don't <I>quite</I> understand what
they're talking about, I <I>cannot</I> understand.  I don't know
why, but the books are lousy; UNIVERSALLY LOUSY!
</p><p>
Anyway, I'm <I>happy</I> with this book, because it's the first
example of applying arithmetic to science.  I'm a <I>bit</I> unhappy
when I read about the stars' temperatures, but I'm not very unhappy
because it's more or less right &ndash; it's just an example of error. 
Then comes the list of problems.  It says, "John and his father go
out to look at the stars.  John sees two blue stars and a red star. 
His father sees a green star, a violet star, and two yellow stars. 
What is the total temperature of the stars seen by John and his
father?" &ndash; and I would explode in horror.
</p><p>
My wife would talk about the volcano downstairs.  That's only an
example: it was <I>perpetually</I> like that.  Perpetual absurdity! 
There's no purpose whatsoever in adding the temperature of two
stars.   Nobody <I>ever</I> does that except, maybe, to then take
the <I>average</I> temperature of the stars, but <I>not</I> to find
out the <I>total</I> temperature of all the stars!  It was awful! 
All it was was a game to get you to add, and they didn't understand
what they were talking about.  It was like reading sentences with a
few typographical errors, and then suddenly a whole sentence is
written backwards.  The mathematics was like that.  Just hopeless!
</p><p>
Then I came to my first meeting.  The other members had given some
kind of ratings to some of the books, and they asked me what
<I>my</I> ratings were.  My rating was often different from theirs,
and they would ask, "Why did you rate that book low?"  I would say
the trouble with that book was this and this on page so-and-so &ndash; I
had my notes.
</p><p>
They discovered that I was kind of a goldmine: I would tell them, in
detail, what was good and bad in all the books; I had a reason for
every rating.
</p><p>
I would ask them why they had rated this book so high, and they
would say, "Let us hear what you thought about such and such a
book."  I would never find out why they rated anything the way they
did.  Instead, they kept asking me what <I>I</I> thought.
</p><p>
We came to a certain book, part of a set of three supplementary
books published by the same company, and they asked me what I
thought about it.
</p><p>
I said, "The book depository didn't send me that book, but the
other two were nice."
</p><p>
Someone tried repeating the question: "What do you think about that
book?"
</p><p>
"I said they didn't send me that one, so I don't have any judgment
on it."
</p><p>
The man from the book depository was there, and he said, "Excuse me;
I can explain that.  I didn't send it to you because that book
hadn't been completed yet.  There's a rule that you have to have
every entry in by a certain time, and the publisher was a few days
late with it.  So it was sent to us with just the covers, and it's
blank in between.  The company sent a note excusing themselves and
hoping they could have their set of three books considered, even
though the third one would be late."
</p><p>
It turned out that the blank book had a rating by some of the other
members!  They couldn't believe it was blank, because [the book] had
a rating.  In fact, the rating for the missing book was a little bit
higher than for the two others.  The fact that there was nothing in
the book had nothing to do with the rating.
</p><p>
I believe the reason for all this is that the system works this way:
When you give books all over the place to people, they're busy;
they're careless; they think, "Well, a lot of people are reading
this book, so it doesn't make any difference."  And they put in some
kind of number &ndash; <I>some</I> of them, at least; not all of them,
but <I>some</I> of them.  Then when you receive your reports, you
don't know <I>why</I> this particular book has fewer reports than
the other books &ndash; that is, perhaps one book has ten, and this one
only has six people reporting &ndash; so you average the rating of those
who reported; you don't average the ones who didn't report, so you
get a reasonable number.  This process of averaging all the time
misses the fact that there is absolutely nothing between the covers
of the book!
</p><p>
I made that theory up because I saw what happened in the curriculum
commission: For the blank book, only six out of the ten members were
reporting, whereas with the other books, eight or nine out of the
ten were reporting.  And when they averaged the six, they got as
good an average as when they averaged with eight or nine.  They were
very embarrassed to discover they were giving ratings to that book,
and it gave me a little bit more confidence.  It turned out the
other members of the committee had done a lot of work in giving out
the books and collecting reports, and had gone to sessions in which
the book publishers would <I>explain</I> the books before they read
them; I was the only guy on that commission who read all the books
and didn't get any information from the book publishers except what
was in the books themselves, the things that would ultimately go to
the schools.
</p><p>
This question of trying to figure out whether a book is good or bad
by looking at it carefully or by taking the reports of a lot of
people who looked at it carelessly is like this famous old problem:
Nobody was permitted to see the Emperor of China, and the question
was, What is the length of the Emperor of China's nose?  To find
out, you go all over the country asking people what they think the
length of the Emperor of China's nose is, and you <I>average</I> it. 
And that would be very "accurate" because you averaged so many
people.  But it's no way to find anything out; when you have a very
wide range of people who contribute without looking carefully at it,
you don't improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.
</p><p>
At first we weren't supposed to talk about the cost of the books. 
We were told how many books we could choose, so we designed a
program which used a lot of supplementary books, because all the new
textbooks had failures of one kind or another.  The most serious
failures were in the "new math" books: there were no applications;
not enough word problems.  There was no talk of selling stamps;
instead there was too much talk about commutation and abstract
things and not enough translation to situations in the world.  What
do you do: add, subtract, multiply, or divide?  So we suggested some
books which <I>had</I> some of that as supplementary &ndash; one or two
for each classroom &ndash; in addition to a textbook for each student. 
We had it all worked out to balance everything, after much
discussion.
</p><p>
When we took our recommendations to the Board of Education, they
told us they didn't have as much money as they had thought, so we'd
have to go over the whole thing and cut out this and that, . . . . 
When the senate budget committee got to it, the program was
emasculated still further.  Now it was <I>really</I> lousy!  I was
asked  to appear before the state senators when the issue was being
discussed, but I declined: By that time, having argued this stuff so
much, I was tired.  We had prepared our recommendations for the
Board of Education, and I figured it was <I>their</I> job to present
it to the state &ndash; which was <I>legally</I> right, but not
politically sound.  I shouldn't have given up so soon, but to have
worked so hard and discussed so much about all these books to make a
fairly balanced program, and then to have the whole thing scrapped
at the end &ndash; that was discouraging!  The whole thing was an
unnecessary effort that could have been turned around and done the
opposite way: <I>start</I> with the cost of the books, and buy what
you can afford.
</p><p>
What finally clinched it, and made me ultimately resign, was that
the following year we were going to discuss science books.  I
thought maybe the science would be different, so I looked at a few
of them.
</p><p>
The same thing happened: something would look good at first and then
turn out to be horrifying.  For example, there was a book that
started out with four pictures: first there was a windup toy; then
there was an automobile; then there was a boy riding a bicycle; then
there was something else.  And underneath each picture it said,
"What makes it go?"
</p><p>
I thought, "I know what it is: They're going to talk about
mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how
the engine of the automobile works; and biology, about how the
muscles work."
</p><p>
It was the kind of thing my father would have talked about: "What
makes it go?  Everything goes because the sun is shining."  And then
we would have fun discussing it:
</p><p>
"No, the toy goes because the spring is wound up," I would say. 
"How did the spring get wound up?" he would ask.
</p><p>
"I wound it up."
</p><p>
"And how did you get moving?"
</p><p>
"From eating."
</p><p>
"And food grows only because the sun is shining.  So it's because
the sun is shining that all these things are moving."  That would
get the concept across that motion is simply the
<I>transformation</I> of the sun's power.
</p><p>
I turned the page.  The answer was, for the wind-up toy, "Energy
makes it go."  And for the boy on the bicycle, "Energy makes it
go."  For everything, "<I>Energy</I> makes it go."
</p><p>
Now that doesn't <I>mean</I> anything.  Suppose it's "Wakalixes." 
That's the general principle: "Wakalixes makes it go."  There's no
knowledge coming in.  The child doesn't learn anything; it's just a
<I>word</I>!
</p><p>
What they should have done is to look at the wind-up toy, see that
there are springs inside, learn about springs, learn about wheels,
and never mind "energy."  Later on, when the children know something
about how the toy actually works, they can discuss the more general
principles of energy.
</p><p>
It's also not even true that "energy makes it go," because if it
stops, you could say, "energy makes it stop" just as well.  What
they're talking about is concentrated energy being transformed into
more dilute forms, which is a very subtle aspect of energy.  Energy
is neither increased nor decreased in these examples; it's just
changed from one form to another.  And when the things stop, the
energy is changed into heat, into general chaos.
</p><p>
But that's the way all the books were: They said things that were
useless, mixed-up, ambiguous, confusing, and partially incorrect. 
How anybody can learn science from these books, I don't know,
because it's not science.
</p><p>
So when I saw all these horrifying books with the same kind of
trouble as the math books had, I saw my volcano process starting
again.  Since I was exhausted from reading all the math books, and
discouraged from its all being a wasted effort, I couldn't face
another year of that, and had to resign.
</p><p>
Sometime later I heard that the energy-makes-it-go book was going to
be recommended by the curriculum commission to the Board of
Education, so I made one last effort.  At each meeting of the
commission the public was allowed to make comments, so I got up and
said why I thought the book was bad.
</p><p>
The man who replaced me on the commission said, "That book was
approved by sixty-five engineers at the Such-and-such Aircraft
Company!"
</p><p>
I didn't doubt that the company had some pretty good engineers, but
to take sixty-five engineers is to take a wide range of ability &ndash;
and to necessarily include some pretty poor guys!  It was once again
the problem of <I>averaging</I> the length of the emperor's nose, or
the ratings on a book with nothing between the covers. . . .
</p><p>
I couldn't get through to him, and the book was approved by the
board. . . .
</p>

<CENTER><H2>&#149;</H2></CENTER>

<p>
[During my time on the commission,] there were two books that we
were unable to come to a decision about after much discussion; they
were extremely close.  So we left it open to the Board of Education
to decide.  Since the board was now taking the cost into
consideration, and since the two books were so evenly matched, the
board decided to open the bids and take the lower one.
</p><p>
Then the question came up, "Will the schools be getting the books at
the regular time, or could they, perhaps, get them a little earlier,
in time for the coming term?"
</p><p>
One publisher's representative got up and said, "We are happy that
you accepted our bid; we can get it out in time for the next term."
</p><p>
A representative of the publisher that lost out was also there, and
he got up and said, "Since our bids were submitted based on the
later deadline, I think we should have a chance a bid again for the
earlier deadline, because we too can meet the earlier deadline."
</p><p>
Mr. Norris, the Pasadena lawyer on the board, asked the guy from the
other publisher, "And how much would it <I>cost</I> for us to get
your books at the earlier date?"
</p><p>
And he gave a number: It was <I>less</I>!
</p><p>
The first guy got up: "If <I>he</I> changes his bid, I have the
right to change <I>my</I> bid!" &ndash; and his bid is <I>still</I> less!
</p><p>
Norris asked, "Well how <I>is</I> that &ndash; we get the books earlier
and it's <I>cheaper</I>?"
</p><p>
"Yes," one guy says.  "We can use a special offset method we
wouldn't normally use . . ." &ndash; some excuse why it came out cheaper. 
The other guy agreed: "When you do it quicker, it costs less!"
</p><p>
That was really a shock.  It ended up <I>two million dollars</I>
cheaper.  Norris was really incensed by this sudden change.
</p><p>
What happened, of course, was that the uncertainty about the date
had opened the possibility that these guys could bid against each
other.  Normally, when books were supposed to be chosen without
taking the cost into consideration, there was no reason to lower the
price; the book publishers could put the prices at any place they
wanted to.  There was no advantage in competing by lowering the
price; the way you competed was to impress the members of the
curriculum commission.
</p><p>
By the way, whenever our commission had a meeting, there were book
publishers entertaining curriculum commission members by taking them
to lunch and talking to them about their books.  I never went.
</p><p>
It seems obvious now, but I didn't know what was happening the time
I got a package of dried fruit and whatnot delivered by Western
Union with a message that read, "From our family to yours, Happy
Thanksgiving &ndash; The Pamilios."
</p><p>
It was from a family I had never heard of in Long Beach, obviously
someone wanting to send this to his friend's family who got the name
and address wrong, so I thought I'd better straighten it out.  I
called up Western Union, got the telephone number of the people who
sent the stuff, and I called them.
</p><p>
"Hello, my name is Mr. Feynman.  I received a package . . ."
</p><p>
"Oh, hello, Mr. Feynman, this is Pete Pamilio" and he says it in
such a friendly way that I think I'm supposed to know who he is! 
I'm normally such a dunce that I can't remember who anyone is.
</p><p>
So I said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Pamilio, but I don't quite remember who
you are . . ."
</p><p>
It turned out he was a representative of one of the publishers
whose books I had to judge on the curriculum commission.
</p><p>
"I see.  But this could be misunderstood."
</p><p>
"It's only family to family."
</p><p>
"Yes, but I'm judging a book that you're publishing, and maybe
someone might misinterpret your kindness!"  I knew what was
happening, but I made it sound like I was a complete idiot.
</p><p>
Another thing like this happened when one of the publishers sent me
a leather briefcase with my name nicely written in gold on it.  I
gave them the same stuff: "I can't accept it; I'm judging some of
the books you're publishing.  I don't think you understand that!"
</p><p>
One commissioner, who had been there for the greatest length of
time, said, "I never accept the stuff; it makes me very upset.  But
it just goes on."
</p><p>
But I <I>really</I> missed one opportunity.  If I had only thought
fast enough, I could have had a <I>very</I> good time on that
commission.  I got to the hotel in San Francisco in the evening to
attend my very first meeting the next day, and I decided to go out
to wander in the town and eat something.  I came out of the
elevator, and sitting on a bench in the hotel lobby were two guys
who jumped up and said, "Good evening, Mr. Feynman.  Where are you
going?  Is there something we can show you in San Francisco?"  They
were from a publishing company, and I didn't want to have anything
to do with them.
</p><p>
"I'm going out to eat."
</p><p>
"We can take you out to dinner."
</p><p>
"No, I want to be alone."
</p><p>
"Well, whatever you want, we can help you."
</p><p>
I couldn't resist.  I said, "Well, I'm going out to get myself in
trouble."
</p><p>
"I think we can help you in <I>that,</I> too."
</p><p>
"No, I think I'll take care of that myself."  Then I thought, "What
an error!  I should have let <I>all</I> that stuff operate and [kept]
a diary, so the people of the state of California could find out how
far the publishers will go!". . . .
