Here is one possible letter you could use to invite new people to join CRV.
Good kinds of people to solicit:   activists, professional pollsters, CEOs,
people connected to or high inside political parties (both major and third parties),
politicians,  Iowans,  political and computer scientists,  journalists,  and
other related email-groups (en masse).

new "range voting" bulletin board - you invited

Hello.  This email is an invitation to join
the "range voting" email group and save the world.   

Range voting is an improved voting 
method related to "approval voting".  It will vastly 
improve those governments which adopt it.  The improvement is huge
and the cost is near zero.  Many defects of the US government will
be fixed immediately once range voting is adopted.
We are trying to organize a movement to, for example, cause the 
Iowa 2008 caucuses to be run by one or more major 
parties using Range Voting.

If you want to find out more about range voting, contribute to
the discussion, and help with the Iowa 2008 or related
political/lobbying efforts, then join our email group by pointing 
your browser to

   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting

and following the sign-up instructions.  
(Press "join this group!" or "new user? sign up")
Once you succeed in joining the group (you will not receive spam!)  
you then will receive a join-up message containing more information about how 
to do whatever you then want to do.  If you join the group you will receive
emails (e.g. a "daily digest" email, can also set it to "no email") 
from other posters in the group.
Also all posts will be available to all in a text-searchable archive
and please click "links" to get more info on a variety of topics.
If you wish to unsubscribe, that will also be easy (says how in 
join-up message).  

You can also help advertise the group and/or invite others to join
the group.  Please do! To make this a credible force that politicians
have to pay some attention to, we would like to get at least 1000 members.
This email group is the communication medium of the
"Center For Range Voting"

    http://math.temple.edu/~wds/crv/RangeVoting.html

founded by mathematician  Warren D. Smith.
You can also just join CRV directly (click "join") without
joining the email list.   
We are trying to get the Libertarian, Green, Constitutional, etc parties all
to endorse range voting.
