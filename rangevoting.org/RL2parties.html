<H2> <a href="http://www.robla.net">Rob Lanphier</a> on the evils of the USA's current 2-party system </H2>

<p>Right now many would lament the state of government and
leadership in our country. 
Trust in government is at an all-time low,
and voters feel as though they are no match for monied interests that
buy influence from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Many complain
about the &quot;horserace&quot; mentality in the media coverage of
elections, covering who is ahead  rather than the
issues. 
However, these problems are actually weaknesses in the <i>electoral system</i> we have today, 
and can be <i>fixed</i> by election reform.</p>

<H2> Strategy </H2>

<p>The reason why the media is so focused on the "horserace," i.e. the
relative positioning of the presidential candidates as the primary
season plays out all over the nation, is that it is information people
<i>need</i> to know. 
Why? 
Our election system forces people to engage
in "strategic voting." 
We are forced to pay attention to how <i>other</i>
people vote to determine the best way to cast <i>our</i> vote.</p>

<p>I should explain what I mean by "strategy."
Ideally, under a
strategy-free system, in a Presidential election, you would vote for
the one person you feel is best qualified to be President, bar
none.  In addition, there would be a mechanism by which you could
submit a list of all people you feel would be capable of
being President, in decreasing order. 
You wouldn't need to worry about how your neighbor
or the people in your state voted, in order to determine how to
cast your ballot. You just cast the ballot based on which candidate
represents you the best, and rank the rest from there in case
compromising is necessary.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our system is far from strategy-free. 
Rather than voting for the best candidate, we vote for
"the lesser of two evils" in order to keep things from getting any
worse.  
There is widespread cynicism about any successful candidate
for public office. 
It is widely assumed that anyone capable of
running a successful bid for the Presidency has to do quite a bit of
backroom dealing to pull it off, and so with a cynical resignation, we
vote for the one who won't screw things up <i>too</i> badly, in order to
avoid getting the candidate we fear the most.</p>

<p>Imagine if the steering wheel on your car only had two positions:
left and right, and that those two positions meant different things at
different times. 
That's what our two-party system is like. 
We are
steering our country with a two-position steering wheel, zig-zagging
back and forth on a reckless path.

<h2>Influence of Cash</h2>

<p>Because of voters bound by the strategy dilemma, candidates
realize that they have to convince people not only that they are
right, but that they can win. 
Voters don't like wasting votes, and so
candidates are forced to spend a lot of money on <i>proving they can win</i>
rather than <i>talking about the issues</i>. 
This illusion of winnability is expensive, and so only the candidates that gather a lot of
money up front stand a <a href="Tasini.html">chance</a>.</p>

<p>One of the quixotic ways in which we are trying to fight the battle
is to control the amount of money which candidates have to campaign with.
The idea is that if we cripple all candidates identically, then it will
be more fair for all of them. What really happens is that all candidates
are kept from competing with McDonald's, MTV, and Beverly Hills 90210 for
the mindshare of the people &ndash; which partially explains the widespread voter apathy
seen today.</p>

<h2>Change The Voting System 
<small>to reduce the strategy dilemma and hence the influence of cash</small>
</h2>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, strategy is <i>not</i> a necessary evil in
the system (at least not nearly at the level it exists today). 
Better voting systems exist.
</p>

<blockquote>
[Lanphier then expresses his current preference for Condorcet voting and 
<a href="PropRep.html">Proportional Representation</a> multiwinner
systems as improvements over winner-take-all plurality voting. He refers people to his
<a href="http://robla.net/1996/cpr/election-methods.html">election-methods email list</a> to observe
and/or participate in the ongoing debate.  We have omitted that part of his essay.]
</blockquote>

<p>Electoral reform isn't going to be the elixir that heals all.
People will still go hungry, crime will be everywhere, taxes will still be
too high, and the environment will still get trashed.  Nonetheless,
electoral reform is a solution that solves many of the problems that
campaign finance reform  <!-- dead link
<a href="http://www.dmregister.com/news/stories/c5917686/14166140.html">campaign finance reform</a> -->
purports to do. We should empower voters rather
than try to restrict our public servants and those that want to spend money
promoting politicians (which some people may support out of the goodness of
their hearts and the betterment of all (it happens!)). In the end, it will
result in more freedom for all of us.</p>

</p>
Hopefully, we can once again have leaders whom we trust.<p>

<small>
The theory about "cash" Lanphier advances above &ndash;
<ol>
<li>
with plurality voting cash automatically has a lot more importance than with better systems like
range voting
</li><li>
also (Lanphier did not emphasize) with 2-party domination voters have fewer choices, which also
causes cash to matter more relative to ideas (which matter less since there are fewer of them)
</li></ol>
is not just his theory; is
also is rather heavily supported by this book:
