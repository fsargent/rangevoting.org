<H2> Elections of Judges in the USA &ndash; how many voters have a clue? </H2>

<p>
John D. Fabian:
The paradox of elected judges: Tension in the American judicial system, 
<i>The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics</i> (Fall 2001)
reports a highly publicized judge election but still with only 18.6% turnout.
</p>

<p>
This is not unusual.  As far as we can tell, voter turnouts for US judicial elections
usually  range from 10% to 29%, and mostly 10-15%.
A <a href="whochooses.pdf">study of this (pdf)</a>
by <a href="http://www.seventy.org/">www.seventy.org</a>
claimed that 
approximately 13%
of Pennsylvania voters qualify as "judicial voters." They claimed that voters often try but
fail to get information on judges because there is a "dearth" of it. 
They claim
that the political party and geography were among the most important "factors" used
to decide on judges by members of "focus groups."
However, in many places, judges are (by law) <i>not</i> identified by party
affiliation exactly
to prevent robot-like party-line voting.
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally, this did not stop judges from collecting enormous campaign contributions,
largely from attorneys and those appearing before them in court, and including for judges
in <i>uncontested</i> "races,"
<a href="PA_elections.htm">say the AJS</a>.)
