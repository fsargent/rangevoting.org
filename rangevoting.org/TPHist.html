<H2> How long can third parties survive under plurality? </H2>

<p>(<a href="RangeVoting.html">Return to main page</a>)</p>
<p>
History shows:
US third parties all seem to reach their all-time peak within about
1-16 years after founding, then  
diminish.  Once they've fallen to about 5% of what they were at their peak, they die.
Their founders perhaps suffer from the delusion that
their idea, that new socio-politico-economo-religious-ecological idea 
that is special to their party, is so wonderful or
different that, maybe, just this once, that party will be able to overcome
<a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's law</a>
and win, or at least grow into a viable party.   
</p>

<p>
<img src="assets/images/FutileWeight.jpg" width="81" height="225" alt="Futile Weight" align="left">
And so, they foolishly choose once again
to concentrate on their wonderful idea and to ignore (or nearly so) the
idea of improving the voting system.
They don't understand that it just doesn't matter what their idea is.
No matter what it is, if one of the major parties gives some slight
lip service to that idea, say equivalent to just 2% of what the third party wants,
then even plurality
voters who like that third party best, are fully strategically justified 
mathematically/statistically in voting major-party, and in fact do so &ndash; in 
around a 10:1 ratio.   
Nothing can overcome that ratio.
And then  Duverger's law wins and they die like usual.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the <i>more</i> compelling and important their idea is, the <i>more</i>
justified voters are in voting major-party to try to make the major-party
that most-supports that idea win &ndash; as opposed to helping their
major-party opponents win by voting third-party.  The situation is rather like the weight
illustrated.  No matter how heavy you make the weight, it is not going to
pull itself up by means of the rope attached to the pulley.
You can try adding more weight, and oiling the pulley with your special new kind of oil,
and vibrating the weight, and whispering incantations to the weight, but those
measures just aren't going to work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Let's take a look back through history</b> at the most prominent US third parties.
Most have either gone the national route by trying to run for President, or
concentrated on local races.  The former was futile because they never could
come close to winning.  The latter, in contrast, could yield victories, but
also was futile because the whole raison d'etre of
these third parties were ideas only really applicable on a nationwide scale.

<center>POPULIST PARTY (aka PEOPLE's PARTY)</center>
<p>
The populists began with farmers hurt by falling food prices.
The fall was caused by greater mechanization and better railroad transport
which made markets more competitive, but the Populists refused to recognize that 
and instead blamed their problems on a vast vague money conspiracy, excessive
rail freight rates, etc. 
Later the farmers were joined by Western Silver Miners who wanted the USA to base its
monetary system on silver (not gold) and invented all sorts of irrational
theories about why that would cure all ills.
The populists were correct that there were plenty of problems with the banking
and currency system, and that there was plenty of big-money  corrupt influence
on US politics.  They reached their peak
in their first presidential run in 1892 when their
candidate James B. Weaver got
over a million popular votes (8.5%).  In 1896 they simply 
promoted the Democrats' presidential candidate
William Jennings Bryan, <i>but</i> ran a different vice president
(T.E.Watson) than the Democrats' choice (A.Sewall), creating much confusion and allowing
the Republican W.McKinley (supported heavily by the hated corrupting railroad plutocrats!)
an easy victory.  
They then diminished, e.g. with Watson collecting only 0.2% of the presidential votes in 1908;
and  after 1912 they were dead.

The Socialist party reached its peak of 6% in 1912.  It was essentially dead after
1950, although the Socialist Workers managed to get about 0.1% for Linda Jenness
in the 1972 and
Peter M. Camejo in the 1976
presidential elections.
(With the benefit of hindsight,
it seems hard to disagree that Debs would have been a better president than
Warren G. Harding in 1920.)
As far as I know Norman Thomas, the pallbearer for the dying corpse of
the Socialist Party, never advocated improving the voting system, despite the fact
that was the only possible way for the Socialists to have any chance.

(Founded 1912 by T.Roosevelt; after 1952 ceased to exist.)
The progressives apparently did not run presidential contenders except in the years shown,
but were able to re-awaken from their slumbers at times when an attractive candidate
came along &ndash; although they continuously went downhill.  (In 1912 and 1924 probably
the Progressive candidates were objectively the best ones running.)
Even at the party's <i>death-knell</i> 
in 1948, candidate H.A.Wallace in his long address accepting
his nomination did not even <i>mention</i> the idea of improving the voting system.

(Re the "0.1?":
In 2004, Nader ran in most states as an Independent and hence collected only a small  number of
his votes under the Reform Party flag.)
The reform party appears to be near death;
it has already split into several struggling remnants
each of which has microscopic funding compared to what it used to have.
The switch from supporting Buchanan to Nader was, to say the least, drastic.
Even at the party's <i>death-knell</i> 
in 2000, candidate P.Buchanan in 
his <a href="http://www.buchanan.org/pa-00-0812-speechnomination.html">long address</a> accepting
his nomination did not even <i>mention</i> the idea of improving the voting system.

This party changed its name from "taxpayers" to "constitution."  It seems
too early to say what will happen to it.  As one sobering possibility,
consider the fate of the  CITIZEN'S PARTY organized by 
environmental scientist Barry Commoner to support his 1980 presidential run.
Commoner got 
233,052/86,509,678=0.269% of the votes and then the Citizen's Party
promptly collapsed and vanished
from the scene.  (Note that this is a substantially larger vote &ndash; both as
a percentage and as a count &ndash; than the Taxpayers/Constitution party has ever gotten.)
As far as I know, neither Peroutka nor Commoner ever called for improving the voting system
by replacing plurality with something better.  E.g. in Peroutka's 
<a href="PeroutkaAccSpeech.html">acceptance speech</a> of his 2004 party nomination,
he never <i>mentioned</i> the idea &ndash; although he plainly was aware of the 
"lesser of two evils" strategic-voting phenomenon with plurality, he apparently thought 
that it would be overcome by righteous religious rage.
If that was Peroutka's thinking, he guessed very wrong.
Quote: 
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td>
<p>
[The American People]
are enraged by blatant attacks on the right of the people to acknowledge the God upon whom our nation was founded.
</p>

<p>
They don't want to waste their vote on the lesser of two evils anymore.  They have seen more than enough evidence of evil and corruption from both major parties to realize that it's just as wrong to vote for Gomorrah as it is to vote for the slightly more evil Sodom. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Remember the paradox of the weight and the pulley.  It will take more than religious
righteousness to make the Constitution party get ahead, Mr. Peroutka; all the
Christian righteousness in the world could push down on that weight, but still the pulley would
not pull it up.  Imagining so is just a logico-physical fallacy of the sort the Devil
loves to tempt us into by making us think what we <i>want</i> to think rather
than the <i>truth</i>.   You need
to support <i>range voting</i>.  
Righteousness can win, but only if given the <i>right tools</i>
to do  the job, not if it is forced to  use the <i>Devil's</i> tools.

The Libertarians still seem alive and kicking, but judging from history, presumably 
also are on a downward trajectory and anyhow even at their peak in 1980
never came close to any of the first three
parties we discussed.    Today's third parties are
dwarfs even compared to the third parties of the 1900s.
Can the Libertarians afford to sit around twiddling their thumbs focusing 
on things other 
than trying to change the voting system?  Probably not.  If we miss the Iowa '08
Range Voting opportunity, it quite likely will not recur for another 8 years: 2016.
Add 12 more years to this Libertarian trajectory and extrapolate yourself.
If the Libertarians <i>drown</i> in 2012,
it will be <i>too late</i>
because  <i>they waited too long</i> before making range voting
their top priority.
</p><blockquote>
<small><b>Later note (added 2018):</b>
I talked face to face twice with Bob Barr, 
Libertarian candidate for US president in 2008, slightly before he began
that run. I told Barr
he needed to make voting-system-reform be a main topic of
his presidential run.  Barr refused, and insisted he was an expert who knew far more
about political strategy than I, and that his strategy would win
him the presidency while mine would be a waste of time.
Specifically, Barr's strategy was to emphasize 
"politicization of the US justice department" as his main issue,
and ignore the whole issue of voting-system-reform.
I argued that actually, Barr would not come close to winning the
US presidency; and if he focused on voting system reform he could increase media
attention on that subject by maybe a factor of 10 &ndash;
whereas if he focused on 
politicization of the US justice department (which was already
getting plenty of
media coverage without any help from Barr) he'd increase that 
media by maybe 5%.  
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What was the result?  Well, amazingly enough, Barr's expert prediction
he would win the US presidency did not pan out, while my prediction
he would lose it by a huge margin, did.  And the Libertarians lost yet another
opportunity to advocate an issue that actually mattered for their own survival.
Indeed in retrospect most Libertarian party members now regard Barr as simply
having used their party 
<!-- similarly to the way Bernie Madoff used investor money &ndash; -->
to gain some nationwide fame to use as a tool to help him try later to resume his
political career as a non-Libertarian.

<i>Finally</i> in 2004, when the Greens (judging by their election result) appeared about to
die, Cobb and Badnarik both noted in their debates that they advocated 
"<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>."  Unfortunately,
IRV <a href="TarrIrv.html">still leads</a> 
to 2-party domination and hence would still not help US third parties
particularly.  
They need to advocate <i>range voting</i> which
is known to generate <a href="PsEl04.html">far more votes</a> for third parties.
(Later note; Badnarik and his Libertarian 2004 running mate Campagna now both
have endorsed Range Voting, as did 2004 Socialist US Presidential
candidate Walter Brown.)

Another valid idea was advocated in 2004 by Peter Camejo (then vice-presidential
candidate running with Ralph Nader; in 1976 Camejo had been the Socialist Workers
presidential candidate): <a href="HonestRunoff.html">runoff elections</a>.  
(That is, genuine runoffs, not "instant" pseudo-runoffs.)
Runoffs are used in France  &ndash; which has more than
two parties!  However, we consider this idea less good than range voting (and indeed
disparage <i>any</i> idea requiring extra elections).
