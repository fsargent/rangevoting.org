In this 100-voter 4-candidate election by Toby Pereira
(candidates named A,B,C,D)
the winner under IRV (instant runoff voting) is
<b>B</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
Round #1: A(30) - B(26) - C(24) - <b>D(20)</b> eliminated
<br>Round #2: <b>A(30)</b> eliminated - B(36) - C(34)
<br>Round #3: B(66) - <b>C(34)</b> eliminated
<br><b>Winner: B.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
However <b>A</b> seems a superior choice:
</p><p>
&bull;  &nbsp;
A is the winner under plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting, with 30 votes, beating B(26), C(24), and D(20).
</p><p>
&bull;  &nbsp;
More strongly, A gets the most top-rankings with 30, <i>and</i> 
the most {top &amp; second} with 80 (and hence A also is the "Bucklin winner"),
<i>and</i> the most {top &amp; second &amp; third} with 100.
I.e, no matter at what ranking you draw a "line,"
A enjoys the most rankings above that line (and the fewest below it).
</p><p>
&bull;  &nbsp;
Also A beats <i>every</i> rival pairwise by landslide supermajorities, e.g.
</P>
<blockquote>
<b>A beats B</b> 64-36 (meaning 66 voters rank A above B versus only 34 who rank B above A);
<b>A beats C</b> 66-34;
<b>A beats D</b> 80-20.
</blockquote>
<p>
Incidentally, Howard Dean
[Vermont Governor 1991-2003,
once the frontrunning USA presidential candidate in 2004,
chair of Democratic Party 2005-2009, founder of Democracy For America]
at the end of his
7 Oct. 2016 <a href="DeanOpEdNYT2016.html">op-ed</a> for the <i>New York Times</i>
claimed IRV was the "best [way] to uphold majority rule."  Sorry Howard:
If A beats every rival by landslide supermajorities, but IRV demands that A lose, then
IRV does <b><i>not</i> "uphold majority rule."</b>
</p><p>
&bull;  &nbsp;
A also wins under the Borda count system,
with score 210 versus B(158), C(148), and D(84).
</p><p>
&bull;  &nbsp;
Also A would win using <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> 
voting with top-ranked candidates getting score W,
second-ranked getting score X, 
third-ranked getting score Y,
and last-ranked getting score Z,
for <i>any</i> W&ge;X&ge;Y&ge;Z,
not all equal.
</p><p>
In this election, if S dropped out of the
race, then A would win, for S=B, or S=C (but not S=D).
In other words C is a "<b>spoiler</b>," meaning that 
by the act of running, C prevented A from winning, "spoiling" it for A.
(Don't ever let anybody tell you that Instant Runoff prevents the "spoiler effect."
For example Dean in that same op-ed falsely said
"major parties don't have to fear being 'spoiled'." 
Sorry: if A were a major party candidate,
then he'd be spoiled with IRV, so he <i>would</i> need to "fear" that.)
</p><p>
IRV also does not prevent "<b>wasted votes</b>" (no matter how many times 
somebody says it does, e.g. again Dean falsely implied this in his op-ed) &ndash;
as we see because the 24 votes for C were assuredly wasted
since they caused their most-hated candidate B to win.  
Those voters of course would have preferred A to
win &ndash; and they futilely said so in their votes &ndash; but the very act of them
voting caused A to lose &ndash; if they either had not voted or
if they had appropriately lied in their vote, then A would have won.
