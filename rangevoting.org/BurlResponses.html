<p>
The election was held 3 March 2009.
A press release immediately appeared from FairVote 
("a non-profit, non-partisan organization that advocates for fair elections")
signed by Rob Richie ("executive director")
declaring
"Burlington Holds Second Highly Successful Instant Runoff Voting Election."
It was  published verbatim by <i>Huffington Post</i> but unfortunately contained
the false claim
<blockquote>
The Burlington election was a model of clean, open debate without "spoiler" concerns.
</blockquote>
which was, of course, also promptly regurgitated verbatim
by, e.g. Krist Novoselic in <i>Seattle Weekly</i>, etc.
On 6 March,
<u>Some Analysis of the 2009 Burlington IRV Election</u>
by "Terry Bouricius, a former city councilor and state legislator from Vermont, and 
senior policy analyst for FairVote" appeared on the FairVote blog, extolling it as
having "gone off without a hitch" and lauding its wonderful success without mentioning
a single one of its numerous pathologies.
<a href="Burlington.html">Our analysis</a>
demonstrating that this election had suffered numerous pathologies
appeared on the internet on 14 March.  
It was also described 
in
<u>Burlington's 2009 Mayoral Election: Did IRV Fail The Voters?</u>
by Wes D. Hamilton in the 15 March <i>Green Mountain Daily</I>.
<!--

-->
That article over time received numerous "comments" by internet denizens, mainly
an IRV advocate named  Rama Schneider, who also goes by the name "Ramabahama."
On 17 March,
<u>Response to Faulty Analysis of Burlington IRV Election</u>
appeared on the FairVote blog, allegedly demonstrating our analysis "faulty."
<!--
http://www.fairvote.org/blog/2009/03/response-to-faulty-analysis-of-burlington-irv-election/

On 23 March the same venue sported
<u>More on Warren Smith's
and Anthony Gierzynski's flawed analysis</u>.
<!--

Still more criticism, mainly from the same players,
came in the 13 March <i>Vermont Daily Briefing</i>, 
<!--

-->
in FairVote web pages sometimes referred to by the attackers... and heaven knows where else.
</p>

<p>
As of the end of March, we feel it is time to try to <b>respond</b> to the attack-attempts.
Depressingly, 
it appears almost all
fall into the following categories (or some combination):
</P>
<a name="categs"></a>
<font color="red"><ol type="A">
<li><font color="black">
State something false &ndash; or something
which perhaps might be true, but it supported by zero evidence (and often seems dubious),
as a "fact."
</font>
</li><li><font color="black">
Redefine some word according to an unusual private definition.  Then say <i>we'd</I>
misunderstood
and it wasn't a problem at all.  (Of course, on <i>other</i> 
occasions, when it suits their purposes,
the same attackers employ the conventional definitions, apparently seeing no contradiction.)
</font>
</li><li><font color="black">
Try to create a smokescreen composed of red herrings.
</font>
</li><li><font color="black">
Attack some claim we did not make, acting as though we'd made it 
(or distort our findings/methods, then
attack those distorted versions).

-->
</font>
</li>
</ol></font>

<p>
Also, the attackers try to flood with large numbers of these, thus making the task
of refuting them all, become long. They hope nobody will want to read
all the refutations.  
We've tried to help the reader by providing a quick access index (above).
We now try to deal with many of the attacks on a case by case basis.  (We provide
handy <font color="red">ABCD</font> codes so the reader can tell which game-plan that 
attack employs; <font color="red">A</font> is most frequent.)

As usual, quotes by the FairVote head and "senior analysts" containing massively-false
propaganda claims will be listed occasionally with
green background, as a little humorous interlude, like this:

<p>
<b>1 Spoilage rate</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)
Bouricius(FairVote blog):
"[IRV] saw voters handle the system remarkably well, with 99.99% valid ballots."
Bouricius (Vermont Daily Briefing):
"99.99% of IRV ballots cast were valid."
Rob Richie (title of blog post by him):
"Instant runoff in Burlington: 99.99% valid ballots in mayoral race."
</p>
<p>
<b>Response:</b>
We greet this claim with mixed emotions.
On the one hand the March 2009 Burlington IRV election
did display an encouragingly and gratifyingly
low ballot-spoilage rate, contrary to IRV's
<a href="SPRates.html">usual</a> historical performance: 
IRV countries have historically had higher
spoilage rates than comparable non-IRV countries, and in
elections in which <i>both</i> IRV and non-IRV races were
present, the IRV races historically delivered dramatically higher spoilage rates.
<small>
(Actually, the latter seems still to have been the case here: in the November
2008 Burlington election
for US president, 9 out of 20957 ballots were "spoiled," 
and in the VT governor election 4 out of 20944,
for a combined spoilage rate of 0.03% in these two plurality-voting races.
Despite the far
greater turnout in the Governor and US President contests than in the Mayor contest,
this still was <b>6 times smaller spoilage rate</b>
than in the IRV contest reckoned <I>correctly</I>
as we do below.)
</small>
</p><p>
On the other hand, it is depressing how IRV propagandists like Bouricius, even 
in an instance like this of IRV <i>exceeding</i> expectations,
feel forced to exaggerate their case well beyond the truth.
(Or perhaps it was an innocent arithmetic or typographical error, 
with the exact same error made several times in several different 
sentences by at least two FairVote authors
in several different places. But considering 
Bouricius was a <i>founder</i> of an IRV-voting <i>company</i> that
featured the official counts top center on its corporate home page
it is then rather depressing and frightening
that he could not produce 
correct numbers.)
</p><p>
To explain the rudiments of arithmetic:
According to Burlington's final official count posted by their elections office and
posted by Bouricius's own vote-counting company, 
"there were 4 invalid ballots"
and "8980 valid ballots." 
We repeat, these are verbatim quotes from
Bouricius's own voting company's web page.
That'd be a 99.96% valid rate, not 99.99%.
Except it is worse than that &ndash; in addition to wrong arithmetic, they also employed
"creative accounting."  Before counting of the "8980 valid ballots" even began,
the counters placed 4 of them in the "exhausted pile" and ignored them for the entire election.
Those 4 officially "valid" ballots each co-ranked two candidates top, one of them
a write-in.
Given that, we
have some trouble seeing why those 4 ballots were officially described as "valid"; and
since they <i>were</i> valid, we have trouble seeing why they were not counted.
They would bring the valid rate down to 99.91%.
Also (which the official counts failed to mention!)
about a dozen voters 
gave only a 1st and 5th preference. 
Almost all of these were "Wright (1), Kiss (5)."
These were counted
as "Wright&gt;Kiss&gt;(all others)" which probably was not the intent of those voters.
They probably intended  "Wright&gt;(all others)&gt;Kiss."
[<small>Later note: Rob Richie contends in email to WDS: 
they "of course" were counted as "Wright&gt;(all others equally)."  
But if so, that still was
not the intent of the voters, indeed, it seems the <i>least</I> likely of these 3 
interpretations to be what was intended.  In any event, our original contention happens
to be correct because <i>in this election</i> Richie's contention and our contention happen
to be, under IRV counting rules, effectively equivalent.</small>]
If we regard "wrongly counted" ballots as "invalid" too,
then the genuine validity rate was actually about 99.8%.
</p><p>
In short, Bouricius &amp; Richie here exaggerated to make the problems appear
to be a factor of 20 smaller than they were.
Actually,
<a href="#recountify">more</a> examination reveals 
more problems so the exaggeration was more like a factor of 100.

<b>2 "Personal attacks"</b>(<font color="red">AC</font>) <b>&ndash;</b>
Bouricius/FairVote:
"The <a href="Burlington.html">analysis</a>
opens with a personal attack against me [Bouricius/FairVote]
as an individual, which is rather odd."
</p><p>
<b>Response.</b>
Actually, it is "rather odd" that simply quoting the group, and the individual,
most associated with making IRV in Burlington happen, and then refuting
those quotes with evidence, is taken as a "personal attack."    
(We suggest  TGB's true intent
here was to create a distracting "red herring.")
</p>
<p>
Here's another typical example of FairVote falsehoods/deception (the reader can judge for
herself whether by pointing this out we are making a "personal attack"):

Instant runoff voting has a long, tested history of use in all kinds of important elections
&ndash; from president of Ireland (Mary Robinson won there after being second on the first 
count in 1990), mayor of London (Ken Livingstone won as an independent after Labour 
Party insiders denied him the nomination), house of representatives in Australia (where 
a minimum of 4 candidates ran in every district in November 2007 because no one has to worry 
about splitting the vote, and every race was won with a majority) and a growing 
number of US elections. See www.fairvote.org/irv for more.

Non-monotonicity has no real-world consequences &ndash; it never affects how people vote, 
and almost never happens anyway. The Condorcet winner issue is one where you have to balance 
priorities. Do we really want a candidate with 6% of first choices to defeat two candidates who 
split the other 94% of the vote? An IRV backer says no... Certainly I think we're on solid 
ground with most people who would agree.

<p>
Let's dissect this quote.  (It's going to take a long time because so much is wrong with it.
<small><a href="#SummRichBogus">Skip to summary</a></small>)
First of all, while citing 
Mary Robinson's election in <a href="Ireland1990.html">Ireland 1990</a> as 
a poster-boy example of IRV success and telling us how
"non-monotonicity... almost never happens," Richie "forgets" to point out that
that very election exhibited a <a href="Ireland1990.html#hybrid">hybrid</a>
of non-monotonicity and no-show failure!   
(This election is actually quite an indictment of IRV in the following sense: in the entirety
of Irish history, this appears to have been the single IRV election in which 
IRV "made a difference" i.e. elected somebody who would not have won with plain plurality voting
&ndash; and in that one case, IRV exhibited pathologies!)
And while citing the 150 November 2007 
Australian IRV elections as another IRV "success" poster-boy, Richie "forgets" to mention
that at least 9 of those 150 <a href="Aus07.html">suffered</a>
either a no-show or a thwarted-majority pathology.  One shudders to imagine the IRV races
<i>not</i> cited by FairVote as "great successes."
</p>
<table bgcolor="#00ff88" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>
<blockquote>
"IRV's flaws, if they existed, would have showed up in the decades of
IRV elections in Australia and Ireland... But they don't."
&ndash;
FairVote head Rob Richie, letter published in <i>The Nation</i> June 2008.
</blockquote>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Also, Ken Livingstone's election was <i>not</i> Instant Runoff Voting according to FairVote's
own official definition of IRV: the London rules prescribed only 2 rounds, whereas FairVote
("How Instant Runoff Voting Works" page downloaded 25 March 2009) demands continuing
until some candidate "receives a majority"; FairVote IRV rules demand votes be a rank-ordering of
the candidates, but London only allowed 1 first and 1 second choice, nothing further 
permitted.  So we don't
exactly see why this election was part of the "long tested use" of IRV.
</p><p>
And Richie's claim that the reason for the large number of candidates in
these Australian IRV races was that "[with IRV] no one has to worry 
about splitting the vote" was deceptive. 
First deception:
as the present (<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a>)
election illustrates, vote-splitting-like phenomena still happen with IRV.  Specifically,
Wright's supporters preferred Montroll over Kiss by over a 3:1 ratio.  <i>Because</i>
they voted for Wright, IRV <i>ignored</i> their stated Montroll&gt;Kiss preferences, causing
Kiss to win.   This same Burlington election also illustrated vote-splitting 
in plain-plurality voting:  Montroll and Kiss supporters "split the vote" allowing
the lose-to-all loser Wright to win.   That is, the fact that the Kiss supporters
preferred Montroll&gt;Wright by over a 5:1 ratio was <i>ignored</i> by plain-plurality 
voting
(and also by IRV).
</p><p>
IRV propagandists like Richie generally
point out phenomena of the latter kind as an argument in favor of IRV and against plain-plurality.
Unfortunately they simultaneously
pretend (as they did here) that phenomena of the former kind (which make <i>IRV</I> look bad)
<i>do not exist</I>!
But they are both the same phenomenon, and indeed the IRV version is <i>worse</i> in a few senses:
<ol type="i">
<li>
IRV 
<i>solicited</I> the Montroll&gt;Kiss preferences of the Wright voters, giving them the deceptive
impression that their opinion about Montroll-vs-Kiss mattered.  IRV then ignored
all those opinions.  In contrast, with
plain plurality voting, the Kiss voters were <i>unable</i> to express
Montroll-vs-Wright preferences and hence there was no deception going on &ndash; they <i>knew</i>
there was no way their opinions on that would be counted.
</li><li>
IRV refused to count the dramatic
Montroll&gt;Kiss preferences of the Wright voters
and also refused to count the dramatic
Montroll&gt;Wright preferences of the Kiss voters.
However it was perfectly happy to count the (less dramatic)
Wright-vs-Kiss preferences of the Montroll voters!
That, rather arbitrarily, unfairly, and whimsically,
gave some voters more say than others. In contrast,
with plain plurality voting, all voters had the same say.
</li><li>
IRV also can exhibit pathologies that plurality voting cannot, such as non-monotonicity
(altering your vote to favor X makes X <i>lose</i>!) and no-show paradoxes
(<i>not</i> voting can yield a better winner than if you honestly vote!) 
and crazy-<a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal</a> paradoxes (voting for the 
candidate you <i>hate</i> the most, can actually be a better
strategic move than voting for the one you like the most!)
&ndash; all of
which occurred in the Burlington 2009 election.
</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Second deception:
the true reason Australian "third parties" are strong enough to run candidates
in all or most IRV races is <i>not</i> because IRV allows them to win &ndash; in fact in this very 
2007 election cycle Richie cites, <i>zero</I> third-party members won IRV seats,
same as in the preceding Australian
IRV election cycle. The true reason instead is that Australia <i>also</i> has
another body called the "senate" elected via a different voting system (proportional
representation, multiwinner elections) 
which <i>does</i> allow third-parties to win a decent number of (senate) seats.
</p>
<p>
The claim about monotonicity "almost never happening" is of course false,
refuted both by the very Burlington 2009 election here, as well as by
<a href="Monotone.html#summary">mathematics</a> which indicates it happens 5-15% of the time in 
3-way IRV races and 100% of the time in N-way races when N becomes large.
The claim that it "never affects how people vote" is remarkably strong.  We might
have been willing to accept "usually doesn't affect" but <i>never</i>? <i>Ever</i>? (All with zero
evidence presented for it?)  In any case, even if it really did never affect how anyone ever 
voted ever, then non-monotonicity still would remain a significant problem for IRV since
it still leads to wrong IRV election outcomes even with 100%-honest votes.  And this
judgment of "wrongness" is not a subjective one.  We <i>know</i> since IRV contradicts 
<i>itself</I> that at least half of IRV nonmonotone elections deliver wrong winners.
</p>
<p>
Richie's ploy about "the Condorcet winner issue" has some validity but
is not relevant to Burlington 2009.
Richie worries that a candidate with 6% of first choices might be a Condorcet ("beats all")
winner, and
in such a circumstance doubts the legitimacy of electing him.  
We <a href="FishburnAntiC.html">agree</a>
that there can be 
<a href="CondCoursera.html">grounds</a>
for questioning the legitimacy of "weak" Condorcet winners.
However, in the Burlington 2009 election, Montroll was not a weak Condorcet winner,
he was a strong one.  Specifically, Montroll beat <i>every</I> rival and did so
by pairwise margins in <i>every</I> case over twice as great as the margin 
(trumpeted by Richie, FairVote, and Bouricius)
justifying Kiss's IRV victory over Wright.   It is very rare that there are
good grounds for questioning the legitimacy of the victory of a "strong" Condorcet winner such
as Montroll in Burlington.
(In fact, as of 2009 no such case has ever been brought to our attention in all of world history.)
</p><p>
Finally, we'll address Richie's final false sentence <a href="#rv">below</a> &ndash; albeit it
is even more false here since Richie uses the extremely strong word 
&quot;<a href="Consensus.html">anything</a>.&quot;
</p>
<A name="SummRichBogus"></a>
<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
When you look at this (a typical web post by Richie/FairVote) 
it is absolutely astonishing what a large
percentage of it 
consists of lies, misleading half-truths, and attempts to trick the reader.
If IRV is so wonderful, wouldn't the truth suffice?  Couldn't its proponents
achieve, say, at least 80% genuine-truth levels?  I mean, even Adolf Hitler 
and Bernie Madoff probably managed <i>that</i>.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="bias"></a>
<p>
<b>3 Bias/"unethical" nonDisclosures</b>(<font color="red">C</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius's next red herring was to accuse professor Anthony Gierzynski of
"anti-IRV-bias" because 
"in 2002 he... ran for state legislature as a Democrat against incumbent state legislator,
the Progressive Party's Bob Kiss,
who later went on to be the winner in Burlington's two IRV elections for mayor.
Professor Gierzynski does not disclose this obvious source of potential bias..."
</p><p>
So the idea here is apparently that Gierzynski must have held
a 7-year-long grudge against 
Kiss for having defeated him in a (non-IRV, indeed not even single-winner, indeed IRV
had not even been introduced anywhere in Vermont at that time) race 
(the one time A.G. ran for office),
and therefore became biased
against IRV (instant runoff voting) in a mayoral race Gierzynski was uninvolved in
7 years later. 
</p><p>
Oh.
</p><p>
Here's our suggestion to Bouricius about ethics: 
if you co-found a IRV-voting company
and you received contracts from Burlington &ndash;
then disclose <i>that</i> when posing as a 
an objective unaffiliated "voting reformer" from "FairVote" who 
has no skin in the game.
</p><p>
Oh, and while we are at it,
<i>Bouricius</i> "forgot to disclose" that <i>he</i>
was a member of the Vermont legislature as a "Progressive"
and so was Kiss (both from North Burlington).  
Bouricius also was involved in a scandal
when the <i>Rutland Herald</I> in May 1995 revealed he and other-Burlington-rep Dean Corren were
collecting $1600/month in "overnight lodging expenses" so they could stay in Montpelier
for their legislative duties.   They'd "forgotten to disclose" that they had rented
an apartment 1 block from the state house for only $340/month.
</p><p>
Which of these "ethical flaws" do you consider more serious?  
</p>
<hr>
<a name="mono1"></a>
<p>
<b>4 Monotonicity</b>(<font color="red">ABC</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
Bouricius/FairVote:
The [analysis] incorrectly states that Burlington's  IRV election suffered 
from a monotonicity failure...
In fact, no such failure occurred.
What his analysis actually shows is that non-monotonicity 
<i>could</i> have affected the election, but did not. 
<i>If</i> just over 25% of the supporters of Republican Wright had abandoned their 
true first choice... But this did not happen, and there is nobody who thinks it 
was a sensible strategy for any voters or candidates to advocate.
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
Sadly, Bouricius does not understand the <a href="Monotone.html">definition</a>
of "monotonicity"
(and appears to be trying to invent his own private definition just for the present
occasion).
Indeed, Bouricius misunderstands the whole point of monotonicity.
Monotonicity is not about one election, it is about <i>two</I> elections &ndash;
one before, and one after, votes are altered in a manner favoring X.   If
those vote-alterations cause X to <i>stop</I> winning, 
then
<ol type="a">
<li>
That is a monotonicity failure,
</li><li>
We can be 100% certain that at least one of the
two elections delivered the wrong winner.
</li></ol>
Bouricius desperately plays "3-card Monte"
to try to confuse the reader ("That second election didn't really happen!" &ndash; of course not) 
and attempts
to throw up a smoke screen of irrelevant red herrings 
("That vote-alteration would have seemed to be a dangerous strategy!" &ndash; so what? 
The nonmonotonicity definition does not even <i>mention</I> the words "strategy" or "danger").  
This 
of course will not fool anybody who actually thinks about it &ndash;
but we doubt Bouricius
was focused on that class of readers.
</p><p>
Oddly enough, <a href="Monotone.html">our</a>
definition happens to coincide remarkably precisely with the one on page 3 of
Jonathan K. Hodge &amp; Richard E. Klima:
<i>The Mathematics of Voting and Elections</i>,
American Math'l Society 2005, and also with those in the undergraduate textbook
Peter Tannenbaum: <i>Excursions in Modern Mathematics (Fifth Edition)</i>,
Peason Education 2004,
the <i>Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare</i> (Elsevier 2002),
etc. <!--
and International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (9 vols) 
Macmillan Reference USA 2008. -->
</p><p>
Interestingly, Bouricius
actually <a href="FairVoteMonotonicityPage.html">links</a> 
to a FairVote page giving the following definition of 
monotonicity, and then providing an example of a non-monotonic IRV election
under FairVote's own definition, 
which actually does <i>exactly the same thing</i> as the Burlington 2009 election!
FairVote had neglected to point out, at the time they wrote that definition and example,
that (according to Bouricius) their own example election was (according to FairVote's 2009
claims) really <i>not</i> an example of
nonmonotonicity.  Oops.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Monotonicity can be defined as follows:</b> A candidate X should not be harmed (i.e, 
change from being a winner to a loser) if X is raised on some ballots without 
changing the relative orders of the other candidates.  &ndash; FairVote's own definition
on one of their web
pages, downloaded 23 March 2009.

<p>
[Note: this is exactly what failed in Burlington 2009 with X=Kiss.]
<br>
The very FairVote
page Bouricius links to as his source continues by providing this <i>example</i> of a 
non-monotonic IRV election:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Andrea wins this IRV election:
#ballots 1stChoice 2ndChoice
  39      Andrea    Belinda
  35      Belinda   Cynthia
  26      Cynthia   Andrea
</pre>
but after a hypothetical change of 10 Belinda votes to now raise Andrea from last to first rank, 
Cynthia  would win.
</blockquote>
<p>
Note, this example exactly parallels what happened in Burlington 2009 if we rename
Andrea&rarr;Kiss, Belinda&rarr;Wright, Cynthia&rarr;Montroll. 
Specifically, Kiss won, but after a hypothetical change of 753 Wright votes
to now raise Kiss to first rank, Montroll would win.
(Hodge &amp; Klima also
give an example on p.49 also of the same sort.)

<p>
<b>7 Spoilers</b>(<font color="red">D</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
Smith and Gierzynski assert that the Burlington election suffered from a "spoiler"
scenario. In order to make this claim they need to stretch the usual understanding of the term
"spoiler" to fit the data.
Normally, the term "spoiler"
refers to a candidate who receives relatively few votes...
I have never seen the term "spoiler" applied to a front-runner
"spoiling" the chances of a candidate in third place before. [This stretch]
 suggests the term could also be stretched so that the actual winner, Bob Kiss
"spoiled" the possible election of the third place finisher Andy Montroll, who would have won
if Kiss hadn't run...
The simple fact is that no candidate was considered a "spoiler" by
[either]  the media or the voters.
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
We had given a link to our definition of spoiler:
<a name="#spdefn"></a>
<blockquote>
A "spoiler" is a candidate S, such that, if you vote for S, that could cause both S 
and your second-favorite candidate Q both to lose, whereas if you had voted for Q 
(e.g. if S were to drop out of the race, or if you just voted dishonestly to strategically 
pretend Q was your true favorite), then Q would have won. Spoilers can exist in Plurality, 
IRV, Borda, and Condorcet voting but do not exist in Approval and Range voting.
</blockquote>
Note that under this definition, Kiss was <i>not</i> a spoiler in this IRV election.
Bouricius/FairVote here are
using technique "D": accuse us of saying the opposite of what we said,
then attack <i>that</i>.
</p><p>
There <i>was</I>, however, justification for them claiming that "spoiler"
normally refers to a candidate with "little or no chance of winning" [Merriam-Webster 
dictionary] whereas, our definition
does not involve S's winning chances (good or bad) at all.  We consider our
definition to be superior to Merriam-Webster's 
because it is <i>mathematically acceptable</I> 
(i.e, precisely defined, without
need to make subjective judgments about the "poorness" of "winning chances" &ndash;
only this type of definition is acceptable in a mathematical paper and in cases such as this,
Webster dictionary definitions are not
&ndash; e.g, to illustrate the problems, Wright's
winning chances under IRV here were actually mathematically 
<i>zero</i> since he both lost 
the election and
was defeated pairwise by both K and M) 
and also because it happens
to coincide better with what <i>matters to humanity</i>.   
Specifically, it <i>matters</i> if
voting for S causes both S and your second choice <i>both</i> to lose.  That's a serious flaw.
The fact that S might have seemed to have "good chances of winning" himself does not
at all diminish how distressing this kind of pathology is.  Indeed, if anything,
it seems to us to make it <i>more</i> important.
</p><p>
The difficulty with claiming we invented our definition to "fit the data" is that this definition
had been <a href="Glossary.html#spoiler">sitting there</a> 
in our
<a href="Glossary.html">glossary</a> 
for years prior to the Burlington 2009
election.
</p><p>
The statement that "neither the media nor the voters" considered Wright a spoiler
is amazing in its gall.  The media also did not mention (that we noticed)
the non-monotonicity of this election.  Or the fact Montroll beat all rivals by majority
preference-counts.  (Well, actually, the media <i>did</i> mention all of
these things, e.g. in the <i>Green Mountain Daily</i> piece.
But we're going along with the FairVote policy of only counting
<i>their</I> media pieces.)
Essentially, Bouricius/FairVote here are declaring "we managed
by virtue
of our propaganda campaign that everything about this election was hunky-dory,
to stop the media we like from mentioning X.  Therefore,
that proves X did not happen!"
</p><p>
As a final remark, we note that although historically, those branded
"spoilers" in the USA have generally been third-party candidates, Burlington Vermont
is a rather exceptionally left-wing place since
64% of its voters were registered as Democrats and it has a 
long recent history of winners from the Progressive Party, including Kiss himself.
(Obama beat McCain by a thumping 17252-to-3086 margin in Burlington 2008.)
This caused the
Republican Wright arguably to <i>be</i> the "third-party" candidate, while
the Democrat Montroll
arguably was the "centrist."

It would be great if this claim (offered, just like now,
without any evidence or proof whatever)
had been true, but unfortunately (as was shown by this very

insincere rank ordering can be better IRV strategy than sincere
ranking.   This false claim was actually in direct contradiction to one of the most famous 
theorems about rank-order 
voting, the <a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>, a fact
self-proclaimed "political scientist" Bouricius failed to mention.  
(This error was comparable, in the voting field, to a proclamation that

<p>
<b>9 "No-show paradox"</b>(<font color="red">CD</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
Another supposed paradox that Warren Smith and Anthony Gierzynski claim occurred in the 
Burlington IRV election is the "no-show" or
participation paradox. <font color="red">This is the claim that some of Kurt Wright's
voters would have had a better outcome [in their view]
if some of them had simply stayed home and not 
voted at all</font>... 
However, using the actual rankings on the ballots shows that this is not the case in the 
Burlington election...
The authors "cooked" the data [to]
assert that this paradox did occur. 
What they do is assign preferences to voters that the voters themselves did not 
indicate on their ballots. To be clear, they do not use the actual ballot data, but 
instead made-up ballot ranking data to manufacture the paradox they apparently so wish 
had occurred in the Burlington election.
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
Our so-called "cooking" of the data (which we of course had fully explained up-front)
consisted in
assuming that those Wright voters who had voted for W without expressing a preference
between M &amp; K, actually either preferred K slightly over M or 
preferred M slightly over K (or some mixture), even though they did not say so in their votes.
</p>
<p>
There were 2008 W voters who <i>did</I> express a preference between M and K in their vote;
they preferred M over K by over a 3-to-1 ratio.
The problem is that there also were 1289 W voters who did <i>not</i> express any preference 
between M and K.   The Burlington election rules (unlike most Australian IRV rules) allowed
voters thus to "truncate" their ballots.  
Now of course, it is inconceivable that all these 1289 voters really absolutely did
not care by even the tiniest jot who won among M or K.   
If one were asked to state how much K's election was worth to her in dollars,
and stated $23.574321...  (and so on for an infinite number of decimal places)
it is of course ludicrous to assume that M's election would also have been worth exactly
$23.574321... to her also (and agreeing <i>exactly</i> for ever and ever
no matter how many decimal places they used).
</p><p>
The <i>truth</i> is those voters simply did not care <i>enough</i>
to express a preference in their vote, or perhaps were <i>ignorant</I> on the matter of
comparing Kiss versus Montroll (but, 
after gaining knowledge, would have preferred one or the other by some slight amount).
It seems reasonable to assume that these 1289 W voters would, <i>if</i> they had been required
as in Australia to state their full preferences, have behaved similarly to the other
2008 W-voters and thus favored M by a 3:1 ratio.   
Or one could instead postulate that these 1289 would instead  have had
coin-flips as preferences, preferring M and K equally often.  Those two hypotheses
both would be defensible.
One even (if one wanted to take an indefensible and peculiar stance) 
could postulate that these 1289 would
have been extremely <i>unlike</i> the other 2008 W-voters and actually would 
have preferred <i>K</i> by a 3:1 ratio!
We do not care which of these 3 postulates you assume (or anything in between)
&ndash; <i>whichever</i> one you pick,
you find that there existed at least 753
W-voters who preferred M over K.   
</p><p>
So we do not consider this 753-voter existence claim to be an outrageous stretch or a "cook."
On the contrary, anybody asserting the <i>contrary</I>, is outrageously stretching.
</p><p>
So let us take it as agreed that 753 W-voters who preferred M&gt;K exist.
</p><p>
In that case, those 753 voters were better off staying home and not voting
&ndash; "no-show paradox."
It would have made a candidate they preferred over Kiss win. 
That is simply, like 2+2=4,  a fact.  
</p><p>
And note <i>it does not matter</I> whether they expressed these preferences in their vote, 
nor how tiny some of those preferences might be, nor does it matter
whether those voters would need to do further research before becoming sure
of these preferences.
<i>Regardless</i> of that, 2+2=4 still is true, 
i.e, those voters were better off staying home and not voting, thus
meeting the definition of "no-show paradox."  (In fact, meeting the <i>exact</I> 
<font color="red">wording</font>
given by the attacker <i>in his quote</i> above.)
Further, even if the 1289 W voters
actually truly did regard K &amp; M as <i>exactly</I> equal, then
the no-show paradox still happened
in the weaker sense that those 753 voters <i>as a group</i> were better off staying home;
each one would have got either a better or equal election result.
</p><p>
In short: if FairVote wishes to claim a no-show paradox did <i>not</i> occur then <i>they</i>
are assuming that the "silent" Wright voters must have preferred Kiss over Montroll by about
a 4:1 (or greater) ratio.  It is <I>that</i> which is an outrageous stretch and cook of
the data.   
</p><p>
We'd classify this attack as a desperate attempt to create a red herring, i.e method
C; the idea
was to create fear, uncertainty,
and doubt that we might be nasty data-cookers, but while keeping
the actual details carefully concealed to prevent resolution 
of that uncertainty, and to prevent the realization
that FairVote (or anybody denying the presence of the pathology)
were the ones <i>really</I> cooking the data.

<b>10 "Later-no-harm"</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
I and many other experts feel the... "later-no-harm"
[criterion is] far more important.
Unlike IRV, these methods [Range, Approval, and Bucklin voting]
violate "later-no-harm" and thus create a clear incentive... for "bullet voting"
(ranking only a first choice).
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
The "later-no-harm" criterion is a silly one
left unmentioned in most
books about voting methods because of its lack of importance.
Meanwhile every book on voting methods mentions the "far less important" Condorcet criterion.
"Later-no-harm" (LNH) demands that, if a voter ranks some candidate X as a less-favored choice
(as opposed to not ranking X at all)
that should not be able to hurt any of her more-favored choices.
(IRV satisfies LNH.)
The point of LNH is supposed to be that a voter will thus have no incentive to
leave candidates unranked &ndash; it encourages voters to provide more information.
</p><p>
That sounds initially like a good idea, until you realize that:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
LNH is actually the 
<i>wrong</I> criterion for addressing that point!
The right test is that a voter, by ranking X, should not be able to hurt <i>herself</I>
(i.e. cause the winner of the election to, in her view, worsen).   
IRV does not satisfy <i>that</I> criterion and hence IRV voters unfortunately
<i>can</i> be incentivized to
fail to rank candidates (since ranking them would make the winner worse).
Why should we care about IRV satisfying the fake test when it fails the correct test?
</li><li>
And it should be noted that this fake test was carefully worded to ensure that IRV
was almost the only nontrivial voting method satisfying it.   There are many possible
fake tests resembling, but not precisely the same as, the correct test.   IRV propagandists
generally choose this precise wrong choice of the test, from among all the possible 
wrong-wording
choices, to make IRV look good.
</li><li>
The whole point behind LNH anyhow is <i>irrelevant</I> and of no importance whatever
if (as in Australia, the most experienced IRV-using country) the rules simply 
<i>demand</i> that voters <i>must</i> provide full rank-orderings.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Oops. 
</p><p>
Here's another deceptive FairVote quote about LNH:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#00ff88" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>
<blockquote>
"For example, under Range and Approval voting, giving any support to a second choice may cause that voter's first choice to lose (violation of the Later-No-Harm Criterion), causing some voters to strategically truncate their true preferences. IRV complies with the Later-No-Harm Criterion, and is thus immune to such strategic calculation."
&ndash;
FairVote web page "IRV Myths and Facts (FAQ)" downloaded 25 March 2009.
</blockquote>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
FairVote actually (very carefully)
phrased the second quote to be technically true, but maximally misleading.  
(It is kind of a work of art.)
With IRV, truncating your preferences <i>can</i> be strategically 
better for you (i.e. result in a better winner in your view)
than honestly providing a full rank ordering.  Indeed, as we saw
in this very Burlington 2009 election, 
<i>full</I> "truncation" &ndash; i.e. not voting <i>at all</I> &ndash;
can be better for you than providing a full honest-ordering vote!  
The intent of this FairVote quote was to mislead
readers into believing that since IRV satisfies the
so-called "later-no-harm" condition, voters
never have incentive to truncate their IRV vote.   That's false.  
Indeed, the American Mathematical
Society (perhaps fooled by FairVote propaganda on this point!?) used to hold its
own elections using IRV and issued a statement <i>on their ballots</i>
saying that a voter could not obtain strategic benefit by
ranking fewer than all the candidates.
They then were embarrassed by an article 
</p>
<blockquote><small>
S.J.Brams &amp; P.C.Fishburn:
<i>The AMS nomination procedure is vulnerable to truncation of preferences,
</i>
Notices of the American Mathematical Society 29 (1982) 136-138.

giving a simple election counterexample!
Soon afterwards the AMS dropped Instant Runoff Voting and switched to 
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> Voting.
</p>
<a name="rvlnh"></a>
<p>
With <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, 
giving "support" (i.e. a score above 0) to your 2nd choice could indeed cause
that 2nd choice to defeat your first choice.  That's bad, and that's why range voting
violates LNH.  
<i>But</i> on the other hand, it also could
cause your 2nd choice to defeat your 3rd or 4th or 5th (etc) choices. That's good.
In view of this, would you be incentivized to give your 
second choice a score above zero?  Bouricius thinks you'd refuse,
but actually the correct answer is "usually."
You the (range)voter have to make that 
judgment on a case-by-case basis each time you vote.
</p><p>
<b>Example:</b>
<ol><li>
In the USA 2000 presidential election, suppose your honest preferences were
"Nader&gt;Gore&gt;Browne&gt;Bush."
Would it have been strategic for you to "bullet vote," scoring Nader, and Nader alone, above
zero?  Or would it have been more strategic also to award Gore a positive score (maybe
even the same score as Nader)? 
...<a href="Flor2000Res.html">Clearly</a>, the latter.  
The former kind of vote would have (and did) make
both Gore &amp; Nader lose;
only 600 votes of the latter kind would have made Gore win.
</li><li>
Suppose instead you preferred
"Gore&gt;Nader&gt;Browne&gt;Bush."
Would you have refused to give Nader 
a positive score because of the horrible fear that Nader might defeat Gore?
</li><li>
Suppose instead you preferred
"Bush&gt;Gore&gt;Browne&gt;Nader."
Would you have, with IRV, given this vote (because you realized that, thanks to IRV's later-no-harm
property, ranking Gore 2nd in this way would not hurt your favorite Bush) &ndash;
or would you have "played it safe" and dishonestly voted Gore bottommost?
<br>
In Australian IRV elections, it is <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">fact</a>
that about 95% of IRV voters 
simultaneously rank one major party top
and the other bottom or 2nd-bottom in a 7-party field, even though (based on seat-count) 
they are by far the two most popular parties in Australia. 
Indeed, the major parties themselves <i>advise</I> this dishonest strategy
(even though they undoubtably have voting-methods
experts advising them, computers, etc)!
</li></ol>

Many <a href="RangePolls.html">studies</a> have been conducted of real-world 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voters.
Did they usually refuse to score anybody besides their first choice?  Well, no.  That wasn't what
happened.  Indeed, in <i>every</i> range voting and approval voting study there,
they scored other choices a lot <i>more</i> frequently than these
Burlington 2009
IRV voters did!
</p><p>
So it would seem a clear
known fact, based on absolutely massive real-world evidence, that
LNH makes little or no difference to real-world IRV voter behavior, and
also that with range voting (despite its violation of LNH) voters  
usually score lots of candidates.
</p><p>
In view of this real-world evidence undermining LNH's whole point, 
the Bouricius stance that "later-no-harm" is 
"far more important"
is revealed to be completely ludicrous.  It has very little importance either practically
or theoretically.
The whole later-no-harm criterion seems to have been invented specifically to make IRV look good 
(IRV is almost the only method satisfying it) and it's exceedingly rarely (or
never) mentioned by authors who are
just comparing non-IRV voting methods.

<p>
<b>11 Mutual-Majority</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
I and many other experts feel the "mutual-majority" and "later-no-harm"
criteria are far more important than the Condorcet criterion, for example.
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
We addressed "later-no-harm" last response, now we address FairVote's
other "far more important"
criterion, "mutual-majority" (MM).
We can easily explain why Bouricius is <i>wrong</i> that MM is
"far more important" than Condorcet by using the present Burlington 2009 election as
an exhibit:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A 4573-to-2998 voter-majority said they preferred MONTROLL versus Smith (margin=1575).
</li><li>
A 4067-3478 majority preferred MONTROLL vs. Kiss (margin=589).
</li><li>
A 6267-591 majority preferred MONTROLL vs. Simpson (margin=5676).
</li><li>
A 4597-3668 majority preferred MONTROLL vs. Wright (margin=929).
</li><li>
A 6658-104 majority preferred MONTROLL vs. all write-ins combined (margin=6554).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In view of that, IRV, which obeys the MM criterion, elected KISS.
But any method obeying either the Condorcet or "Smith set"
criteria would have elected MONTROLL because of
his majority-defeat of every rival.   Note that, although majorities favored
Montroll over every opponent, they were not always the <I>same</i> majority set of voters.
The voter-sets who did it may have differed from rival to rival, 
but for any particular rival X,
in net, more voters preferred Montroll&gt;X, than X&gt;Montroll.
</p><p>
The MM criterion says that if a candidate (e.g. Montroll)
is preferred over every rival not just by a voter-majority, but by the <i>exact same</I>
voter-majority-set for each rival, <i>then</i> Montroll should win.
Plainly, that is going to happen much less often.   So this MM criterion
is strictly <i>weaker</i> than the Condorcet criterion (and its set-version is strictly weaker
than the Smith-set criterion).   
That makes MM <i>less</i> important, not "far more important."  Indeed, it could be argued that
it makes it so much less important, that it is almost silly.
</p><p>
Also, one has to ask (philosophically speaking) why it is that we should devalue
majorities with diverse opinions, versus majorities composed of
mindless cloned robots.   Some would argue that consensus &ndash;
agreement
among diverse factions &ndash;
is <i>good</i> and our voting system should not be artificially biased against it.
In that sense obeying MM (but not Condorcet) arguably is <i>un</i>desirable.
A probably-related <a href="IrvExtreme.html">effect</a>
is that IRV is strongly artificially biased against "centrists" (e.g. Montroll, here)
and in favor of "extremists."
</p><p>
All that is presumably why most books on voting  do not even mention MM, but all of
them discuss the "far less important" Condorcet criterion.

<p>
<b>Sanity check:</b>
Although the "political scientist" Bouricius and his unnamed "many experts" think
MM and LNH "far more important" than Condorcet... strangely, a

A cynic would argue <!--(probably correctly),-->
that the sole reason for FairVote &amp; Bouricius's emphasis on MM is
because it, like "later-no-harm," is one of the few criteria that IRV obeys while a lot of
other voting systems do not.  Also, Bouricius gains the benefit of 
sounding mysterious and impressively-expert-like by
intoning "mutual-majority criterion" (whether he knows what he is talking about, or not).

<b>12 Range Voting</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
"Since Range Voting has never been used for any governmental elections it is hard to be 
certain how often various paradoxes and pathological outcomes would occur. 
But it certainly is subject to genuine spoiler scenarios..."
(See also <a href="#RichieBogus">Richie</a> on this.)
<!--???MORE??? Approval???-->
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
Range voting has been used for <a href="OlympHist.html">many</a>
governmental elections, apparently highly successfully, dating back to the dawn of democracy.
Indeed, it had already been used (for 
much longer than IRV has <i>ever</i> been used)
even back at the time IRV got <i>invented</i>!  
</p><p>
At least with our definition 
(<a href="#spdefn">above</a>) of spoiler,
range voting <i>never</I> exhibits a spoiler 
(unlike, as the Burlington election showed, IRV).  
That is, it is impossible in range voting, by
giving S the maximum score, to cause both S and your 2nd choice Q both to lose.
That's because the decision about how to score Q (or anybody else) is an independent decision,
unaffected by how you score S; and raising their score
can never hurt a candidate's winning chances
with range voting (unlike IRV, as the Burlington election showed).
<i>Theorems</i> like this enable us to be "certain" that range voting <i>never</i> exhibits certain
kinds of pathologies.  
</p><p>
Notice the contrasting meanings of the word "never." 
When mathematicians employ "never" it means never.
When Bouricius and FairVote employ "never" it apparently means "sometimes" or
"frequently" or "hugely frequently"; it is hard to predict which meaning they will have in mind
at any particular time.
</p><p>
It is, however, certainly true that range voting <i>can</i> exhibit various kinds
of pathologies.   There are an infinite number of different voting systems and different 
possible pathologies that they might fail.    The student can easily get lost in that thicket.
The right way out of it is called <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.
It is a systematic, objective way of comparing voting systems which
effectively examines <i>every</I> possible pathology (of which there are an infinite number), 
weighting each by how serious and how frequent it is.   When that measurement was done,
Range Voting was found to be superior both to IRV, and to every other commonly-mentioned-in-books
voting system &ndash; with either honest voters or strategic voters
(or mixtures)
under all 720 different possible combinations of modeling assumptions tried.

<a name="tideman"></a>
<p>
<b>13 Tideman's book</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
<i>Collective Decisions and Voting</i> by Prof. Nicolaus Tideman states (p.238) that 
Range voting is one of six voting methods that "have defects that are so serious as to 
disqualify them from consideration."
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
We had <a href="TidemanRev.html">reviewed</a> Tideman's book and explained there why Tideman's 
"strategy vulnerability" score was measuring the wrong thing and 
yielded plainly-wrong results.
FairVote here conveniently forgets
to mention that Tideman also finds
<i>instant runoff voting</I> to be "unsupportable" 
(this is on page 240 
for elections in which it is "feasible" to construct a pairwise-table &ndash;
which it evidently was in 
the Burlington 2009 election, since we constructed it).
The difference is that Tideman's analysis showing Range Voting 
"unsupportable" was (as we demonstrated in the review)
flawed, while his arguments showing IRV unsupportable were valid.
As far as we can see 
(as of March 2009) 
they have not been disputed by FairVote or anybody else.
</p><p>
Here's a helpful hint.  If the sole voting-methods book you cite to support your case,
says the very voting method you are trying
to push, is "unsupportable," that's a little tiny clue
your argument might be a teeny tiny bit in trouble.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="bucklin"></a>
<p>
<b>14 Bucklin, Approval, &amp; Range voting</b>(<font color="red">AD</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote/Bouricius:
"In fact, Bucklin, Approval and Range voting quite possibly would have elected Kurt Wright
(the Condorcet-loser among the top three), although this cannot be known for certain &ndash;
it is true that Wright would have won if second choice rankings had been randomly reduced 
in half."
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
First of all, we ran Bucklin on the exact same ballots input by IRV.
It elected Montroll.  Not Wright.  We "know this for certain."
(Of course, with Bucklin, the voters might have voted differently because of making 
different dishonest-strategic lying decisions than with IRV.  But remember, FairVote itself
has assured us that "strategic voting played no role" in this election, so
they themselves think we don't have to worry about that.   In any event: with the official
ballots, Bucklin elects Montroll.)
</p><p>
Second, as our analysis (also) already said, there indeed is no way to
know for <i>certain</i> who range and approval voting would have elected, because they
do not employ rank-order ballots (while IRV and Bucklin do).  
Therefore the only way to guess what Range 
and Approval would
have done is to somehow infer/guess what Burlington's Range/Approval ballots would have
been.
Nevertheless, we have a high degree of confidence they would have elected Montroll for two 
separate reasons. First, by theorem, range (and approval) voting 
<a href="AppCW.html">always</a> 
elects the honest-voter
Condorcet winner (CW) provided enough of 
the approval/range voters are strategic and the CW would with honest voting have been
either the top or second-top range-voting finisher.
(In the "random elections model" in 3-way races, the chances a CW finishes top or
second in range voting <A href="ReasAssump.html#end">are</a> 99%.)
Second, in the present election, the IRV voters in a sense <i>provided</I> "approval threshold"
data by ranking either "W only" (presumably meaning M,K not approved)
or "W and M only" (presumably meaning K not approved) or "W&gt;M&gt;K"
full ordering (presumably meaning <i>either</i> "W &amp; M approved, K not" <i>or</i>
"W approved but K &amp; M not.")   It <i>does not matter</i> which of 
those two "either" possibilities was intended &ndash; no matter which way 
all those choices were made, the votes were such that we <i>always</I>
get Montroll as the approval-voting winner.  That's a lot of room for variation in
our assumptions &ndash; but no matter where we run within that room, Montroll always wins with
the official Burlington ballots.
So while we agree 
we "cannot be <i>sure</I>" Montroll would have been the approval-winner,
it is the guess best-justified by the evidence.   FairVote and Bouricius did not
discuss this whole model and that theorem at all, acting as though we had no basis whatever for
our claims, nor did they mention our analysis had already <i>said</I> we had no way
to be sure.  That's approach D &ndash; <i>distort</i> what we said, then attack <i>that</i>.

<p>
<b>15 Range voting "unadoptable"</b>(<font color="red">A</font>)  <b>&ndash;</b>
FairVote (web page "Single-winner Voting Method Comparison Chart"
cited by Bouricius, downloaded 26 March 2009):
"Most people (and certainly most elected officials) are unlikely to be willing to abandon
the principle of majority rule in favor of Bayesian regret (the core concept of Range Voting). 
If 55% of voters prefer candidate A and 45% prefer candidate B in a two candidate race, 
Range Voting promotes the concept that perhaps B should win if the 45% feel very 
strongly about their choice, while the 55% are only lukewarm about their choice. 
This characteristic of Range Voting, the fact that it expressly rejects 
the notion of majority rule, means that it will never be adopted for government elections."
</p><p>
<b>Response:</b>
Let's see how many bogus uses of the (ever-popular with FairVote) word "never" occur here.
Range voting will "never" be adopted for government elections &ndash; except for the fact it 
already <a href="OlympHist.html">was</a> and used for over 1000 years.
Government elections in which a non-majority wins (or might) could "never" be adopted?
Gee.  We're surprised to learn that the US <i>constitution</i> (2/3 and 3/4 supermajorities
required to amend) could never have been adopted.   And the US senate's
cloture-vote rule (60%).  And US veto-override votes (2/3).
And the USA's procedure for enacting laws (pass by 3-0 majority 
among house, senate, &amp; president; if even <i>one</i> objects, not a law).
And juries in US criminal cases (12-0 required).   
And the USA's original (and present) presidential-election methods.
And golly, FairVote's own favored voting method IRV, as we just saw in Burlington 2009,
refused to elect Montroll despite majorities favoring him over every rival.
</p><p>
As usual, FairVote offers absolutely no evidence for their "unadoptable" and "never"
claims.  They simply
arise from their own immense inner certainty, which is so great as to surmount both the need
for evidence, and the facts that directly contradict them.
</p><p>
(Oh, and we've never particularly advocated range voting for use in <i>two</i>-candidate
elections, at all.   Voting only gets interesting when there are more than 2 candidates.)
</p><p>
Incidentally, you can read about the <a href="LAmayors.html">Los Angeles 2001</a>
mayoral election, which is the only election known to us (as of 2009) in which the
range voting (perhaps) would have "overruled a voter majority."   You may judge for
yourself whether that was a good or bad thing, and compare with the behavior of IRV voting
(which made the same 'overrule').
</p><p>
This FairVote web page is quite interesting.  It presents a list of
voting methods and properties which FairVote "believes are most important to U.S. voters,"
and then in a chart states that the satisfaction of each property by each voting method is
either "low," "medium," "high," "yes," "no," or "yes/no."
You may be interested in our <a href="CompChart.html">own</a> such chart,
or <a href="TidemanRev.html">Tideman's</a> criteria.
</p><p>
<small> Incidentally, some <b>errors</b> we spotted in the FairVote chart are (a)
the Condorcet-loser criterion entry for Condorcet methods should have said "yes/no"
since Condorcet's own
"least reversal" variant fails it, and (b) range voting should have
been <A href="Glossary.html#clones">yes</a> for cloneproof.  
FairVote claims since range voting "can degrade 
to approval which can degrade
to vote-for-one plurality, Range may not satisfy this criterion."
They fail to mention that under the Burlington 2009 IRV rules they themselves
proposed, vote-for-one is allowed, but oddly enough conclude IRV satisfies cloneproofness...
but anyhow not only is their argument bogus, their conclusion is too.  It is entirely irrelevant
whether a range-voting election happens to be the same as a plurality election in the sense
every voter scores exactly one candidate max and all rivals min &ndash; range is still cloneproof.
</small>
</p><p>
Anyhow, rather oddly, by the exact list of properties given by FairVote,
a voting method which satisfies more of them to a greater degree than IRV
(by FairVote's own reckoning) is <a href="SchulzeExplan.html">Schulze beatpath</a>
Condorcet voting
("high" resistance to spoilers and strategic voting, satisfies majority and mutual majority,
satisfies Condorcet-loser and
-winner unlike IRV, cloneproof, and monotonic unlike IRV).
Schulze is also recommended by Tideman in the very book Bouricius cited above which had branded 
IRV as "unsupportable."
</p><p>
Another method that satisfies all the criteria they list for IRV, <i>plus also</i> 
Condorcet-Winner,
is <a href="TidemanRev.html#WBSIRV">WBS-IRV</a> (but it fails "later no harm").
</p><p>
Golly.
So why is FairVote pushing IRV and not Schulze beatpath (and not WBS-IRV) voting?
(As of March 2009, Schulze is not even <i>mentioned</i> anywhere in the entire 
"Fair"Vote website!)
The only two reasons we can see in their chart are
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Schulze fails <A href="#lnh">later no harm</a>.
</li><li>
Schulze "prospects for US adoption" are "low" (just like range voting, but unlike IRV which has
"high" prospects).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Oho.  So why it is that Schulze is "unadoptable"?   Supposedly
because it is complicated and harder to count
than IRV.  Only trouble with that is that Schulze actually is easier to count than IRV in
the sense it is "precinct-summable," that is, with Schulze, but
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">not</a> 
with IRV,
each precinct can publish a concise "subtotal"
and the full election results are deducible from them.

<b>16 Ramabahama defends rules &ndash;</b>
"Ramabahama" (Rama Schneider) 
argued, rather repetitively, that Kiss's election was valid because he
won according to the rules of the IRV system.  Essentially, R would simply repeat the rules,
then state "Kiss won."  If anyone pointed out a logical pathology present in the election, he would
say that was a "what if" scenario, but the actual scenario was: Kiss won.
</p>
<p>
<b>Response:</b>
In some sense, Ramabahama is entirely right.  (And we actually appreciate his
argument rather more than most preceding ones since we think he was actually being honest about 
it, not trying to deceive!)
</p><p>
And if the election rules had instead been
"we will kill a goat, and if the entrails end up pointing South, then Simpson wins"
we daresay Ramabahama would have argued that this was a fully legitimate Simpson victory
and repeated <i>those</i> rules. 
Any attempt by us to say that the election rules <i>themselves</I> were
illogical would have been met (we presume) by simply claiming those were "what if" scenarios.
The actual scenario was: the entrails pointed South, and 
those were the rules &ndash; so Simpson won!
</p>
<p>
But we think even a staunch defender of rules like Ramabahama must feel a little disquiet.
IRV said "Kiss won."  Using the exact same rules and 
same votes <i>except</I> that some Wright voters
switched their vote to Kiss, Kiss would not have won (Montroll would have won).
We daresay Rama#1, in election#1 would have defended Kiss's legitimacy;  
he was elected by the rules.  And in
in election#2, Rama#2 would have defended Montroll's legitimacy;
<i>he</i> was elected by the rules.  
</p><p>
We're just a little worried about what would happen if 
Rama#1 ever encountered Rama#2.
We also are a little worried about what would have happened inside his mind
if the crux Wright&harr;Kiss switching
voter who made the winner change the "wrong way"
had, in fact, <i>been</I> Rama Schneider.

<h2> Update &ndash; responses to the responses to the responses </h2>

<p>
After this page appeared,
Richie &amp; Bouricius sent us some emails about alleged errors herein.
In most cases their arguments, even if correct, fail to
help the case for IRV and make them look even more irresponsible.  But
they did make one good point:
</p>
<p>
<b>Mea culpa:</b>
Bouricius pointed out that the company <i>Election Solutions Inc.</i> (ESI)
he co-founded with Caleb Kleppner
and Kenny Mostern, is <i>not</i> the same company as <i>Voting Solutions Inc.</i> (VSI)
founded by Jim Lindsay, Bill Gram-Reefer, and Steve Willett; and neither is the same as
<i>Premier Election Solutions Inc.</i> formerly known as <i>Diebold Corp.</i>
This Burlington 2009 election was counted using VSI software, not ESI
software, in spite of the fact that ESI featured the output of VSI's software
(i.e. the Burlington vote count) front center on their company web page
(downloaded 30 March 2009) while VSI's web page did not mention it.
Also, ESI's subpage about Burlington 2009 
claims that "Burlington is going to use Choice Plus Pro, a program for tallying IRV elections..."
and then that software written by VSI is freely downloadable from the ESI web site
even though that "software may not be copied or used for commercial purposes without their
(VSI's) permission."
Got all that?  We have now corrected our misunderstandings of this.
</p><p>
<b>Hypothetical Approval/Range victor:</b>
Richie says
"I think the odds are high that [Montroll]
would have lost with approval and, especially, with range." Why?
He felt that the Wright &amp; Kiss backers were "passionate" and hence would have
"bullet voted" voted for their favorite alone, depriving Montroll of, e.g.
intermediate range-scores, and thus preventing him from winning.
</p><p>
Of course,
the official IRV voting system rules <i>allowed</i> voters to "bullet vote," and indeed 
many did so, but <i>despite</i> that
</p>
<ol  type="a">
<li>
Montroll defeated all rivals pairwise, 
</li><li>
The votes <a href="#bucklin">led</a> to an approval-voting victory for Montroll 
<i>under the assumption</i>
the IRV bullet voters continued to bullet-vote with Approval.
</li></ol>
<p>
But supposedly 
with range or approval
the voters would have acted differently, bullet voting <i>more</i>-often, 
under the influence of their "passion."
(I have no idea why Richie feels Montroll would have "especially" lost with range voting.)
He presented no evidence for this conjecture.
</p>
<a name="recountify"></a>
<p>
<b>Recountification and more about invalid ballots:</b>
Concerning their exaggerated
claim, which we'd refuted, of "99.99% valid" ballots, R and/or B point out:
<ul>
<li>
Wright wanted a recount.   The election officials therefore began recounting.
But apparently then Wright decided he didn't really want the recount and so they stopped.
</li><li>
Richie and/or Bouricius apparently claim to have had access to private
unofficial data from this recount, and (they apparently claim)
that data was never incorporated into the official final tallies (which, of course, were what 
we used).
</li><li>
They claim this private data would have, if the recount had been completed,
reduced the official number of "invalid" ballots from 4 to 1.
</li><li>
Furthermore, Bouricius claimed that the 4 invalid ballots, and the 4 ballots that
contained top-rank double-votes and hence were regarded as "valid" but not counted
("exhausted"), were in fact the <i>same</i> 4 ballots,
and thus we overcounted them.  This Bouricius claim <i>directly contradicts</i> the 
<a href="BurlOfficialTallies.html">official final tallies</a>,
which say (and we quote), "8980 valid ballots" and "there were 4 invalid ballots"
and first round: 
"Wright=2951, Kiss=2585, Montroll=2063, Smith=1306, Write-in=36, Simpson=35, Exhausted-Pile=4"
with "total=8980." Note
2951+2585+2063+1306+36+35+4=8980.  It does <i>not</I> sum to 8984.
Bouricius apparently feels, then, that he is right and the official tally is wrong, since
he continues to maintain these 4 were the same 4.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To respond to this:
When assessing the number of invalid ballots and errors in an election, we have to use the
<i>final official tallies</i>.   If the officials and/or voters were confused and imperfect,
that is sad, but their confusion and imperfections <i>count</i>.  
If Richie and Bouricius feel that <i>they</i> would have been (or actually were)
better counters than the officials,
or better voters than the voters, that in no way affects our
conclusions about the <i>actual</i> error/invalid rates <i>in the official counts</I>.  The
plain fact is, <i>after</i> doing whatever counting, re-counting, and re-re-counting they
were ever going to do, they came out with final official tallies and data files, 
and according to those,
the error/invalid rates were 20 times larger than Richie &amp; Bouricius said.
</p><p>
Notice that these final official tallies posted online by Burlington
are date-stamped 3 March 2009 at 8:15pm, i.e. 
<i>before</i> all the misleading posts from FairVote 
came out about "99.99% valid." 
</p><p>
Thus FairVote's "defense" of IRV's supposed "success" 
in this election which (they'd stated before)
"went off without a hitch"
consists in now claiming, basically, that
"The official tallies were wrong. The officials were confused 
and unable/unwilling to incorporate recount-based corrections into their data.  We
(B &amp; R) would have been way smarter than them."!  
<!--<small>
(These last quote marks are for 
delineation purposes only and do not denote their exact words, only their meaning.)
</small>-->
</p><p>
Oh.   Sorry, we didn't realize this was what Richie &amp; Bouricius had meant
by "went off without a hitch."
</p><p>
Looking a little deeper, one may ask: <i>why</i>, after partially completing a recount,
were the Burlington officials unwilling/unable to use whatever data they'd collected 
during the partial recount, to update their official tallies?
We don't know.  (In fact, we don't even know that they did, or did not; we're just relaying
Richie &amp; Bouricius's stories.)
But we do know this:  IRV, unlike a lot of voting methods (range, approval, plurality, 
Borda, Schulze-beatpaths Condorcet...) is <i>not additive.</i>  That is, with IRV
there is <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">no such thing</a>
as a "subtotal."   With additive methods, if recounts in Kalamazoo Precinct 
produce some corrected data,
then Kalamazoo Precinct can publish its new corrected subtotal, and then the central
officials trivially
can combine the precinct subtotals to get the (new corrected) overall total.
With nonadditive methods like IRV, trying to incorporate corrections can be much trickier.
That may have been why Burlington did not (<i>if</i> they did not) 
incorporate corrections from the partial recount.
So there are two possibilities here:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Burlington incorporated corrections from the partial recount into their official totals,
in which case, FairVote's whole story about "99.99%" is complete garbage.
</li><li>
Burlington did not incorporate them, in which case, this is an 
<i>indictment</i> of IRV because
IRV made it too hard to incorporate corrections from partial recounts, thus getting much
higher error-rates and problem-rates than they should have.
With nonadditive methods like
IRV, it is inherently a lot
harder to do either full or partial recounts, 
causing recounting to be both more of a nightmare, 
and
more of a risk of a nightmare.
</li><li>
In view of this, we find it interesting that FairVote is currently 
trying to push IRV for use in
Minnesota.  
As we write this, Minnesota is currently <i>still</i>, 5
months after the elections, in the
midst of a giant legal battle about elections+recounts
between senator-candidates Coleman and Franken.
Neither has been seated in the senate  
(3 months after the rest of the US senate was seated) so the US is currently 
operating with only 99
senators.  Now imagine how this nightmarish battle would have been amplified if
the MN senate election had instead been conducted with a nonadditive method like IRV.
If IRV made it too hard for even a <i>town</i> like Burlington to incorporate
data from a partial recount of its ballots, well... note that    
MN is not a town, but rather a (quite large) state...
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>More on ballots and their invalidity:</b>
Bouricius (still-later response) 
now claims the 4 "invalid" ballots were <i>not</i>
the same as the 4 "exhausted" ballots but were in fact blank, i.e. expressed
no opinion in the mayoral race.  That appears to be true.
Juho Laatu (even-later response)
has now <a href="LaatuInvalidB.html">summarized</a> 
the problematic ballots.
Laatu found 113 ballots "skipping" at least one rank, including 46 which 
skipped 2-or-more ranks; 6 ballots with tied-rankings; and 4 blank ballots.
If all these are counted as "invalid" or at least 
"problematic" then the problem-rate would
be (113+6+4)/8984=<b>1.37%</b>.  
In other words, the Bouricius/Richie/FairVote
"99.99% valid" claim
exaggerated to make the problems appear about a factor of 100 smaller 
than they were.  Even so, we repeat that 
the performance of the Burlington voters and counters remains impressive.

<b>Update &ndash; latest ploy from Rob Richie!</b>
After a period of apparent indecision, 
FairVote appears to have adopted a clever new strategy to
use to respond to anybody on the internet who brings up this Burlington 2009 election:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#00ff88" cellpadding="5">

FairVote head Rob Richie, web post 5 June 2009,
responding to our summarizing sentence
"pretty much every voting mankind ever invented would elect Montroll."

<p>
Richie's gimmick here is that, while very many election methods have been invented by mankind, very
few are currently in use by governments.  The ratio is over 100.  (One reason is that only very
<i>old</i> and <i>bad</i> methods are presently used by governments.)
Richie cleverly changes the question from (what our quote was about)
"which voting methods have mankind invented?" to 
"which are currently in use in public
governmental elections?" hoping the reader will not notice he changed the question.
Then, voila, the new question has the answer Richie (in this case) wants &ndash;
because the only two election methods (among those most commonly attributed to mankind)
that don't elect Montroll happen to exactly coincide with the two bad ones most popular in
governments today.
Hence our original
quote was "clearly" in error!   
But of course, actually, our whole <i>point</i>
in making this Burlington analysis was precisely that the top-two-most popular
election methods used in governments &ndash; plurality &amp; IRV &ndash;
both performed badly.
Plus that ploy about "last place" is so cute;
it makes us sound so clearly nuts on the surface, 
that there is no reason for the reader to actually <i>examine</i>
the numbers to comprehend that actually, the IRV voting method is doing the 
stuff that is nutty.  Richie's idea is to discourage anybody from examining the facts.
</p><p>
<small>
But in <i>other</i> cases,
in which, say, Richie were <i>unsatisfied</i> with election methods in use by some government,
he magically would reject this "argument."  
</small>
</p><p>
(If we were on Mars dying from lack of oxygen, and somebody said "Let's get some oxygen tanks!", 
perhaps Richie then would
say "What?! Nobody on this entire planet is presently breathing 
oxygen, so this suggestion is clearly ludicrous.")
We have to congratulate Richie &ndash; he went <i>beyond</i> the IRV propagandists'
<a href="#categs">usual</a> bogus-argumentation 
techniques <font color="red">ABCD</font> introducing a wholy-<i>new</i>
bogus-logic technique.   Perhaps it should be called "proof by government"?
While we're inspired to see this great intellectual progress from Richie, 
one has to wonder (as usual) 
"why is it, that IRV propagandists have such difficulty 
making a case when restricted to actually 
logically-<i>valid</i> arguments?"
</p><p>
<small>
The man devotes such great effort to devising bogus, yet naively-impressive-sounding,
arguments to promote a poor voting method (IRV), carefully polishing every word.
We wish he'd devote a decent fraction of that effort to promoting a good voting method,
and then he could actually use valid arguments, and actually <i>en</i>courage 
readers to examine the facts.
</small>
</p><p>
There is also another problem with this.
Remember, Montroll would have defeated each and every rival
in a head-to-head contest.  Are there any head-to-head public elections for any office 
anywhere in the world?   Well, yes, actually.  They're quite common.
</p><p>
<b>Finally</b>, Bouricius states that he 
has "more important work to do, than refute all of your claims, 
but I assure readers that nearly all of them are simply false, or 
debatable at best" but he 
"stands by" all his old analysis, which he notes
can be accessed at the following URLs:

Many quotes from these are already present here, with their refutations.
Meanwhile for his part Richie tells us he "did get very far into" reading all this since
"the tone is so nasty."   
(Apparently Richie has a policy of only reading news he finds pleasant.)
<!--   Presumably his pre-eminent concerns with similar tonal issues are the
reason his organization's web site has lied to millions of people for many years and
continues to do so now.

<h2> Compressed Summary </h2>
<ol>
<li>
The IRV propagandists
erroneously claimed invalid ballots were about 20&times; fewer than they really were.
</li><li>
The IRV propagandist who made a ridiculous accusation of "bias" against Gierzinski 
failed to divulge his own far more serious biases and conflicts of interest, such as contracts,
founding IRV company with financial interest in having IRV in Burlington, etc,
instead posing as "non-partisan advocate for fair elections." 
(He also calls himself a "political scientist.")
</li><li>
FairVote IRV propagandists pretended this election suffered no monotonicity failure by 
redefining monotonicity. 
They failed to note, however, that their 
<a href="FairVoteMonotonicityPage.html">own</a> FairVote "monotonicity"
web page's definition of the term agreed with our definition, and according to it
there was a failure. Not only that, it was
exactly analagous to the numerical hypothetical-failure-example that
page had <i>itself</i> given.  Oops.
</li><li>
IRV propagandists pretended this election was free of "no-show failure" by
pretending we'd "cooked the data," but actually it is <i>they</I> who, in
order to deny this failure, need to cook the data <i>tremendously.</i>
</li><li>
IRV propagandists falsely claimed the Condorcet failure did not matter since we ourselves had 
"dismissed" Condorcet.  Well, no.
</li><li>
They then tried for an aura of expertise by making the easily-refuted
claims the obscure "later-no-harm" and
"mutual-majority" criteria were "far more important."  
</li><li>
They then made the ludicrously-false claims range voting had 
"never been used for any governmental elections" nor indeed for "anything."
</li><li>
The IRV propagandists cited only one voting-methods book to support their arguments 
&ndash; by Tideman.
Unfortunately they forgot to point out that 2 pages further on in Tideman's book,
he concludes it was "unsupportable" to use IRV in Burlington.  
Oops.
</li><li>
The IRV propagandists
erroneously claimed there was no way to be certain whom Bucklin voting would have elected.
(It would have elected Montroll.)  Then they pretended we had no basis for our claim
Approval and Range voting would probably have elected Montroll.
</li><li>
We've often wondered why IRV propagandists have often contended (always presenting 
no evidence) that
they could just magically tell that <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> was "unadoptable"
hence should not be supported in spite of its excellent performance.
We found two actual reasons on a FairVote web page referred to by one of the attackers! &ndash;
but unfortunately they both were factually incorrect statements.
