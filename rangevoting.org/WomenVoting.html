<H2>  Women's suffrage </H2>

<p>
How important is it, for democracy, that women can vote?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm sure we'd all agree that this was a big step forward for democracy.  
In fact, many would say that when 
women were not allowed to vote, that <i>wasn't</i> democracy.
</p>
<p>
But let's make a more quantitative assessment.
How many election results have actually been directly changed by women's votes?
</p>
<p>
Women got the vote in the USA a few months before the 1920 election.
In the 22 presidential elections 1920-2004,
women's votes apparently have altered the winner
in exactly <i>one</i> case &ndash; Clinton's election in 1996 &ndash;
and maybe not even then.
(According to exit polls,
the men supposedly preferred Dole by 44% to 43%, but this is a small enough
margin that it is possible that men actually preferred Clinton, in which 
case the women did not change anything.)  Also, as an asterisk, Gore "won"
the popular-vote "election" in 2000 
and this was definitely due to women.
But Bush won the presidency so that had no effect.
</p>
<p>
So in total we'll give women credit for changing one presidential election out of 22.
</p>
<p>
Women have only voted especially detectably differently from men starting in about 1980
&ndash; and also, women began to exceed men in total number of votes also in 1980.
(Since 1980, women have voted more Democratic and men more Republican &ndash; 
<!--feminist and scholar--> Eleanor Smeal dubbed this the 
"gender gap."  Women now exceed men both in numbers and in turnout percentage.)
</p>
<p>
In the 2004 elections, there were 33 senate and 36 state-governor races.
According to CNN exit polls, women altered the winners in 4 cases.
</p>
<p>
In the 2006 elections, there were 34 senate and 11 state-governor races.
According to CNN exit polls, again women altered the winners in 4 cases.

<h3> Summary </h3>

<p>
In 2004 &amp; 2006 women altered 4+4=8 winners  out of 11+34+33+36=114 races (sen&amp;gov),
i.e. altering <b>7.02%</b> of the winners.  
During 1920-2004, women altered 1 president out of 22 races, i.e.
altering <b>4.55%</b> of the winners.  
</p>
<p>
The 2004-2006 count probably 
overestimates the effect of women, since 1980-2006 were years with 
substantially greater "gender gap"
than the historical norm during the 3-times-longer period 1920-2006.
So I am going to give women credit not for 7.02%, but only half that &ndash; <b>3.5%</b> &ndash;
<i>historically averaged</i> over senate and governor races.
(I have no idea what will happen to the gender gap in the future.
I am reckoning historical average effects.)
Combining all these figures and taking account of these historical trends and
putting in a 1&sigma; statistical error bar, our bottom line is...
</p>
<hr>
<p><big>
<i>Women have historically altered <b>(3.7&plusmn;1.2)%</b> of 
US presidential, senate, and state-governor race winners, but at the current time
(1985-2007) they are altering about <b>(7.4&plusmn;2.5)%</b></i>.
</big>

[If you want to phrase it in a more feminist (?) way: essentially the same statements 
ought to be true
about men's votes.]
