RangeVoting.org - Two races in USA 2009 that attracted nationwide interest

<H1> The USA 2009 races that attracted nationwide interest </H1>

<p><small>(Skip to <a href="#summary">conclusions</a>.)</small></P>
<p>
2009 was a non-election-year in most of the USA. 
Exactly three races attracted nationwide interest:
<ol>
<li>
The New Jersey governor race.
</li><li>
The New York district-23 congressional race [special election to replace 
former Congressman, now Army Secretary, John McHugh(R)]
</li><li>
The Virginia governor race.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The last of these was uninteresting since it was a two-man race [McDonnell(R) vs Deeds(D)]
with McDonnell holding a steady 10-to-18 point lead in all polls.
The first two races both are excellent examples of what is wrong with the 
USA's <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system and why
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>,
also called
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>,
would be an improvement.

<h2> The New Jersey Governor race </h2>

<p>
The contenders (pictured left-to-right):
<ul><li>
Jon Corzine (Democrat, governor seeking re-election and <i>extremely</i>
wealthy from previous
<!-- Master of the Universe -->
career as chair &amp; co-CEO of the Wall Street firm Goldman-Sachs)
</li><li>
Christopher J. Christie (Republican who'd served as US attorney for district of NJ 2002-2008); 
</li><li>
Chris Daggett (Independent, PhD in education and 
chief of staff for former gov. Tom Kean, also former regional administrator of EPA 
and commissioner of NJ Dept of Environmental Protection).
</li></ul>
<img src="Corzine_Christie_Daggett.jpg"></a>
<blockquote><small>
In my personal opinion (I live in neighboring New York) all three seemed unusually attractive
and qualified compared to typical candidates, and I rather wish they were running
in New York instead...  
</small></blockquote>
<p>
Corzine clearly had the greatest familiarity with the job (not surprisingly
since he was <i>in</i> the job) but many felt he had not performed as he should, with, e.g,
NJ forecast to have a $8 billion deficit in 2010; and Corzine's
extreme wealth (and willingness to use it to, essentially, "buy votes" and support the
"old boy network" of "pay to play" NJ politics, rather than striving to clean it up) 
left many disenchanted &ndash; especially in the economic post-crash climate
in which Goldman-Sachs had been heavily implicated.   E.g. 44, 
including three NJ mayors, two state assemblymen, and 5 rabbis, were charged in July as
the culmination of a federal money-laundering and corruption 2-year investigation.
(Corzine: "Unfortunately you don't give people lie-detector tests and then ask them for 
their vote in the Legislature.")
Christie attacked him for "too many taxes" and his abandoned scheme to sell the
New Jersey Turnpike to raise cash.  However, Christie was not 
exactly in a great position to exploit anti-Wall-Street angst since his own
wife and brother were themselves both wealthy Wall Streeters.
Finally, Daggett attracted support as the apparently
least-bought, most-independent-seeming candidate.   
</p><p>
All three debated several times throughout October on radio and TV, with the final debate on 
the 22nd.  Daggett appeared to have "won" the debates in the public mind (to a greater extent
than the others, anyhow); he also benefited from Corzine and Christie 
each using their large financial and hence media resources to savage each other.
</p>
<p>
The polls were as follows.  First, there were
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score-voting</a> style polls with 0-100
score "temperature" range conducted by "Democracy Corps" 
(640 likely voters, Oct 20-21;
604 likely voters, Oct 27-28):

<p>
These polls constitute a near 3-way tie, most probably with Daggett 
the winner if any one is to be singled out.
<p>
Second, here are various
<a href="Approval.html">approval-voting</a>-style polls,
conducted respectively by PPP
(Oct 23-26 of 630 likely voters by telephone),
Quinnipiac University (Oct 20-26; released Oct 28, 1267 LVs),
Rasmussen Reports (telephone survey 26 Oct; 1000 LVs),
and MonmouthUniversity/Gannett (722 LVs).
Call these "P," "Q," "R," and "M."

Rasmussen Repts (telephone survey 26 Oct 1000 LVs):

<p>
Note that both Corzine and Christie have more disapproval than approval;
only Daggett is, overall, (slightly) approved.
</p>

<p>
Third, the Quinnipiac poll 
also asked Daggett voters <i>only</i> whom they'd
take as their second choice:
</P>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="orange" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<th bgcolor="#FFEEEE">Daggett 2nd choices(Quinn'c)</th>
<td>CORZINE 27%</td>
<td>CHRISTIE 43%</td>
<td>WON'T VOTE 18%</td>
<td>SOMEONE ELSE 4%</td>
<td>DON'T KNOW 9%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="#FFEEEE">Daggett 2nd choices(PPP)</th>
<td>CORZINE 45%</td>
<td>CHRISTIE 36%</td>
<td>DON'T KNOW 19%</td>
</tr>
</table> 
<p>
This also was asked by a later PPP poll (Oct 31-Nov 1, 994 LVs) 
which, note, got different results, perhaps because of voters leaving Daggett to support
Christie during the intervening period.  Keep in mind that these "second choice" polls
had small sample sizes and hence large error bars of order &plusmn;10 points.   For this
reason they did not really contradict one another, and combined they suggest Daggett voters
would prefer Christie (54%) over Corzine (46%) ignoring the "don't know"s.
<p>
I am unaware of any analogous "second choice" polling data 
for Corzine and Christie voters, but <i>speculate</i>
that most would prefer Daggett over the other C.
If so, then Daggett is the "Condorcet winner," i.e. would beat either opponent in a
head-to-head race.
</p>

<p>
But unfortunately, the election was <i>not</i> conducted via score or approval (nor
rank-order-ballot) voting; 
it was conducted via <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.  
This meant the usual "must vote for one of the top two" strategic dynamic came into play
to (massively) distort public opinion.  The media played its role by
widely urging voters not to "waste their vote" on Daggett
while the <i>New York Times</I> ran a front page story  (30 Oct)
about their interviews with Christie and Corzine,
but refusing to discuss or interview Daggett.
</p>
<blockquote>
<small>
The PPP Oct 26-28 poll asked "Do you think it is possible for Chris Daggett to win?"
Results: 14% yes, 72% no, 14% not sure.     Obviously if 80% of voters think Daggett has no chance
so that a plurality-vote for him is "wasted" no matter how objectively-good a candidate he is...
then Daggett indeed <i>does</i> have no chance!   
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com">Real Clear Politics</a>, 
by averaging many different party-unaffiliated
pre-election polls conducted October 20-Nov 1
totaling over 6000 likely voters, found an almost exact (which certainly 
is within the statistical error)
2-way tie:
</P>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="pink" cellpadding="3">
<caption> Plurality-voting-style pre-election polls </caption>
<tr>
<td>CORZINE 41.6%</td>
<td>CHRISTIE 42.6%</td>
<td>DAGGETT 10.4%</td>
</tr>
</table> 
<p>
Note the tremendous distortion caused by plurality-style voting: the only candidate 
approved more than he is disapproved (who also is
probably the Condorcet "beats all" winner)
is with plurality voting far behind with no chance of victory!
Note that IRV would have eliminated Daggett in the first round
(same &quot;<a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html">center squeeze</a>&quot; thwarted-majority
pathology as in  <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a>)
and hence would not have repaired that pathology.
However, if Corzine had won the election, it quite plausibly would have been because
Daggett played the role of a "spoiler" to deny votes to Christie, and IRV <i>would</i>
repair <i>that</i> pathology.

<h2> The NY-23 congress race </h2>

<p>
The contenders were William L. Owens (Democrat, Air Force Captain, lawyer, and
adjunct professor of business law;
also endorsed by "Working Families Party"),
Dierdre "Dede" Scozzafava (Republican Assemblywoman, also endorsed by "Independence Party"), 
and Douglas L. Hoffman (Conservative party; manages an accounting firm; no political experience
but was controller of the organizing committee
for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, where he lives, and was a staff sergeant in
the army NY National Guard), 
pictured left-to-right.  The district was the largest and northernmost in New York
and with an amazing shape <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandered</a>
to resemble a diseased letter "M."
It and its predecessors had elected a Republican every time since about 1870, but
the "reliable Republican" era seemed perhaps at risk of ending, since, e.g. this district had
just voted for Obama(D) by 52-47% in the 2008 US presidential election.
</p>
<img src="NY23.2009.jpg"></a><img src="NY23annot.png"></a>
<p>
A radio and TV debate were held.  Hoffman did not come to the North Country Public Radio debate
and apologized later for his no-show.  All three came to a TV debate held in Syracuse Oct 29.
However, Syracuse lies well outside the district.  A video recording
of that debate was scheduled to be aired
<i>within</i> the district on 1 Nov at 7pm on ABC 50.  (Election day: 3 November.)
Those who heard the debate did not regard it as either devastating or incredibly uplifting for
any of the three.
</p>
The results of two 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score-voting</a> style polls 
with 4 allowed scores
were as follows.

<p>
(SUM and AVERAGE based on 3, 2, 1, 0 scores.)
Based on these polls, the race is close, with Scozzafava being the SUM winner,
but Hoffman would win based on AVERAGE.  Based on <i>both</i>, however, Owens
might win. (The reason for this discrepancy
was that Scozzafava, the only candidate who
previously served in elected office,
was the best-known and hence got the fewest NO-OPINION scores; while Hoffman
as the least-known got the most.)
<a href="Approval.html">Approval-voting</a>-style polls were also conducted:

<p>
Based on these results, again Scozzafava would have won based on total number of approvals
(before she dropped out); but we include the poll afterwards or 
base it on the approve/disapprove <i>ratio</i>, Owens would win; albeit if we only use the
<i>later</i> polls Hoffman is ahead of Owens.
Again the reason for the total-vs-ratio 
discrepancy is that Scozzafava was the best-known candidate
i.e. got the fewest NO-OPINIONs.
(In a real election instead of a poll those discrepancies would shrink because few or no voters
would remain undecided.)
The Siena Mid-October poll indeed found that
"Hoffman remains the least-known candidate;
nearly half of those who say they are voting for Hoffman don't 
know enough about him to have a favorable or unfavorable opinion"(!).
</p>
<p>
The DailyKos/Research2000 oct 19-21 poll also asked Hoffman-voters <i>only</i>:
"Which candidate would be your second choice, Bill Owens, 
the Democrat, or Dede Scozzafava, the Republican?"  Result:

I am unaware of any analogous "second choice" polling data

<p>
In the event my Owens-2nd-choice guesses are correct, then we see that
(at least, as of about Oct 28) 
Scozzafava was the <i>Condorcet winner</i>, i.e. would have defeated either
rival in a head-to-head race.   This also indicates that this election would have 
exhibited both &quot;<a href="IncentToExagg.html">favorite-betrayal</a>&quot;
and "thwarted majority" 
malfunctions if it had been conducted with 
instant runoff voting (IRV).  Specifically (consult first-choice polls below), 
Scozzafava would have been eliminated 
immediately by IRV.
if the election-winner is Owens, that means 
the Hoffman voters would have been 
<i>better off betraying their favorite</i> and instead voting for
their  honest second choice &ndash; Scozzafava. If the election winner is Hoffman,
then the Owens voters would have been better off betraying <i>their</I> favorite
to vote Scozzafava.  Either way, with IRV voting for your true favorite was a strategically-stupid
move for either the Owens or Hoffman voters, which caused their most-hated candidate to win!
(This is yet-another refutation of the myth that with IRV you can vote for your true
favorite "without fear of 'spoiler'-effects.")
</p><blockquote><small>
IRV only works well in &quot;<a href="TwoAndAHalf.html">two-and-a-half candidate</a>&quot;
races, not in genuine 3-way races like this one.
</small></blockquote>
<p>
However, unfortunately, the election was not conducted via score or approval (nor
rank-order-ballot) voting; 
it was conducted via <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.  Here are the results of
plurality-style pre-election polls, in reverse-chronological order, with "(R)" for

<p>
As you can see, Scozzafava initially held the lead in these polls, peaking in late 
September with a 7-point lead on
her nearest rival.  However, then Owens assumed the lead, and in the final polls it became
an approximate tie between Owens and Hoffman, with Scozzafava 11-16 points behind.
</P>

<p>
<b>What happened?</b>
In a historically-Republican district and with Scozzafava(R) reasonably popular and
the only one of the three candidates who'd held elected office, 
initially it seemed she was going to win easily.
</P><p>
However, fringe ultra-right elements in the nationwide Republican Party
such as (former Alaska Gov.) Sarah Palin, (former Pennsylvania Sen.)
Rick Santorum, and the "Club for Growth"
saw her as "too liberal" and swooped in with cash, endorsements, $300,000 in TV ads,
and a publicity campaign to
try to boost the campaign of the initially-little-known Hoffman and try to make this
race a "referendum on the future of Republicanism" and to "purify" the Republican party.
Scozzafava was indeed remarkably Democrat-like for a Republican, e.g. she was one of only
four Republicans in the NY legislature to support "gay marriage," and she supports the legality of
abortion, contrary to the Republican Party Platform.  
(Although actually, by removing Scozzafava from the NY legislature to the US congress, 
her stances on those two issues would become far less relevant.)
Plus (yikes!) her husband held a 
position in a <i>union</i>!
</p><blockquote><small>
Scozzafava's husband, Ron McDougall, was president of the
Jefferson-Lewis-St. Lawrence Central Trades and Labor Council, and endorsed
Owens after his wife withdrew (and before she endorsed Owens). She had the
endorsement of a UAW local, and the NY AFL-CIO had stayed out of the race.
Somewhat lost in the media frenzy
about Scozzafava's Democrat-like stances on those particular
two issues, was the fact that she
had voted <b>95%</b> with
the Republicans while a NY assemblywoman.
</small></blockquote>
</P><p>
It worked: Hoffman then grew in popularity and became better-known, although even near
the <i>end</I> of the campaign almost half <i>his own</I> voters said they still 
did not know enough
about him to rate him "favorably" or "unfavorably."
Hoffman was also aided by the fact that Scozzafava, who perhaps had not perceived him as a threat
until too late, failed to prepare attack ads against him.   Such ads would have been easy:
Hoffman actually did not even <i>live</i> in his district (albeit this is not 
quite as peculiar as it sounds, see map) and he (accompanied by former Republican leader,
now chair of "FreedomWorks," Dick Armey)
suffered an embarrassing <a href="WDThoffmanArmey.html">interview</a>
with a local newspaper, the <i>Watertown Daily Times</i>,
in which Hoffman's ignorance of local issues was made highly apparent, e.g.
</P>
<blockquote>
When asked about the rooftop highway that could connect Watertown to Plattsburgh, Mr. Hoffman said he was "open to reviewing and studying it."
When asked about winter navigation on the St. Lawrence Seaway, he took no position. When asked about widening and deepening the Seaway, he again said nothing.
</blockquote>
<p>
(The newspaper was furious.  I don't think I've ever seen such a negative reaction to
a candidate by the newspaper interviewing him.)
Also Mary Snow on CNN interviewed Hoffman. She asked him to name the three local issues
most important to his district. 
He couldn't do it! 
</P>
<p>
Fears then arose that thanks to a Scozzafava-Hoffman "split" of the rightist vote,
the Democrat Owens might (unjustly) win.   [And fueled by that, 
the <I>Democrats </I> swooped in with
funding for Owens, causing Scozzafava(R) to be outspent by both sides, a
highly unusual development in this sort of district.]
That fear naively sounds plausible.
However, the score- and approval-style poll data
above do not greatly support that theory.   Score and Approval voting are immune to 
"vote splitting" and they found high support, plausibly enough to win, for Owens.
I conclude, therefore, that an Owens victory would <i>not</I> be "clearly 
unjust" and <i>not</i> clearly caused by
a "vote split."
This data instead supports the notion that the NY-23 voters were not so unsophisticated.  They
(or anyhow a lot of them) actually saw all three candidates as different and did <i>not</I> view
Scozzafava &amp; Hoffman as mere "clones" (or Scozzafava &amp; Owens either).
</P><p>
The Grand Poobahs of the Republican Party, however, apparently were
not interested in score- and approval-voting data
and feared in their usual habitual unsophisticated manner 
that this race was going to be a Republican-Conservative "vote split" pathology as usual.
They apparently did not consider that this race might be atypical in that respect and
had to be viewed in a less-naive way.
</p><p>
Hence, top Republicans apparently made a strategic decision, in the final week
of the campaign, to backstab their own candidate Scozzafava.   Former NY governor G.Pataki(R)
and future(?) NY governor R.Giuliani &ndash; the two most popular and best-known Republicans 
in the state &ndash;
both suddenly came out with widely-publicized endorsements of
Hoffman.  <!-- McHugh: did not endorse anybody with 4 days to go. -->
Anonymous Republican "strategic consultants" were quoted in the press
as saying they had no choice because Scozzafava had dropped in the polls and hence was 
clearly going to lose &ndash; votes
for her would be "wasted."  They felt they had to give Hoffman an extra boost to
try to ensure he would defeat Owens.
</p><blockquote><small>
It was clear that Giuliani's endorsement of Hoffman <i>was</i>
a purely-cynical strategic calculation
since, e.g. Giuliani: "I'm pro-choice. I'm pro-gay rights."
And Pataki had also come out in favor of abortion rights, <i>signed</i> New York's
gay rights bill into law, and appointed the openly-gay Mayor D.Stewart of Plattsburgh
(which lies in district 23) into his administration &ndash;
although Pataki does oppose same-sex marriage.
(Incidentally, it is hard to believe these two luminaries were unconsulted 
when the NY Republican Party 
initially nominated Scozzafava; nor does it seem believeable
the GOP would have done so if either had registered strong objections.)
</small></blockquote>
<p>
The trouble with that strategy is this:   No poll data was available about the "second choices"
of Scozzafava voters.  
</p><blockquote><small>
It is conceiveable, but unlikely, the Republican Party had access to 
such data via their own private pollsters.  I say "unlikely" because such private polls
would normally be conducted by Scozzafava herself, not the nationwide party, and she would
have no motivation to enquire about that question &ndash;
and also no motivation to divulge this data, 
even if she had it and it pointed Hoffman-ward, to those likely to backstab her.
</small></blockquote><p>
It is entirely possible that more Scozzafava voters preferred Owens than Hoffman.
[Owens arguably was more similar than Hoffman to Scozzafava...]
If so, then by backstabbing Scozzafava and telling her voters not to "waste their vote" on her,
the result would actually be to help <i>Owens</i> win.
If so, then, those Republicans would have been better off (which anyway was the honorable
thing) supporting their own candidate.  Sometimes the obvious move actually is the right one!
(And since Scozzafava had led the polls only
1 month before, it would seem at least conceivable that
a sudden infusion of support and money from the national party might
be enough to allow her to come back and win.)
</p><p>
But that did not happen.  The backstab fired up on about Oct 28; 
Scozzafava duly collapsed in the polls, and the usual "must vote for one of the 'top two'"
dynamic of the flawed plurality voting system slammed into gear.  The collapse in Scozzafava's
poll numbers did <i>not</i> seem clearly to be benefitting either Hoffman or Owens
more than the other in the pre-election
polls, so it  remained unclear (to me, anyhow) whether this
backstab actually worked for the strategic purpose the stabbers had in mind, or the opposite!
</p><p>
Scozzafava then, amazingly, suddenly saw that it was in her, her political future's, and/or 
her party's best interest for her to <i>withdraw</I> from the contest!
</p><blockquote><small>
Dede Scozzafava, the Republican and Independence parties candidate,
announced Saturday [Oct 31] that she is suspending her campaign for the 23rd
Congressional District and releasing all her supporters.
<br>
The state Assemblywoman has not thrown her support to either Doug
Hoffman, the Conservative Party candidate, or Bill Owens, the
Democratic candidate.
<br>
"Today, I again seek to act for the good of our community," Ms.
Scozzafava wrote in a letter to friends and supporters. "It is
increasingly clear that pressure is mounting on many of my supporters
to shift their support. Consequently, I hereby release those
individuals who have endorsed and supported my campaign to transfer
their support as they see fit to do so. I am and have always been a
proud Republican. It is my hope that with my actions today, my party
will emerge stronger and our district and our nation can take an
important step towards restoring the enduring strength and economic
prosperity that has defined us for generations."
<br>
Ms. Scozzafava told the <i>Watertown Daily Times</i> that Siena Research
Institute poll numbers show her too far behind to catch up &ndash; and she
lacks enough money to spend on advertising in the last three days to
make a difference. 
[Quoted from <i>Watertown Daily Times</I> 31 October story by Jude Seymour.]
</small></blockquote>
<p>
This didn't make sense to me.
The TV debate between the three <i>had not yet been broadcast</I> at the moment Scozzafava 
withdrew.  If I'd been her, I would have stayed in the race at least until after the broadcast!
In view of this it seemed likely Scozzafava must have been placed under great pressure by her
Party.
</p><p>
If we disregard strategy and just view things from the
standpoint of party <i>loyalty</i>, the backstab was reprehensible.
It somewhat resembled the previous Republican backstab of Alan Schlesinger(R) in the 3-way
CT senator race of 2004, where the Republicans switched their support to Joe Lieberman
(Independent, former Democrat) who (sure enough) won.   That move had been understandable since
Schlesinger had been involved in scandals involving unpaid gambling debts and fake names
and was polling 8% versus Lieberman (50%) and Ned Lamont (38%).
But Scozzafava was <i>not</i> involved in any scandal and while trailing in the polls, was not
anywhere near as tremendously behind as Schlesinger had been;
indeed she'd been leading only 1 month before.  Further, while
the Schlesinger-backstab <i>worked</i> to ensure  Lieberman's election,
it was far less clear the Scozzafava backstab would "work." 
It is even possible some fraction of the voters, <i>because</i> of their disgust at this backstab, 
decided to vote anti-Republican.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote><small>
<b>Bruce Gilson comments:</b>
This election is approximately the mirror image of the <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a>
mayoral election.
Instead of (as in Burlington) having a relatively liberal constituency with a
right-of-center, left-of-center, and far-left candidate, there is a
relatively conservative constituency (Obama may have won it, but it hasn't sent
a Democrat to Congress since 1870) with a left-of-center, a right-of-center,
and a far-right candidate.
So Owens is the equivalent of Wright, Scozzafava of Montroll, and Hoffman of
Kiss. And if Burlington had used plurality, Wright would have
won. So the analogy would point to Owens winning.
<br><br>
Scozzafava was leading in the early polls, because it's a Republican district
and third parties are usually discounted. As people got to realize that the
split in the right wing would elect Owens, they consolidated. (A
split GOP elected Woodrow Wilson in 1912.) To avoid this outcome, they're all
moving to Hoffman. It's doing the equivalent of the Burlington IRV process, but
before the election, instead of during the counting.
</small></blockquote>
<p>
<b>Late-breaking update:</b>
The nationwide GOP, including </P>
<blockquote><small>
Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Republican National Committee Chairman
Michael Steele (these three had previously endorsed Scozzafava),
Republican Whip  Eric Cantor of Virginia, 
and Texas Representative Pete Sessions, chairman of the 
National Republican Congressional Committee
</small></blockquote>
<p>
all, immediately after Scozzafava's withdrawal statement above, announced that it/they 
now endorsed Hoffman.
But then Scozzafava <i>herself</i> <a href="ScozzEndOwens.html">stunned</a> the GOP by announcing
she'd decided to endorse <i>Owens</i>!   (During the intervening period, she'd "reflected," 
consulted some prominent Democrats including NY Senator Charles Schumer, and also been 
basically insulted by Hoffman while praised by Owens.)   
Hoffman then denounced her as a "turncoat," while the <i>Watertown Daily Times</i>,
which had been endorsing Scozzafava, switched its endorsement to Owens, claiming
Hoffman was running as an "ideologue" while Owens would "serve [the district's]
interests first and foremost." The <i>Ogdensburg Journal</I> felt similarly.
</p><p>
This move enhanced and partially-confirmed
our "failed-backstab" hypothesis
above &ndash; that actually Scozzafava voters might move toward Owens more than Hoffman.
The two final pre-election polls by Siena and PPP (not shown)
both happened <i>during</i> the unfolding of this soap-opera, so it was highly
unclear exactly what the voters were going to make of it.  Siena saw
a doubling of the number of "undecided" voters and argued
that whomever those undecideds eventually supported ought to win.
PPP thought Hoffman was clearly now going to win and indeed that he
appeared (based on "A versus B" comparative polling) now to be the "Condorcet winner,"
<i>but</I> looking
at their poll data both before and after the Scozzafava endorsement of Owens
(they could do this because they'd kept track of the time; mostly this poll occurred
pre-endorsement) 
it appeared that this endorsement was 
causing a 2% drop in Hoffman support and a 7% rise in Owens support (these percentages are
in terms of the full voter pool) so that wasn't really clear. 
Further, all these polls mostly or entirely
occurred <i>before</I> 
the TV debate broadcast!   So the race was still developing in an unclear direction
on the eve of election day.

CNN projection:
&quot;The three-way race in New York's 23rd congressional district ended Tuesday night 
with a surprise Democratic win &ndash; the first for the party in the reliably-Republican 
district since the 19th century.
Democrat Bill Owens defeated Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman to claim victory 
in a race where an internal GOP fight drew national attention &ndash; and forced the 
party's candidate, Dede Scozzafava, out of the campaign.&quot;
<br>
The results based on counting 92% of the vote were Owens 49%, Hoffman 45%, Scozzafava 5%.
Consequently
Hoffman conceded on 3 Nov, and Owens was sworn in. 
Scozzafava later remarked on national 
TV that she thought that if
such Republican internecine "purges" continued, it would risk the downfall of her party, and
(further) she believed that a <i>diversity</i>
of views are required in government to solve problems, and this sort 
of "purification" of Republicans could abolish that diversity.
<br>
The only problem: counting and recounting continued,
and Owens' margin <a href="OwensRecountSPS.html">narrowed</a>, making it still seem possible
as of 12 November,
that <i>Hoffman</i> actually may have won!
<br>
Still-later note: Owens did eventually officially win.

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
In both these races, it is clear that harm was caused by not having 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>, and this injury to democracy 
would <i>not</i> have been healed by
<a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting</a> (IRV).
</P><p>
In the NJ governor race, the truth revealed by the score-voting style poll
was that all three candidates enjoyed approximately equal popular support.
The plurality voting system's "must vote for one of the top two" 
strategic dynamic, though (interacting with media advice not to "waste your vote"),
unjustly deprived Daggett of any chance and undemocratically
left him far behind.  However, the score-voting and approval-style polls both
indicated Daggett was the most-probable true-winner (as well as probably the
"Condorcet winner" who would have defeated either rival head-to-head).
This same huge undemocratic distortion
also would have happened with instant (or non-instant) runoff voting.
</p><p>
In the NY-23 congress race, the same perceived strategic 
dynamic led the Republican Party cynically to backstab its
own handpicked candidate Scozzafava, who (despite probably
being the Condorcet "beats all" winner)
then plunged to
an unjustly-vast defeat.  The situation was so insane that she 
actually felt it best to <i>drop out</I> of the race to "aid" her party and/or career.
The truth, as revealed by the score-style poll, is that all three should have been close.
Ironically, it might have been the case that
this strategic perception by Republican leaders actually was <i>wrong</i> and by pressuring
Scozzafava to withdraw they actually accomplished the opposite of their goal.
With score voting, there is no "vote splitting" and
there would have been no perceived need (wrong or not) for the backstab; e.g. those 
Republicans could
simply have supported their own candidate Scozzafava while recommending Hoffman as second choice.
Note also that Scozzafava would have been eliminated with "instant runoff voting"
despite being Condorcet beats-all winner, illustrating IRV's dreaded 
<a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html">center squeeze</a> pathology
which causes IRV to <a href="IrvExtreme.html">favor extremists</a> and act against centrists.

Mr. Hoffman won't have a ballot. It's not fraud. It's geography. His wife, Carol, won't have a ballot, either. That's because they live in Lake Placid, which is in the 20th Congressional District. That's two lost votes for Mr. Hoffman right there.

Watertown Daily News
Few answers
Hoffman unfamiliar with district issues
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2009
Douglas L. Hoffman, the Conservative Party candidate for the 23rd Congressional District, showed no grasp of the bread-and-butter issues pertinent to district residents in a Thursday morning meeting with the Watertown Daily Times editorial board.

In a nearly hour-long session, Mr. Hoffman was unable to articulate clear positions on a number of matters specific to Northern New Yorkers rather than the national level campaign being waged in a three-way race for the vacant seat of now-Army Secretary John McHugh.

Mr. Hoffman spoke only generally about the need to improve the country's economy and to create jobs but provided no details, which were also lacking as well in his broadly stated willingness to help our military personnel. Help in what way he could not say.

Regarding the proposed rooftop highway across the top of the district linking Watertown to Plattsburgh, Mr. Hoffman said only that he was open to studying the idea that has been around for years and will require federal financial assistance to complete.

Mr. Hoffman had no opinion about winter navigation and widening the St. Lawrence Seaway with their potential environmental damage. He was not familiar with the repercussions of a proposed federal energy marketing agency for the Great Lakes, which could pay for Seaway expansion contrary to district interests.

A flustered and ill-at-ease Mr. Hoffman objected to the heated questioning, saying he should have been provided a list of questions he might be asked. He was, if he had taken the time to read the Thursday morning Times editorial raising the very same questions.

Coming to Mr. Hoffman's defense, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who accompanied the candidate on a campaign swing, dismissed regional concerns as "parochial" issues that would not determine the outcome of the election. On the contrary, it is just such parochial issues that we expect our representative to understand and be knowledgeable about, if he wants to be our voice in Washington.
