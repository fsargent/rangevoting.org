<H2> IRV winner=loser failure &ndash; how common is it?  </H2>

<p>
In Instant Runoff Voting (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>),
it can occur that the winner is the <i>same</i> candidate as the winner
would have been if all voters reversed all rank orderings ("trying to elect the
worst").
Here's a simple <a href="IrvRevFail.html">example</a>.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow" align="right">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>B>C>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A>B>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C>A>B</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
At right is the simpl<i>est</i>
example (in the sense of having the fewest candidates and voters):
<br>
In this 5-voter 3-candidate
IRV election, <b>A wins</b> (after C is eliminated).  But if we <i>reverse</I> all votes
(trying to determine the worst candidate rather than the best!) then <b>A still "wins"</b>
(after B is eliminated).
</p>

<p>
That is one reason it is rather hard to maintain (as IRV propagandists Rob Richie and S. Hill
unfortunately often nevertheless do) the bogus claim
that "IRV always produces 'true-majority winners'."
</p><p>
[<small>
In some Condorcet methods, winner=loser can also occur; but it is never
possible
for a beats-all Condorcet winner to be the same as the loses-to-all Condorcet
loser if both exist; and in some Condorcet methods such as Schulze beatpaths,
"reversal
failure" i.e. winner=loser is <i>never</i> possible, at least if ties are disregarded. 
Ditto
in <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> and 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting: winner=loser is <i>never</i> possible if ties
disregarded.
</small>]
</p><p>
How often does IRV reversal failure actually happen? In the usual
simplistic probabilistic "<a href="RandElect.html">random elections</a>" model 
(all elections equally likely &ndash; that is,
all
voters independently choose a rank-order at random, all orders equally likely),
the answer (<small>each datapoint based on &ge;20K Monte 
Carlo elections, but <b>bold</b> datapoints based on &ge;100K; probably I give
too many significant figures in percentages</small>) is:

<p>
This particular probablistic model of course is usually politically unrealistic
but in my
<a href="FunnyElections.html">experience</a>
(perhaps surprisingly) it nevertheless usually delivers estimates of
frequencies
of goofy phenomena, which happen to be pretty close to the frequency estimates
you get
by trying to look at real elections throughout history.
So until further evidence comes along, use this as your frequency estimate.
</p>

<p>
I have also done two Monte Carlo simulations each using an infinite number of voters.
They find:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="lightgreen">
<caption>
With <b>&infin;</b> voters per election, % of <b>3</b>-candidate 
IRV elections in which winner=loser is:

<H2> IRV eliminates a "Condorcet winner"? &ndash; how common is <i>that</i>?  </H2>

<p>
This is the question of the frequency of the "Peru Scenario"
(we call it that because this happened in the <a href="Peru06Exec.html">Peru 2006</a>
presidential election)
in which a candidate who would beat every opponent in a head-to-head race,
is eliminated by IRV.  
(Same thing <a href="FunnyElections.html">also happened</a>
in the France 2007 and Chile 1970 Presidential elections.)
This is a different phenomenon which again makes it rather hard to maintain
that  "IRV always produces 'true-majority winners'."  (!)
</p><p>
In the same probabilistic model, we showed in
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#puzz17">puzzle 17</a>, this has frequency
<b>3.71%</b> in 3-candidate races 
(and <b>3.23%</b> in the Dirichlet model).  
However in "1-dimensional" politics it
is more like <a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html#csqueeze">25-33% common</a>.
</p>

<H2> Should we care about problems that are this rare?  </H2>

<p>
Although the winner=loser and eliminated-Condorcet-winner phenomena
both are very embarrassing for IRV, they
are fairly uncommon. Nevertheless in the <b>659-member UK house of commons</b>,
if elected via IRV we would expect a <b>dozen</b> or so of the races each election to
be winner=loser races, and even more to be eliminated-Condorcet-winner races.
Then there would be consequent screaming (unless of
course they made the votes a secret so nobody knew to scream, which in the
past has been the usual method of preventing screaming in IRV elections &ndash; but
in the last few years there has started to be a trend toward actually posting
IRV election
data on the internet)...
</p>

<p>
So this is not a neglectible problem.
However, it <i>is</i> fairly rare.
</p><p>
What is much more common is the IRV "favorite-betrayal
pathology" where ranking your true favorite top is strategically unwise,
so therefore you (not being a strategic idiot) vote dishonestly.  That problem 
<a href="IRVStratPf.html#irv">happens</a>
in 19.6% of 3-candidate elections in this model.  But if
<i>all</i> a voter knows is that third-party
candidates win a lot more rarely than 19.6%, then that voter is <b>always</b> strategically
better off dishonestly betraying her favorite in her vote.  We repeat.  Always.
I.e. in 100% of elections in this model.     <i>This</i> problem is <i>not</i> rare.
</p><P>
<small>
(Note: it has sometimes been wrongly claimed by IRV advocates that you cannot vote strategically
without knowing how all the other IRV voters are voting, and without doing a tremendous
amount of difficult thinking.  False.  The truth is, you don't need to know a damn thing besides
"third party candidates rarely win" and you don't need to think at all.)
</small>
</p>

<H3> Postscripts </H3>

<p>
So is there <i>any</i> sense in which it is true that
"IRV always produces 'true-majority winners'."?
</p>

<p>
Well, you could just <i>define</i> "true-majority winner" to <i>mean</i> "IRV winner"
and then it would be true.  That'd be laughable.  We could similarly define 
 "true-majority winner" to <i>mean</i> "<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> winner"
and then the plurality voting system, instead, would always deliver a true-majority winner.
Or the Coombs voting system.  Or whatever (a random-winner dice-roll system...).
This is a joke.  
</p><p>
Another joke is to note that IRV's final round (A versus B) always makes A win over B
exactly when a majority of the voters prefer A over B.  (That is 
<a href="IrvExhaustionSF.html">false</a> in the <a href="IRV3.html">top-3</a> 
variant of IRV used in San Francisco, but never mind that.) Therefore 
"A is a true-majority winner."  By that logic, <i>every</i> candidate not a lose-to-all
loser, would be a "true majority winner"!  I.e, in the <a href="RandElect.html">limit</a>
of a large number of
candidates, <i>every</i> candidate in almost every election would be a
"true majority winner"!  That'd be happy for them all &ndash; but totally ridiculous.
</p><p>
The truth is, for this to be a meaningful assertion we need to
agree with what political scientists normally mean when they say "majority winner" &ndash;
one whom, a majority would agree, should win in a race versus any opponent.
And then, sorry, our counterexamples show the statement is just false.  
(Here's <a href="IRVamp.html#bad">another interesting counterexample</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<small>
PS: If you think I use this "random elections" model for my <a href="IEVS">simulations</a>
generally, you are
confused;
the <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
studies that make range voting look good compared to other systems, are based on
trying a
very <i>large</i> number of different probability models that are mostly not at all as
simplistic
as this one, and Range's superiority is highly robust across models.
