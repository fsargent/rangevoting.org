<H2> Importance of Gerrymandering</H2>

<p>
How important is Gerrymandering?
</p>

<h4> Texas</h4>
<p>
When the Republicans famously gerrymandered Texas 
in 2003,
this altered the number of Texas congressmen from
17 Dem &amp; 15 Repub, to 11 Dem &amp; 21 Repub,
i.e. 6 out of 32 seats changed party hands.
</p>
<h4> Pennsylvania</h4>
<p>
Also (somewhat less famously)
after the 2000 Census the Republican Party made no secret of their intention
to redraw voting districts in Pennsylvania to get rid of Democratic Party 
congressional seats.   They used "packing" (pack many Democratic voters
into one district),
"cracking" (divide the Democratic voters into several
districts so they cannot win),
and "kidnapping" (place two incumbent
Democratic congressmen into the same district so at most 
one can now win).
Republican leaders Tom DeLay (majority leader)
and Dennis Hastert (speaker)
sent a letter to the PA state legislators saying
"We wish to encourage you in these efforts, as they play a crucial role in 
maintaining a Republican majority in the United States House of Representatives."
The resulting districts then garnered such approbations as the "supine seahorse"
and the "upside-down Chinese dragon."

With the percent of Pennsylvanians in each party nearly unchanged, 
the minority (Republican) party (41% of registered voters, loser of
Governor election) got 63% of 
the seats in Congress. 
Were it not for the nearly universal 
outcry of voters in Northeast PA and a mere 3% Democratic edge in District 
17 the result would have been as predicted and planned by the Republicans 
&ndash; they would have gotten 74% of the seats in the 108th congress.

The Republicans maintained that the districts were very accurate according 
to the &quot;one person one vote&quot; principle. 
That's correct; 
the district populations varied by only one in 646,371 persons. 
While this is an amazing feat, it belies the fact that
<i>the party picked the voters and not the other way around</i>.

<h4> North Carolina &ndash; Study Shows Gerrymandering Distorts Election Results </h4>
<p><small>
This section extracted virtually verbatim from a news story by
Taegan Goddard on politicalwire.com 29 November 2014.
</small>

<p>
In a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8796">new study</a>, Duke University researchers 
Jonathan Mattingly and Christy Vaughn created a random series of North Carolina 
congressional district maps using the same vote totals from 2012, but with different borders, 
<a href="GerryNC.html">North Carolina Public Radio</a>
reports. 
</p><p>
After re-running the election 100 times with a randomly drawn maps, the simulated election 
results found Democrats winning an average of 7.6 House seats out of 13. In fact, 95% of 
the random redistricting simulations found Democrats winning between 6 and 9 House seats. 
These finds are in stark contrast with the 4 Democrats &amp; 9 Republicans
actually elected in the 2012 elections
with the same vote counts.   [More North Carolinians voted for Democrats than Republicans.]
</p><p>
WDS comments:
The "random" districts were drawn by computer to obey NC laws
and subjectively resembled the official districts in terms of general appearance, but
were of course unbiased since based on random decisions by computer.
Of 300 random maps, it turned out every one elected at least 2 more Democrats than the 
official map did.  In other words, if those gerrymandering NC had used this
computer program to generate the 300 maps then chosen
the one most-benefiting Republicans, that would have been exceedingly biased of them.
But still not even close to as biased as what they actually did.
</p>

<h4> Florida</h4>

<p>
Florida in 2000 was famously almost exactly even in their vote for Bush versus Gore
and "should" have been even.
But the district lines the Republicans drew after the 2000 census resulted in
Florida sending 18 Republicans and 7 Democrats to the House.
</p>

<h4> Michigan</h4>

<p>
Michigan in 2000 was won by Gore.
After the Michigan gerrymandering plan was approved on 11 September 2001
(a famous date for a rather different reason...  which 
conveniently prevented this from
getting much publicity) it got 60% Republican Congressmen versus 40% Democrats
(despite the Democrat candidates getting 35000 more votes) in 2002.
(Previously the state had 56.3% Democratic congresmen and 43.7% Republican.)
</p>

<!--
These figures probably slightly underestimate the effect of gerrymandering,
because the Republicans became unpopular during the 2nd G.W.Bush administration
and hence presumably gained fewer seats than they would have expected.
<h4> Ohio </h4>

CONGRESSIONAL RACES
District lines in Ohio foil Democrats
Sunday, December 03, 2006
JONATHAN RISKIND AND JIM SIEGEL
THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH:
While Democrats won nearly 53 percent of the congressional votes statewide, only about 
39 percent of Ohioans will be represented next year by Democrats in Congress.  (Stats from
2006 midterm elections.)

<h3> Summary</h3>

<p>
The preceding four GOP gerrymanders (I've omitted NC, since that was not a
"before versus after" comparison, but rather a "gerrymander versus random maps" comparison;
but if it were included it would only strengthen our claim)
had this effect:

<tr><th>Before gerrymandering (1999)</th><th>After gerrymandering</th></tr>

<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">91 seats occupied 34.1% by Democrats</td>

<i>
In total &ndash; and putting in a 1&sigma; statistical error bar: 
<b>(18.5 &plusmn; 4.2)%</b> of the congressional 
House seats change hands upon gerrymandering
in 2000-era USA.
</i>
</big>
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, Senators and the Presidency are <i>unaffected</i> by gerrymandering
&ndash; although recently an effort, 
funded by millions of out-of-state dollars provided through front organizations,
was made to try to get California to apportion its electors 
by congressional <i>district</i>.  This plan <i>would</i> gerrymander the presidency,
but the referendum failed.  (As of 2006 only Nebraska and Maine
decide their electors in this manner.)
The funding was done in such a way as
to make it untraceable and evade CA funding-disclosure laws
for referenda.
But ultimately much of the funding <i>was</i> traced and found
to originate from 
New York Republican multimillionaire (and affiliate of US-presidential-candidate-Giuliani) 
Howard Rich, who donated at least $2.3 million through multiple front groups
such as
"Americans for Limited Government (AFLG),"
"Club for State Growth Action" [Rich is president, same address as AFLG],
"Montanans in Action" [funded by FfD],
"Colorado at its Best" [Rich is director, same address as AFLG],
"Protect our Homes Coalition,"
and the
"Fund for Democracy (FfD)" [located at Rich's address in NY].
Several other people closely connected to Giuliani also participated heavily in the effort.
</p><p>
It also should be remarked that we on this page have intentionally only discussed US states 
gerrymandered by the Republicans.   There also are states gerrymandered by Democrats; and
(probably the most common of the three types)
states gerrymandered by both parties acting in cooperation to make sure that
"everybody has a safe seat" so that voters can have no effect.   The latter is
called "bipartisan gerrymandering."  The reason we only looked at Republican 
gerrymandering on this
page is that allowed us to make numerical estimates of how much it shifts things.
