<H2> Why Libertarians need range voting (Executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Range Voting would have gotten Libertarian 2004 Presidential
candidate Michael Badnarik 22 times more votes than he got under
plurality
and 15 times as many as he would have gotten under Approval Voting
(relative to Bush &amp; Kerry).
</li>
<li>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)
would be a huge mistake for libertarians since it just <a href="TarrIrv.html">leads</a>
to 2-party domination
just like the plurality system.
</li>
<li>
Without a change in the voting system to get rid of Duverger's law
of 2-party domination, Libertarians and all third-party candidates will
forever have no chance.  There is not a single third-party
member of the House, Senate, or high Executive branch  (zero out of
about 600 people).
</li>
<li>
So it is a matter of survival: you must push range voting.
</li>
</ol>
