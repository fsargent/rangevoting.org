<H1> Honeybees use range voting &ndash; executive summary </H1>

<ul><li>
Scientists analysing video
footage have shown that <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>
 has been used in <i>hundreds of trillions</i>
of elections held by social insects
(honeybees and ants) to select nest locations.  
</li><li>
The bees' decision-making process can be interpreted almost exactly as "range voting with intentional blanks,"
albeit implemented with a rather clever and nonobvious algorithm.
</li><li>
That's far more democracy experience that humanity has ever
had (also more than computers can simulate).  
</li><li>
Biologists regard <a href="LAlbipennis.html">ants</a> as the most successful land animal ever
and the evidence from entomological observations and computer simulations is that honeybee 
elections select the objectively best candidate <i>&asymp;3 times more often</i> (90% versus 32%)
than human elections (with comparable numbers of candidates and voters) would.  
</li><li>
That's mainly because of the flaws in the "plurality voting system" currently most prevalent among humans.
