RangeVoting.org - Delayed versus Instant runoff, reasons behind differences

<H2> Why does Instant Runoff
<a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">lead</a>
to 2-party domination, while (delayed) Top-Two Runoff 
leads to multiparties? </H2>

<p>
We don't completely
know why.
But here are some factors that probably have something to do with the answer.
Probably the first and last ones are the major reason, but the middle ones
are at least related.

In a 3-candidate IRV election, if voters strategically
rank the two major-party candidates top and bottom
to try to maximize their vote's impact (and we claim real world voters will do that
a lot of the time, no matter how many IRV advocates tell them not to; 80-95% of 
Australian IRV voters exhibit this sort of behavior)
then <i>theorem:</i>  the same winner will be elected as strategic voters
("always vote for a major-party candidate so as not to waste my vote")
would have elected under plain old plurality voting.  This is a major defect in IRV
and a big reason IRV leads (experimentally), 
just like plurality voting, to 2-party domination.
</td>
<td>
With T2R in a 3-candidate election, strategic voters will <i>not</i> necessarily
elect the same winner  as the strategic-voter plain-plurality-voting
winner.  (Because of the second round, featuring honest voting only.)
This is a major success of T2R and 
a big part of the reason it experimentally (in the <a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">countries</a> in which T2R is used)
leads to multiparties and avoids
2-party domination.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is a <a href="TTRvsIRVrevdata.html">fact</a>
that the "flip rate" of T2R winners away from plain-plurality winners is over 3 times
IRV's flip rate.

Good IRV voter strategy can involve dishonesty about pair-comparisons occurring 
in <i>every</i> IRV round.  <a href="IRVpartic.html">Often</a>, 
it is strategically good to "betray" your favorite
third-party candidate by not voting him top.
In contrast, in top-two runoff, voting for the third-party true favorite
usually won't hurt you in the first round, since that way he may make it
to the second round and the honesty of voters in that second round may suffice
to elect him; whereas if he fails to make it, then usually the major-party
candidates will make it and you'll still have the opportunity to
vote honestly on them next round.
</td>
<td>
Good T2R voter strategy is always to be <i>honest</i> in the second (final) round.
However, T2R voters might reasonably choose to be dishonest in the first round by intentionally
voting for somebody horrible:
If it's A versus B versus C with
the other candidates D,E,... unlikely to make it into the second round;
you want A and are fairly confident A is going to be in first-place in the initial round;
and you are fairly confident either B or A would beat the horrible C
in a head-to-head runoff; then your best strategy is to vote C.

IRV can involve a very large number of rounds.
</td>

T2R only involves 2 rounds.  So the two are not equivalent even for "honest" voters.
(Also a different set of voters might participate in the second round, another kind
of inequivalence.)

IRV elects a winner different from the plain plurality
winner <a href="TTRvsIRVrevdata.html">about</a> 5.8% of the time,
but T2R differs from plurality about 16% of the time.
(And, of course, plain plurality is <a href="Duverger.html">well known</a>
to yield 2-party domination.)
</td>

With T2R, Prof. Steven J. Brams speculates that the "underdog effect" may be the reason
more plurality-winners are overturned by the runoff.
("Underdog effect" = "The desire to vote for an expected loser.")
Brams refers to chapter 3 of
his book <i>Paradoxes in politics: an introduction to the nonobvious in political science</i> 
(Free Press, 1976) for discussion.

With IRV,
if the top two vote-getters from the first round include the Condorcet ("beats-all")

In IRV, 2-party domination causes the media to focus mainly on the candidates from the two 
major parties, which reinforces... 2-party domination!
</td>
<td>
In T2R <a href="TTRvIRVstats.html">countries</a>, 
(a) the media often runs polls of the form "in a hypothetical 2-contender runoff 
between X and Y,
who would you vote for?"  which often generates
media focus on good third-party candidates.
And (b) if a third-party candidate does manage to make it into the second round, the
media gives plenty of attention to both from then on, 
giving the third-party one an equal shot.

<H2> Let's explore an explicit numerical example </H2>

<p>
Suppose A and B are the major party candidates and C the third party.
To avoid the possible IRV "C is spoiler" scenario 
voters who honestly favor C, instead <i>strategically exaggerate</i>
to vote either A or B top (and the other
one bottom), with C middle, in IRV.
(Voters know from
past experience that the IRV spoiler scenario occurs with probability considerably greater
than the historical probability C will win &ndash;
<a href="IRVStratPf.html">probability estimates</a> &ndash;
and <a href="IRVpartic.html">here</a>
and 
<a href="IRVcs.html">here</a> are
typical IRV spoiler scenarios
intended to be simple, whereas
<a href="TarrIrv.html">this one</a> is intended to be realistic
of the sort that arises in "1-dimensional politics.")

</p>
<p>
Suppose the electorate's honest votes would be
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 16 </td>
<td align="center">  C>A>B </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 17 </td>
<td align="center">  C>B>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 35 </td>
<td align="center">  A>C>B   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 32 </td>
<td align="center">   B>C>A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
where the bottom two lines are due to most A- or B-supporters
viewing C as the "lesser evil,"  e.g. consider that C is a "centrist."
</p>

<p>
Then the strategic IRV votes are:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 51 </td>
<td align="center">  A>C>B </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 49 </td>
<td align="center">  B>C>A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
And <b>A wins</b>.
This illustrates the damning fact that
with strategic voters (who act this way) in a 3-candidate
election, the IRV winner is always the same as the plurality
(strategic voter) winner.
</p>

<p>
(And no matter what IRV advocates say, I'll still believe 
based on my polling experience that a lot of voters are 
going to act this way.  Believe it.  It is <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">reality</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The top-2-runoff voters vote (in the first round):
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 33 </td>
<td align="center">  C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 35 </td>
<td align="center">  A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 32 </td>
<td align="center">   B </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
and then in the second round it is A versus C and
of course strategic and honest voting are the same thing in
this round, so
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 65 </td>
<td align="center">  C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 35 </td>
<td align="center">  A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
And <b>C wins</b> hugely.
This illustrates the fact that with strategic voters, 3-candidate
IRV and T2R elections are
<i>not</i> the same thing, and T2R <i>can</i> elect third-party candidates.
</p>

<p>
Of course in our analysis above, we were assuming the first-round T2R voters
voted honestly.
Thinking strategically, the A-supporters based on history figure the main
threat is B.  They will vote A, or conceivably (if they are 
convinced A is going to make it to the 2nd round regardless) they might vote C.
Same reasoning reversed applies to the B-supporters.  
Finally, the C-supporters figure C has little chance but can
only get a chance if they vote C; and if C does not
make it to the second round, then fine with them, they'll be able to 
express their A versus B preference next round and haven't hurt themselves.
All of these strategic considerations only make everything
we just said <i>more true</i> &ndash; i.e. C will win <i>even more</i>.
</p>

<p>
This kind of scenario and voter thinking
presumably happens often enough to account
for the <a href="HonestRunoff.html#mainr">observed fact</a>
that IRV countries are 2-party dominated 
(in IRV seats) whereas T2R countries have multiparties.
