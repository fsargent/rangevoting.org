Third time's a charm for final approval of instant runoff pilots</H3>

RALEIGH, N.C. &ndash; The House needed three tries to finally get a bill
through Wednesday that allows up to 20 communities to operate &quot;instant
runoff&quot; elections through 2008.</p><p>The bill, which also pushed back by three weeks the date of the primary
runoff date for legislative and statewide elections during
even-numbered years, now goes to Gov. Mike Easley for his signature.</p><p>&quot;This thing's like a vampire, it just won't die,&quot; said Rep. Tim Moore, R-Cleveland, before the measure finally passed 60-51.</p><p>The House narrowly rejected twice this week a Senate version of the
measure creating the pilot in which voters in local elections to rank
their order of preference among the candidates.</p><p>It's meant as a way to improve voter participation and reduce expensive
runoff elections. No county will be forced to participate.</p><p>&quot;There won't be any local instant runoff voting if the counties don't
agree to do that,&quot; said Rep. Deborah Ross, D-Wake, who supported the
bill.</p><p>The defeats - first Monday and then Wednesday - left the future of the
bill in doubt with the General Assembly expecting to adjourn this week.
But lawmakers each time voted to reconsider the measure.</p>
<p><font color="#880000">In an instant runoff, voters would be allowed to rank their order of
preference among the candidates. The first choices of voters initially
would be tallied. If the leading candidate failed to win more than 40
percent of the first-choice votes, the top two candidates would advance
to the runoff.</p><p>Election officials would then examine the ballots of voters whose
preferred candidate was eliminated. The remaining candidates would get
votes for being the highest-ranked alternative choice. Those votes
would be added to their original tally and the candidate with the most
total votes would win.</font></p>
<p>House Republican Leader Joe Kiser, R-Lincoln, urged colleagues to
reject the plan. Opponents say the measure would change campaign
strategy and confuse voters.</p><p>&quot;This is a drastic change in which we hold our elections in North Carolina,&quot; Kiser said. &quot;It will change us forever.&quot;</p><p>Rep. Paul Luebke, D-Durham, successfully pleaded with the House to approve the bill once and for all.</p><p>&quot;I think we've had enough debate on this,&quot; he said.</p>
