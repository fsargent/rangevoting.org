<H1> Why score voting should decrease the importance of money in elections </H1>

<p>
If <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>
were adopted, then it automatically would decrease the
importance of money.
We first must ask the underlying question:
<i>why</i> is campaigning so absurdly expensive?  When today's technology makes it easy 
and cheap to publicize your message?  The reason is that
</p><ol><li>
if you vote for Ralph Nader, you are, strategically speaking, an idiot.
Hence it does not
matter that Nader can make
his message available, nor whether that message is good &ndash; 
still few will vote for him.
Studies showed <i>90%</i> of voters who regarded Nader &amp; Buchanan as the best
US presidential candidate in 2000, voted for somebody else.
That's an insurmountable hurdle
for everybody like Nader and an enormous distortion of
democracy.
</li><li>
The reason for that is the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting system's "wasted
vote" mathematical pathology...
</li><li>
which does not exist with the "score voting" superior system...
</li><li>
in which there is no such thing as "vote splitting" and "wasted vote"
hence <i>no inherent strategic need for candidates to expensively convince
voters they are one of the "2 most likely to win" so that it is 
non-idiotic to vote for them.</i>
Instead, voters can, with no idiocy at all, just score the good candidates high,
not caring one whit about how much money they have or how likely or
unlikely they are to win.
</li></ol><p>
This all is a fact which the media virtually <i>never</i> talks about.
Indeed they virtually never mention
the importance of other voting systems even when it is staring them in
the face, such as
Donald Trump and Arnold Schwarzenegger
(<a href="Trump2015.html">/Trump2015.html</a>).
In those cases, the entire real story was the voting system, but the media would
simply not talk about that actual story.
Not even for 1 sentence.
</p><p>
The strategy to stop money-corruption of politics must be <b>2-pronged:</b>
not only try to get money out of
politics &ndash; a noble idea, but one which nobody has managed to do in
200 years of US history and even if done would be very vulnerable to cheating and
backsliding and the fact the FEC almost never enforces even the lame laws
we do have &ndash; but <i>inherently decrease the importance of money</i>.
The latter idea
is one almost nobody in the media talks about, 
and hence almost nobody knows about.
(And if money mattered little, then
that'd remove the incentive for cheating, partially solving the cheating and
non-enforcement problems.)
