<H2> What is a "vote"? </H2>

<p>
A &quot;Vote&quot; is an expression of your opinion about the available choices. 
</p>

<p>
Sadly,
many Americans have become <i>brainwashed</i> into believing that the only possible 
kind of vote is
"please name exactly one candidate, then shut up."  
(That kind of voting is called the
"plurality system.")
This is an incredibly bad kind of vote because you only get to give information
about <i>one</i> of the candidates, i.e. the minimum amount of information you
possibly could provide.  It is as if this system was intentionally
designed to minimize your
input rather than to maximize it.
</p>

<p>
But other, more <b>expressive</b> kinds of votes are possible!
One kind, advocated by J.C. de Borda in 1781 and
(used in a different manner) by the Marquis de Condorcet in 1785,
is a <i>rank ordering of the candidates.</i>
For example, if the candidates were Alice, Bob, and Cathy, you
could order them   Alice&gt;Bob&gt;Cathy, meaning Alice (in your
opinion) is the best.  
That is much better because you get to give information about your feelings
about more than just one candidate!  
But this kind of voting still is not as good as it could be:
<ol>
<li>
You cannot express <i>ignorance</i> about a candidate.
(Maybe you know nothing about Bob whatever.  Why are you being forced to guess?)
</li>
<li>
You cannot express the view that two candidates are <i>equal</i>;
you are forced by the rules of this system to rank one above the other.
</li>
<li>
Although you can express the view that Alice is better than Bob, you cannot express 
the <i>intensity</i> of that preference.  Maybe you think Alice is
better than Bob, but Bob is really, really a <i>lot</i> better than Adolf Hitler.
Sorry, can't say that in your Borda-style vote!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Range voting</i> overcomes all those problems --
you can express ignorance (leave it blank), you can express 
different intensities of preferences (vote Alice=100, Bob=90, and Hitler=0), you
can express equality (make the numbers equal),
and you get all this expressiveness very simply.
</p>

<H2> Is this constitutional? Yes! </H2>

<p> The 
<a href="USconstitution.txt">
US constitution</a> was written in 1787 and ratified along with the Bill of Rights
in 1791. It <i>nowhere</i> says that a "vote" has to consist of "the name of 
exactly one candidate, then shut up."
In fact it nowhere defines "vote," although it mentions votes about 20 times.
</p>

<p> 
The constitution is rife with such ambiguities and that was usually
<i>intentional.</i>  We at the Center for Range Voting
believe that it was also intentional in this case:  the authors of
the constitution <i>intentionally wanted</i> to allow
other kinds of voting than just plurality voting; they <i>knew</i> there were
other kinds of voting and <i>intentionally chose</i>  not to forbid them;
and they intentionally remained agnostic on the question of what kind of voting system to use.
</p>

<p>
Why do we say that?  Because we know that Thomas Jefferson,
Edmund Randolph, and James Madison all owned copies of Condorcet's book!
In fact Jefferson bought copies of everything by Condorcet he could get his hands on, and
in at least one case, he <i>annotated</i> his copy, and he was so enthusiastic that
he sent copies to Randolph and Madison.  
We also know that John Adams was 
<a href="VenHist.html#adams">familiar</a> with the mechanisms used by the Venetians.
This all happened <i>before</i>
constitutional ratification in 1791.
And we know that Benjamin Franklin apparently knew Condorcet personally
(both were high in the French Academy of Sciences) and indeed Condorcet gave a warm
<i>elogy</i> for Franklin upon the latter's death.
And, Jefferson knew Borda too, since he mentioned him in a letter he wrote,
and <a href="ConstVt.html#jc">both</a> Jefferson and Adams "met Condorcet on several occasions."
(Also Borda was a military hero in the American Revolution.)
</p>

<p>
So while perhaps Jefferson et al did not fully
follow Condorcet's mathematically intricate arguments, it
is absolutely inconceivable that they did not grasp his 
fundamental starting point that
rank-ordering-type votes were to be used in his (and Borda's) 
voting systems.  And it also is absolutely inconceivable that they did not realize
that there was an acrimonious conflict between Condorcet and Borda over whose voting
system was better, i.e. they realized the question of which voting system was best,
was not a trivial one and the answer was not clear.
</p>

<p>
And other voting systems besides plurality have <i>already been</i> used
for various state governor and other high positions at various times and
places throughout US history.  The <i>cumulative</i> system
used to be used in Illinois to elect representatives; it involved votes which were
integer vectors summing to a constant (your vote could express opinions about more than one
candidate in this system).  The <i>Bucklin</i> system was used 
in various state primary and mayoral elections in the early 1900s.  It involved rank-ordering
(Borda-style) votes.
We don't recommend those two systems, but they make it clear
there is plenty of precedent in US history for other kinds of votes!
