<H2> Example of Instant Runoff Voting insanity </H2>

<p>
Let there be 15 voters and  four candidates named A, B, C, and D.
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center"> A>D>C>B </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center"> B>D>C>A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center"> C>D>A>B </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center"> D>A>B>C </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center"> A>C>B>D </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center"> B>C>D>A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center"> C>B>D>A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center"> C>D>B>A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center"> D>B>C>A </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
With <a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff (IRV)</a> voting,
<b>A wins</b> this election.
(First D is eliminated, then C, then B.)
Thus IRV is saying that 
A is the best candidate, followed by B, C, and D in that order.
</p>

<p>
But now suppose C drops out.
Now the results are completely reversed: 
<b>D wins</b>, followed by
B and A.
</p>
<p>
If instead B drops out, then
<b>D wins</b>, followed by
C and A.
</p>
<p>
Finally if A drops out, then
<b>D wins</b>, followed by
C and B.
</p>
<p>
In short, Instant Runoff says A>B>C>D &ndash;
but if anybody besides D drops out, then it orders the candidates in exactly reversed order.
IRV can say somebody is the best candidate, 
then <a href="IrvRevFail.html">turn around</a>
and say that same person is the worst.
It must have been wrong at least one of those times.
And the consequence can be that we elect the worst 
instead of the best candidate, which is very bad news for your country.
</p>
<p>
You might want to consider 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> instead.
</p>
<p>
<small>
Actually in this election, there are good arguments that <b>D</b> is the best (not the worst
as IRV says) candidate: namely D beats every rival pairwise by at least a 9-to-6 majority
and D also is the <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a> winner and the winner with
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting if each voter approves her top-two choices.
You can also <a href="PlurBadRemove.html">see</a> a related insanity but 
instead for plurality voting, and <a href="rangeVborda.html#JohnsonEx">another</a>
of similar ilk for Borda voting.
