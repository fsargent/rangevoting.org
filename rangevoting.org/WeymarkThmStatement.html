Weymark's Statement of Harsanyi's Social Aggregation Theorem
</H2>

<p><small>By Marcus Pivato.
This is simply theorem 8 from
John A. Weymark: The Harsanyi-Sen Debate on utilitarianism, in
"Interpersonal Comparisons of Well-Being," 
(Jon Elster &amp; John E. Roemer, eds, Cambridge Univ. Press 1991), 
but rewritten to condense it into a single theorem rather than with
different parts spread over many theorems.

<p>
<b>THEOREM:</b>
</p><p>
Let X be a set of two or more "alternatives" and let Lott(X) be the set of all "lotteries"
(i.e. probability distributions) over X.  
</p><p>
Let I be a collection of individuals, and suppose each individual i in I has 
von Neumann Morgenstern ("vNM") preferences over Lott(X) &ndash; i.e. 
there is some utility function U<sub>i</sub>: X &rarr; <b>R</b> such that i 
prefers lottery p to lottery q iff the p-expected value of U<sub>i</sub> 
is bigger than the q-expected value of U<sub>i</sub>. 
</p><P>
Suppose "Society" also has vNM preferences over Lott(X), described by
some utility function U: X &rarr; <b>R</b>.
</p><P>
<b>(a)</b>
Suppose Society's preferences satisfy "Pareto Indifference":
For any p and q in Lott(X), if every person is indifferent
between p and q, then so is Society.  Then U is a <i>linear combination</i> of
{ U<sub>i</sub> ; i in I}.  That is, there are some coefficients a<sub>i</sub> in <b>R</b>
(not necessarily positive) such that
<center>
 U =  &sum;<sub>i in I</sub> a<sub>i</sub> U<sub>i</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (plus some constant).
</center>
</p><P>
<b>(b)</b>
Suppose Society's preferences also satisfy "Semistrong Pareto":
For any p and q in Lott(X), if every person thinks p is at least
as good as q, then so does Society.
</p><P>
Then U is a linear combination of {U<sub>i</sub>}, 
and furthermore the coefficients a<sub>i</sub> are <i>nonnegative</i>.
</p><P>
<b>(c)</b>
Suppose further that  Society's preferences satisfy "Strong Pareto":
This is the same condition as "Semistrong Pareto" with the further requirement: 
"if everyone thinks p is as good as q, and at least one thinks p is better, 
then Society thinks p is better than q."
</p><P>
Then U is a linear combination of {U<sub>i</sub>}, 
and furthermore the coefficients a<sub>i</sub> are <i>positive</i>.
</p><P>
<b>(d)</b>
In any of parts (a), (b), or (c), suppose Society's preferences also satisfy 
"Independent prospects":
For every individual i in I, there exist two lotteries p and q such that i prefers p to q, 
but everyone else is indifferent between p and q 
(i.e. p and q concern some matter affecting i only).
</p><P>
Then the coefficients a<sub>i</sub> are
<i>unique</i> up to multiplication by some constant rescaling factor.
