<H2> Rob Richie gets it wrong about Louisiana Governor Race 2015 </H2>
<p>Warren D. Smith, 29 Nov. 2015.</p>

This concerns the article
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-richie/did-louisiana-just-elect_b_8641650.html">
Did Louisiana Just Elect 'Wrong' Governor Due to Flaw in Top 2 Runoff Method?</a>,
by Rob Richie (head of the Instant Runoff Voting propaganda organization "FairVote"), 
Huffpost 24 Nov 2015.
</p><p>
We point out that a better title would have been "Rob Richie wrong about wrong governor."
</p><h3>
Rob Richie's claims:
</h3><p><b>1.</b>
 On 23 November 2015,
Democrat John Bel Edwards won the 2-man runoff against Republican U.S Senator 
David Vitter by 56.1% to 43.9%.
</p><p><b>2.</b>
 RR says it is "quite likely that either of the other two Republicans in that first 
round in October would have defeated Edwards."  This first round, held 24 Oct. 2015, was:
</p><pre>
  <b>J. Bel Edwards  (Dem)  39.9%</b>
  David Vitter    (Rep)  23.0%
  Scott Angelle   (Rep)  19.3%
  Jay Dardenne    (Rep)  15.0%
  Cary Deaton     (Dem)   1.1%
  S.L. Simpson    (Dem)   0.7%
  Beryl Billiot   (Ind)   0.5%
  Jeremy W. Odom  (Ind)   0.4% 
  Eric P. Orgeron (Ind)   0.2%
</pre><p>
"Vitter was getting the most votes among Republicans, but...  was also the 
weakest Republican candidate when paired against Edwards and also lost when 
matched one-on-one against either of his fellow Republicans."
That claim was based on  Clarus Research Group (pollster)  head-to-head race polls finding
</p><pre>
  Vitter (R) 41  vs  Edwards  (D) 45
  Vitter (R) 35  vs  Angelle  (R) 40
  Vitter (R) 35  vs  Dardenne (R) 42
</pre><p>
reported in this 27 sept 2015 news story
<a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/13542209-123/poll-among-david-vitter-john">
http://theadvocate.com/news/13542209-123/poll-among-david-vitter-john</a>
(800 likely voters, claimed "margin of error" &plusmn;3.46%),
and on these pairwise results from a PPP poll released 24 Sept:
</p><pre>
   Vitter   (R) 38  vs  Edwards (D) 50
   Angelle  (R) 40  vs  Edwards (D) 40
   Dardenne (R) 42  vs  Edwards (D) 40
   <a href="assets/documents/LouisianaPollSeptember2015.pdf">LouisianaPollSeptember2015.pdf</a>
</pre><p>
</p><p><b>3.</b>
 Richie does not mention this, but that same PPP poll (616 likely voters, 21-22 sept 2015,
claimed "margin of error" &plusmn;4%)
also did an <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> subpoll.
And the same Clarus poll cited by Richie
went 
<a href="http://www.wwltv.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/28/wwl-tvadvocate-poll-analyzing-answers-on-gov-candidates--character/73006542/">further</a> by reporting 
<a href="Rangevoting.html">score voting</a> ratings on a 
"very favorable" (VF),
"somewhat favorable" (SF),
"somewhat unfavorable" (SU),
"very unfavorable" (VU) 4-level scale.
</p><pre>
                PPP        CLARUS    Mean Clarus
   CANDIDATE  fav/unfv  VF,SF,SU,VU    score
   <b>Edwards</b>     <b>35/27</b>    11,28,10,5%    <b>1.833</b>
   Dardenne    33/32    10,33,10,5     1.828
   Angelle     29/29    10,29,10,6     1.782
   Vitter      34/51    13,32,16,28    1.337
</pre><p>
PPP found Edwards would have been the approval voting winner,
while Clarus found Edwards would have been the score voting winner.
These findings, however, were damaging to the theory Richie was trying to fabricate (even though
the PPP approval voting results actually were <i>more</i> convincing than 
the data from the <i>same</i> poll that Richie did use) so as 
usual whenever that happens, Richie ignored them.
</p><p><b>4.</b>
 Richie then figured that if IRV (instant runoff voting)
with full rank ordering ballots had been used,
Angelle would have gone ahead of Vitter thanks to vote transfers from Dardenne, 
thereupon likely winning against Edwards.   The first part of that theory 
(Angelle beating Vitter)  indeed is supported  by Richie's poll data.
The second part (Angelle beating Edwards) however, is a 50-50 coin toss based on the 
poll data Richie was able to find.  Therefore for that part Richie 
ignored his own data and simply based it on "Republicans now typically [win]
in statewide offices in Louisiana."
</p><p>
   Richie then concludes "John Bel Edwards should be congratulated
for winning his election under the 'Top Two' runoff rules used in Louisiana. 
Second, Edwards almost certainly owes his victory to a flaw in those rules..."
He then urges that Louisiana switch from top-2 to IRV.
</p>
<h3>Analysis:</h3>
<p><b>5.</b>
However, Richie forgets to mention that actually the very polls he himself cited showed
Edwards was the correct winner with approval voting, and with score voting,
both of which are systems with
<a href="BayRegsFig.html">lower Bayesian Regret</a> than IRV. 
</p><p>
Oops.
</p><p><b>6.</b>
Also, let us ask ourselves the following.  Suppose a professional 
statistician had the very same poll data Richie examined, showing
Edwards was the approval-voting winner, and score-voting winner, and showing pairwise results 
</p><center>
   Vitter    38  vs  Edwards  50; &nbsp;&nbsp;
   Angelle   40  vs  Edwards  40; &nbsp;&nbsp;
   Dardenne  42  vs  Edwards  40
</center><p>
(with claimed margin of error &plusmn;4%).
Would any professional statistician on the planet have concluded from this
that it was "almost certain"
that Edwards would have been defeated?  Then still kept his job?
</p><p>
And Richie also concluded it was 
"quite likely that <i>either</i> of the other two Republicans in that first 
round in October would have defeated Edwards."  
(My italics.) Again: would any
professional statistician on the planet have concluded that
and still kept his job?  The answer, I hope, is "no."  In fact, the chance
"either Republican would have defeated Edwards" is actually about 30% based on Richie's own data,
which is <i>not</i>
"quite likely," and the chance Richie's whole theory that Angelle would with IRV
have defeated Edwards, is <i>not</i>
"almost certain," it is "less than 50%."  These are mathematical
facts, based on Richie's own poll data.
</p><p><b>7.</b>
And there actually is more poll data, and more recent poll data,
available than the data Richie cited.  What does it say?
</p><p>
Here's a <a href="Rangevoting.html">score voting</a> statewide telephone poll by
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/286105391/LA-Gov-Market-Research-Insight-Oct-2015">Market Research Insight</a> 15-19 Oct 2015 using
scores 
"very favorable" (VF),
"somewhat favorable" (SF),
"somewhat unfavorable" (SU),
"very unfavorable" (VU) and "don't know" (x).
I will calculate mean score based on a (3,2,1,0) numeric scale for (VF,SF,SU,VU):
</p><table>
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>Candidate</th><th>Scores (VF,SF,SU,VU,x)</th><th>Mean Score</th></tr>
<tr><td>J. Bel <b>Edwards</b></td><td>(128,137,60,67,208)</td><td><b>1.83</b></td></tr>
<!-- (128*3+137*2+60)/(128+137+60+67) -->
<tr><td>Scott Angelle</td><td>(61,196,51,58,234)</td><td>1.71</td></tr>
<!-- (61*3+196*2+51)/(61+196+51+58) -->
<tr><td>David Vitter</td><td>(74,144,83,177,122)</td><td>1.24</td></tr>
<!-- (74*3+144*2+83)/(74+144+83+177) -->
</table>
<p>
An independent 
<a href="Rangevoting.html">score voting</a> statewide telephone poll 
was done by  Harper Polling (612 likely voters, Oct. 16-17, percentages given
unlike above poll where counts given):
</p><table>
<tr bgcolor="orange"><th>Candidate</th><th>Scores (VF,SF,SU,VU,x)</th><th>Mean Score</th></tr>
<tr><td>J. Bel <b>Edwards</b></td><td>(35,26,15,14,11)</td><td><b>1.89</b></td></tr>
<!-- (35*3+26*2+15)/(36+26+15+14) -->
<tr><td>Scott Angelle</td><td>(16,28,23,14,19)</td><td>1.57</td></tr>
<!-- (16*3+28*2+23)/(16+28+23+14) -->
<tr><td>Jay Dardenne</td><td>(18,27,25,15,15)</td><td>1.56</td></tr>
<!-- (18*3+27*2+25)/(18+27+25+15) -->
<tr><td>David Vitter</td><td>(21,15,18,38,8)</td><td>1.21</td></tr>
<!-- (21*3+15*2+18)/(21+15+18+38) -->
</table>
<p>
Keep in mind that 
<a href="Rangevoting.html">score voting</a> 
is the best voting system discussed here, with 
<a href="BayRegsFig.html">lowest Bayesian Regret</a>,
and that the election was held 24 Oct.
</p>

<h3> Revised conclusion </h3>

<p>
Edwards fully deserved his victory under the "top two runoff" method, as is shown
by two score voting polls both more recent, and more convincing, than the polls Richie misused;
and also by the same polls Richie used (but Richie ignored these inconvenient 
data within his own polls).
Although top two runoff indeed has its "flaws," they were not in this election responsible
for a "wrong governor."
Richie employed standard techniques from the book "How to lie with statistics" by
Darrell Huff, such as cherrypicking his data, ignoring even the data he did cite whenever it
disagreed with the conclusion he wanted to reach, and using utterly unjustified phrases 
like "almost certain."  However, in addition to being an incompetent and fraudulent statistician,
Richie also wasn't even a very good liar, because even the most crude and shallow attempt to
check his facts was enough to refute him &ndash; had HuffPost bothered to do 
even a crude fact check (which obviously, they didn't).  In particular it took
me less than a single day to write this (the same day I first saw Richie's article).
