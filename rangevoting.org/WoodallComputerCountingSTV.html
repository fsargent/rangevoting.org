<H2>Computer counting in STV elections</h2>

<h4>D R Woodall, Department of Mathematics, University of Nottingham</h4>

<p>
Douglas Woodall is Reader in Pure Mathematics at Nottingham University.

<p>
<i>Reprinted [with minor corrections] from Representation 23 (1983), 4-6.</i>

<p>
The Single Transferable Vote is by far and away the fairest form of
electoral system. Nevertheless, when the counting in STV elections is
carried out by hand, rather arbitrary decisions have to be made in order to
simplify the count, and these introduce anomalies. Although small in
comparison with anomalies present in other electoral systems, these
anomalies may affect the result, and are certainly annoying to the purist.

<p>
The biggest anomaly is caused by the decision, always made, not to transfer
votes to candidates who have already reached the quota of votes necessary
for election. This means that the way in which a given voter's vote will be
assigned may depend on the order in which candidates are declared elected or
eliminated during the counting, and it can lead to the following form of
tactical voting by those who understand the system. If it is possible to
identify a candidate W who is sure to be eliminated early (say, the
Cambridge University Raving Loony Party candidate), then a voter can
increase the effect of his genuine second choice by putting W first. For
example, if two voters both want A as first choice and B as second, and A
happens to be declared elected on the first count, then the voter who lists
his choices as 'A B ...' will have (say) one third of his vote transferred
to B, whereas the one who lists his choices as 'W A B ...' will have all of
his vote transferred to B, since A will already have been declared elected
by the time W is eliminated. Since one aim of an electoral system should be
to discourage tactical voting, this seems to me to be a serious drawback.

<p>
If, on the other hand, one agrees that surpluses will be transferred to
candidates who have already reached the quota, then one has to do something
to avoid the never-ending transfer of progressively smaller surpluses
between two candidates. Whatever strategy one adopts, it is bound to
introduce other anomalies, albeit smaller than the one already described.

<p>
If the counting is carried out by computer, however, no such arbitrary
decisions are necessary, as the never-ending transfer can be carried out to
completion, or at least until the surpluses remaining to be transferred are
less than (say) a millionth of a vote. The resulting procedure is described
in the next paragraph in a different way. It is comparatively simple in
concept, and the undoubtedly long calculations are all safely hidden inside
the computer.

<p>
The counting is divided into rounds, in each of which one candidate is
eliminated. In each round of the elimination, a scaling factor is assigned
to each candidate, representing the proportion that will actually be
credited to him out of the votes potentially available to him, in such a way
that: 

<ol>
<li> a candidate who has already been eliminated in a previous round is
assigned scaling factor 0, so that no votes will be credited to him in the
current round;

<li> a candidate whose fate is undecided at the end of the current round is
assigned scaling factor 1, so that all the votes potentially available to
him are credited to him; and

<li> a candidate who by the end of the current round has at least the quota
of votes necessary for election (and so is certain to be elected) is
assigned a scaling factor less than or equal to 1 so that the number of
votes credited to him is brought down exactly to the quota.

</ol>

 The candidate with the smallest number of votes is then eliminated, and the
process is repeated until the number of candidates remaining is equal to the
number of places to be filled.

<p>
For example, suppose that, in a given round of the counting, candidates A
and B are certain of election and have scaling factors of two thirds and
three quarters respectively, and candidates C, D and E have already been
eliminated in previous rounds, whereas the fates of the remaining candidates
remain undecided. Then a voter who lists the candidates in the order C, A,
D, B, E, F will, in the current round, have none of his vote assigned to C.
The whole of his vote will be passed down to A, who will retain two thirds
of it. The remaining third of his vote will be passed over D and down to B,
who will retain three quarters of it (that is, one quarter of a vote). The
twelfth of a vote that is still unassigned will be passed over E and down to
F, who will retain all of it.

<p>
The calculation of the scaling factors, which would be prohibitively long to
do by hand, could be carried out quite easily by computer. However, once the
computer had done the work, it would be possible to check by hand that the
computer was correct; certainly this would take no longer than carrying out
the whole count by hand as at present.

<p>
(This situation is not unusual in mathematics. Suppose, for example, that
you were asked to find a number <i>x</i> between 1 and 2, accurate to seven
places of decimals, such that (say) x(x(x(x(x+1)-4)-3)+3)+1 = 0.

<p>
You would find it very tedious to do so by hand, even with the aid of a
pocket calculator.  Suppose, however, that a computer were to do the work
and tell you that the answer is 1.6825071; then it would take you only a few
minutes to check that the computer was correct.) 

<p>
The size of computer required would depend on the size of the electorate, on
the number of places to be filled and, to a lesser extent, on the number of
candidates. In the case of an election with both a very large electorate and
a large number of places, it might even be impossible to carry out the
calculations in a reasonable time with the present generation of computers. 

<p>
However, for parliamentary elections, there would be no problem: the
calculations could be done quite easily even on a mini-computer.

<p>
Since proposing the above method, I have learnt that it is not new; a
differently worded but exactly equivalent method was proposed by Brian Meek
in 1969.<a href="#r1">[1]</a>,<a href="#r2">[2]</a>  I hope it will be possible
to agree that, whenever computer counting is used in STV elections, this
method should be used.
