<H2> The "official" and "unofficial" definitions of "Condorcet"
(and about range voting and red herrings) </H2>
<small>[Adapted from a electorama web post by Warren D. Smith in August 2005.]</small>

<p>
Most political science books define "Condorcet critierion" in a way that implicitly 
or explicitly assumes the voting method uses ranked ballots.
That is because Condorcet himself had them, and only them, in mind.
Our point is that there are <i>two</i> natural ways to
generalize the definition of the "Condorcet criteron" to more general voting methods.
</p>

<p>
To try to say so hits
a wall of opposition from traditionalists,
which is a red herring (i.e. distraction from the main issue
of which is better &ndash; range voting or Condorcet methods?).
To avoid being distracted by that red herring,
let us simply make the "classic"
Condorcet definition be:  
</p>

<p>
<b>CLASSIC CONDORCET(CC for short):</b>
Elects a winner W, whom the voters based on the <i>counts</i> of X>W and W>X type votes,
agree is pairwise-superior to all others X (if such a "Condorcet winner" exists &ndash; in
the sad case where none exists, then no claim is made).   
Only applicable to: voting systems in which candidate rank orderings
are deducible from the votes.
</p>

<p>
Then the "<i>unofficial</i> Warren D. Smith Condorcet property" of a voting system
(which is related and also interesting) is
</p>

<p>
<b>WDS-CONDORCET (WC for short):</b>   Elects a winner W, whom the voters would
agree is superior to all others X (if such a "WDS-Condorcet winner" exists &ndash; if none exists,
then no claim is made) in each paired-off 2-candidate election "W versus X",
using the same voting system but with all but these two candidates erased from
all votes.  Only applicable to: voting systems in which "erasing all candidates from all votes,
except for a preselected pair of candidates" has a meaning.
</p>

<blockquote>
<small><b>Another view:</b>
The "classic" CC definition 
assumes that the 2-candidate comparisons are based on plurality voting
(PV). With this definition, there are circumstances under which the
range voting (RV) winner is not the Condorcet Winner (CW). But I think it is more
reasonable to do the 2-person comparisons on the basis of the <i>same</i>
system used for the multi-candidate election being considered.
[That is the WC definition].
<br><br>
If this is done, then RV always
picks the CW (and, in fact, the RV winner is <i>always</i> a CW). Note
that this is <i>not</i> the case for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), 
where even considering 2-candidate
IRV elections, IRV can fail to elect the CW.
 &ndash; Prof. Steven Unger (Columbia University, NY) in
a 2008 web post independently rediscovering this same idea.
<br><br>
[That is, in a 3-candidate IRV election, IRV can fail to elect a candidate who would defeat 
every rival in 2-candidate IRV elections.  
Example: 2 votes B>A>C, 2 votes C>A>B, and 1 vote A>B>C.  B wins this 3-candidate IRV election but
A beats both B and C pairwise by 3:2 majority vote.]

<H3> Comparison of the two definitions CC and WC </H3>

<ol>
<li>
WC seems applicable to a strict <i>superset</i> of the voting systems to which CC is applicable,
so in that sense it is a <i>more useful</i>, important, and valuable property.
</li><li>
WC and CC happen to be <i>equivalent</i> on all "ranked-ballot voting systems which
reduce in the 2-candidate case to majority vote."  I.e. every system that CC has ever been 
tested on, in all preceding political science literature (apparently).  
(This justifies our claim that <i>both</i> are fully valid ways to generalize the 
original conception.)
But they are <i>not</i> equivalent if
applied to voting systems more general than that, e.g. range voting:
&nbsp; <a href="CondRangeExample.html">Example</a>.
</li><li>
Is CC a desirable property for a voting system to have?  It sounds that way at first, 
but it is a known <a href="AddTopFail.html">theorem</a> 
that any voting system obeying CC must exhibit
"add top" and/or "add bottom" failures (e.g. adding a new vote ranking the current-winner 
top, can cause him to lose).  That makes CC sound less like a desirable property.
And there is also the <a href="FishburnAntiC.html">Fishburn counterexample</a>
and
<a href="CondCoursera.html">Condorcet self-contradiction</a> example.
</li><li>
Also, a simple instance where CC clearly is undesirable, is the "free the slaves" vote
in the early USA, where, say, 60% of the voters would vote to keep slavery,
and 40% (we assume the slaves are allowed to vote) would vote to ban slavery.
However, the right decision is to free the slaves, and a voting system that were
somehow able to weight the votes based on the utility to that person (slaves: freedom
has high utility.  Slaveowners: having a slave has utility, but a lot less) would
produce a superior result utility-sum-wise.  
In this scenario range voting with honest-enough voters would
be capable of freeing the slaves, although no classic-Concorcet system could do so.
</li><li>
Is WC a desirable property for a voting system to have?  Sounds that way, yes.
</li><li>
Both Range voting, and all so-far-constructed "Condorcet voting methods",
obey WC.
</li><li>
Range voting elections (ignoring exact ties) <i>always</i> produce a WC-Condorcet winner.
</li><li>
All other so-far-constructed "Condorcet voting methods" do <i>not</i> always
produce either a WC-Condorcet winner or a CC-Condorcet winner.
</li><li>
So in that sense, which is very highly related to the yardstick used by Condorcet proponents
<i>themselves</i>, range voting is <i>superior</i> to 
every so-far-constructed Condorcet voting method!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="CondRangeExample.html#sc">More details</a> &ndash;
there is really also a <i>third</i> way ("SC")
to generalize the definition of "Condorcet" and Range Voting obeys one out of three
(two out of three with a bit of generous fudging) while "traditional  Condorcet" methods
also obey one out of three.
