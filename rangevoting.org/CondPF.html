<H2> 
"Participation failure" is forced in Condorcet methods with at least 4 candidates
</H2>

<p>
We shall prove the following theorem.  
<br>
<small>
Our proof is an improvement &amp; simplification of
an earlier proof by Markus Schulze which in turn simplified one by Herve Moulin.
</small>
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem:</b>
It is impossible for any (possibly nondeterministic)
single-winner election method (with preference orderings
as votes) with &ge;4 candidates to satisfy both
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Condorcet:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
if there is a Condorcet ("beats all") Winner, he
must be elected uniquely and with certainty,
</dd>
<dt>
<b>(Strong) participation:</b>
</dt>
<dd>
adding votes
with A ranked top
cannot decrease the probability A wins, and adding
votes with B ranked below all voters who win with positive probability,
cannot increase the probability that B wins.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<p>
<small>
Note: further, the extension to our proof will produce
"maximally dramatic" no-show
paradoxes requiring only a single no-show voter.
</small>
</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b>
Suppose such a method existed. Then starting with the
14-voter scenario below
we shall in six further steps
derive a contradiction.

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption><b>Situation 1:</b></caption>
<tr><th> #voters </th><th> their vote </th></tr>
<tr><td> 6 </td><td> A>D>B>C </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 </td><td> D>B>C>A </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> B>C>A>D </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
 <b>Situation 2:</b>
Suppose B was elected with positive probability
in situation 1. When we add 7 B>D>A>C voters, B
must be elected with positive probability
(by participation) while
D must be elected with certainty according to Condorcet.
Contradiction.
</p><p>
 <b>Situation 3:</b>
Suppose C was elected with positive probability
in situation 1. When we add 9  C>B>A>D voters, C
must be elected with positive probability (by participation) while
B must be elected with certainty according to Condorcet.
Contradiction.
</p><p>
 <b>Situation 4:</b>
Suppose D was elected with positive probability
in situation 1. When we add 3 D>A>B>C voters, D
must be elected with positive probability (by participation) while
A must be elected with certainty according to Condorcet.
Contradiction.
</p><p>
 <b>Situation 5:</b>
We conclude from situations 2-4 that A must be elected with
certainty in situation 1.
When we add 7 C>A>B>D voters,
B and D must be elected each with
zero probability (by participation).
</p><p>
 <b>Situation 6:</b>
Suppose A was elected with positive probability
in situation 5. When we add 8 A>C>B>D voters, A
must be elected with positive probability (by
participation) while
C must be elected with certainty according to Condorcet.
Therefore, A couldn't be elected with positive probability in situation 5.
</p><p>
 <b>Situation 7:</b>
Suppose C was elected with positive probability
in situation 5. When we add 6 C>B>A>D voters, C
must be elected with positive probability (by participation) while
B must be elected with certainty according to Condorcet.
Therefore, C couldn't be elected with positive probability in situation 5.
<br>
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Extension:</b>
In the scenarios in our proof with k identical no-show voters, we
can &ndash; by adding those voters one at a time until the first
one that changes the winner &ndash;
produce a "no-show paradox" scenario with only a <i>single</i> no-show voter.
