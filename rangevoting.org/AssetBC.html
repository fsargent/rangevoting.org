<H2> A difficult proportional representation election example </H2>

<p>
Here is a 102-voter 6-candidate election. (The candidates are named A,B,M,X,Y,Z
and the votes are rank-orderings with unranked candidates to be regarded as co-equal last.)
</p>

If this is a <b>1-winner</b> election, then it seems fairly clear that <b>M</b>
should win.  That is because M is a "Condorcet winner," i.e. beats every rival in a head-to-head
contest (M beats A by 53:49, B by 53:49, X by 71:31, Y by 69:33, and Z by 68:34).
<a href="IrvExec.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>, would, however, 
declare Z the winner &ndash; probably a bad decision.
</p><p>
If this is a 
<b>2-winner</b> election, then it seems fairly clear that <b>A &amp; B</b>
should be the winners:   Every voter ranks A or B as their second choice,
and no other candidate-pair can say that.
(STV as used in Ireland and Australia, would, however, not see it that way.
It would make Z win, with Y as the second winner.)
</p><p>
If this is a 
<b>3-winner</b> election, then Bram Cohen has argued that the winners ought
to be <b>X, Y, and Z</b>.
(And that is what STV would do.)
That is because 96% of the voters have either X,Y, or Z as top choice.
No other candidate-triple can say that.  On the other hand, one could also argue
that the winners ought to be <b>A, B, and M</b>.
That is because every voter has one of them as their second or top choice,
and no
other candidate-triple can say <i>that</i>.  Cohen would presumably riposte that
only 4% of the voters would then be switching the winner-set from {X,Y,Z} to {A,B,M}
and it is not right to pay attention to only 4% of the voters in such a situation
because they'd be overruling too many top-choices.
</p><p>
This example is interesting because the "correct" winner-sets are totally disjoint
if there are to be 1, 2, or 3 winners.   <i>No</i> vote-handling method 
(including STV and <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>) which 
chooses the winners one-by-one without knowing how many there are to be in all,
can do a good job.
</p>
<h3> How would "<a href="Asset.html">Asset Voting</a>" handle this? </h3>
<p>
If we were using Simmons's (or <a href="AssetCLD.html">Lewis Carroll's</a>)
<b>simplified</b> version of asset voting in which each vote just names one candidate,
then the assets would be X=31, Y=33, Z=34, M=4, rest=0.  
X and Y, realizing they could not win,
might agree to give their assets to A.  If so, A would win.
If X and Y regarded M as a better compromise than either A or B, then they could
make M win.
All in all, it seems unlikely that M would
be the winner if this were a single-winner election.  
If so, this is an example of <i>failure</i> for simplified-Asset voting.
</p><p>
With full asset voting, it seems more likely that M would win.
For example, if each voter gave 3, 2, and 1 points
to her top, 2nd, and 3rd choices, then M would have the most asset-points.
If the first 98 voters gave 4,3,2,1 points to their top, 2nd, 3rd, 4th choices
while the last two voters each gave 5,3,2 to their top, 2nd, 3rd choices,
then also M would (more clearly) have the most asset-points.
So M would be in the strongest negotiating position.
</p><p>
Now let's instead suppose this were a 2-winner election.
Presumably X,Y,Z would be willing to donate
to A and B but not to anybody else
in which case A &amp; B would indeed win.
However, if even a single one among {X,Y,Z}
wanted to give it all to M, he could
could force M to be a winner.
It seems likely to me that not both of {A,B} would win, with
simplified asset voting.  
But with full asset voting, I think it more likely
A and B could both win.
</p><p>
We also should note that
some of our original claims about who "should" be the winners might change if
<i>strengths</i>
of preferences were taken into account.  Full asset voting
and <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> can do that but
STV and simplified asset voting cannot.
</p><p>
Thus this election illustrates how full asset voting might be superior both to 
its simplified version, and also to other forms of 
<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>.
