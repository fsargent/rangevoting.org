<H3> Definition  </H3>

<p>
The election of a representative from a single-member district falls to the 
candidate receiving the highest vote.
There is no representation for groups supporting other candidates,
except insofar as the person elected [chooses to] give voice to the members of
such groups.
Hence, direct representation is not afforded minority groups.
To give them such representation, various European countries, with Norway taking the lead in
its Constitution of 1814, have provided for systems of <i>proportional representation</i>,
which necessarily operate in <i>plural</i>-member districts.
If, for example, seven persons are to be elected to a... legislative body,
proportional representation... may be accomplished by having three members 
from one party with 42% of the total vote, two from another party with 30%, and 
one each from two other parties sharing equally the remaining number of votes.

<H3>  Range voting is <i>not</i> a PR system  </H3>
<p>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a>, 
which we only recommend for <i>single</i>-winner elections, thus
is <i>not</i> a form of proportional representation according to Albright's definition above.
If there are 1000 Range Voting elections between two parties A and B with 66% and 34% of
the voters, then Range Voting will elect 1000 party-A winners and zero party-B winners
(assuming the voters hew strongly enough to their party lines) &ndash;
which is very disproportional.
</p>

<p>
<font size="-1">
However, there 
is an alternate form of Range Voting which <i>is</i> designed for multiwinner elections and
which <i>is</i> designed to exhibit proportionality.  
It is called <a href="RRV.html">Reweighted Range Voting</a> (RRV)
and is described in paper #78 
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>
and more simply on this 
<a href="RRV.html">web page</a>.
There is also an unconventional PR voting system somewhat related to range voting,
called "<a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>," discussed in 
paper #77 there.

<H3>  Is PR constitutional or obtainable in the USA? </H3>
<p>
An earlier version of this page argued that PR's constitutionality was unclear
in view of a long sequence of random-seeming
<a href="SupremeCt.html">Supreme Court decisions</a>.
However in Sept. 2007 we <a href="CongHistory.html#PRconst">changed</a>
our stance to say that PR is constitutional.
</p>
<a name="mckinney"></a>
<p>
Proportional representation would be essentially unobtainable in US Federal 
and state governments if it required
a US Constitutional (or State Constitutional)
amendment, since that would take 2/3-supermajority votes, which either of
the two major parties would be willing and able to block forever.
(And it <a href="SupremeCt.html#outlawPR">definitely</a>
is forbidden for US congress elections by current Federal <i>laws</i>.)
</p>
<blockquote><small>
<b>Historical note on US laws concerning districting vis-a-vis PR:</b>
In 1996, congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (who later ran as the Green Party
candidate for US President) wrote, but failed to pass, bill 
<a href="assets/documents/h2545ih.txt.pdf">HR 2545</a>, which  would have overridden previous US law
that had outlawed multi-member districts, i.e. had made PR illegal.
She re-introduced a similar bill, <a href="HR1189.html">HR 1189</a>, in 2001.  
It failed again.
Then she tried again with <a href="HR2690.html">HR 2690</a> in 2005.
It failed yet again.
According to McKinney's bills, it is the 1967 law discussed below
which mandates single-winner districts.
Chronological list of laws:
<dl><dt>1842 Apportionment act:</dt><dd>
Representatives "should
be elected by districts composed of contiguous territory equal in number to the number
of Representatives to which each said state shall be entitled, no one district electing more
than one Representative." (5 Stat. 491.) 
</dd>
<dt>1872 Apportionment act:</dt><dd>
Districts should contain "as nearly
as practicable an equal number of inhabitants." (17 Stat. 492.) 
</dd>
<dt>1901 Apportionment act:</dt><dd>
Districts must be made up of "contiguous and compact territory and
containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants." (26 Stat. 736.)
[None of the preceding standards were ever enforced.  This one was largely and often dramatically 
ignored.]
</dd>
<dt>1929 Permanent Apportionment act:</dt><dd>
No districting standards. (46 Stat. 21.) 
</dd>
<dt>1967
"An Act for the relief of Doctor Ricardo Vallejo Samala and to provide for 
congressional redistricting," approved 14 December 1967 as Public Law 90-196:
</dt><dd>
Congress reimposed the
requirement that Representatives must run from single-member districts, and
forbade "at large" (i.e. statewide) representatives.
(81 Stat. 581.) 
Various states at various times in US history had elected congressmen at large
(e.g. CA in 1861) or via multimember districts
(<a href="CongHistory.html#PRconst">examples</a>), which indicates
they, while <i>illegal</I>, are <i>constitutional</i>.
This 1967 law remains in effect as of 2009. 
(A <a href="SupremeCt.html#outlawPR">quote</a> from it.)
It was codified as Title 2, U.S.C.&sect;2c.
It arose in a peculiar way as a Senate 
amendment to a House-passed private immigration
act &ndash; 
H.R. 2275, 90th Congress, "an act for the relief of Dr. Ricardo Vallejo Samala, and
provide for congressional redistricting." No hearings were held or reports issued. 
</dd>
</dl>
</small></blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, PR was tried in several US <i>city</i> governments
(most notably New York City 1936-1947 and Cincinnati
1924-1957) and the two major parties eventually both fought against it and
played an essential role in its abandonment in almost all the US cities that tried it.
(As of 2000, only a single US city &ndash; Cambridge MA &ndash; still uses PR.)
</p>
<p>
However since it <a href="CongHistory.html">is</a> constitutional, it could be enacted by
mere act of congress, requiring a mere 51% vote plus presidential approval.
This is not "essentially unobtainable" but merely "extremely difficult."
I'd still say it won't happen so long as there is 2-party domination because
the two major parties will both block it.  But it at least becomes possible it <i>might</i>
happen if for some unlikely reason one party wanted it.
</p>
<p>
The whole <i>single-winner</i> district-representative
concept nowadays seems built in to the whole structure of the US federal 
and most state governments, and indeed there are laws 
(e.g. <a href="VRAtext.html">voting rights act</a>)
about the allowed ways to draw district
boundaries which take it as a given that there will <i>be</i> a district from which comes
a representative, and where it is 
generally regarded as unconstitutional to disobey that law (an opinion that
has been stated by high courts).  Nevertheless, it is not explicitly stated in
the (Federal) constitution that representatives must come from single-member
districts, and multimember
districts have been used in the past.
</p>
<p>
Range voting, however, is attainable without constitutional amendments.
Note to PR advocates in the USA: 
if you want PR, we very much doubt you are going to get it without first getting
Range Voting as a preparatory step (which in turn will gradually 
diminish 2-party domination).   
If you think <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
is a good stepping stone to PR, then you are wrong because IRV 
<A href="AustralianPol.html#IRVvPR">leads</a> to 2-party domination
and the two parties can and will always block PR.  Range voting offers a 
<a href="PsEl04.html">far better</a> chance of breaking 2-party domination and is 
a stepping stone to <a href="Asset.html">Asset Voting</a>
and <a href="RRV.html">Reweighted Range Voting</a>, 
two apparently-superior forms of PR.
</p>
<p>
Another point: to those who think PR will break "2-party domination" &ndash;
although you are on the right track, note that
PR cannot ever be used for senators, the president, or state governors, nor for
congressmen from 1-rep states like Alaska and Wyoming 
(and PR also would have little effect on 2-party domination in 2-rep states and
indeed might be deleterious to democracy if adopted in such a state).
</p>
<p>
<small>
In principle, you could overturn the whole US setup which specifies, e.g, two senators per 
state elected in staggered terms &ndash; thus allowing PR to extend its reach into the senate.
However, in practice, that will never happen because the senators will block that change forever.
Hence PR can, at best, cover the congressmen from large states, but not the small-state
ones, and not any senators, governors, or presidents.  This would be a limited kind of
PR and plausibly would exacerbate current power imbalances between large and small states.
</small>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, PR might, even if adopted wholesale thoughout the USA, still lead to
pretty heavy 2-party domination (e.g. Senate 100%) unless
the whole government structure is completely redone, which seems unlikely to happen.
</p>

<H3>  PR systems  </H3>

<p>
The most common PR proposals are
<ol>
<li>
Multiwinner voting systems such as
Hare/Droop STV are used to choose the MPs from
multimember districts (or other voting systems such as my own
<a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>
and 
<a href="RRV.html">reweighted range voting</a>
might be better, papers #77 and 78 
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>).
Hare/Droop STV is advocated by the British
<a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/">Electoral Reform Society</a>.
</li><li>
Party-list systems: you don't vote for people, you vote for political parties.
Each party wins an amount of seats proportional to its vote count.
Each party then awards them to
its candidates selected in descending order from a prepublished list.
</li><li>
"Mixed" systems, e.g.
elect 75% of
parliament with some single winner system, but then
the votes for each party (nationwide popular totals) are used to
"top up" the remaining 25% of the parliament seats from party
lists in such a way as to achieve PR. 
This is advocated by the
<a href="http://www.hansard-society.org.uk/">Hansard society</a>
and both the Germans and <a href="http://www.elections.org.nz/">New Zealanders</a> (2002) 
do something like that.  (Update: A 2010 poll suggests the New Zealanders will repeal 
their MMP system in an upcoming referendum. Later update: they did not repeal it.)
Mixed systems can try to get the best of both worlds (single-winner quality and PR
representativeness for minorities) to at least some degree, but at the cost
of forcing political parties down our throats and rendering "independent"
(non-party affiliated) politicians a thing of the past.
Think that doesn't matter, we'll just go with parties?  
Then you may not have thought through the implications.
New Zealand enacted a "party hopping" law saying 
that anybody leaving a party has to be tossed out of parliament 
(and arguably this requirement is <i>forced</i> by the logic of the MMP system).
That causes, essentially,
massive party loyalty to be built into and enforced by 
the <i>law</i> itself &ndash; disagreeable!
</li><li>
In some sense the ultimate PR system is simply not to have any votes and voters
at all; the legislature is simply selected <i>randomly</i>!  For some reason, although
this is commonly
done (modulo "challenges") for <i>juries</i>, I am unaware of anyplace today
that does it for <i>legislatures</i>.  This practice was introduced in
Ancient Athens where a machine was invented for generating the randomness. 
</li>
</ol>

<H3>  PR pluses and minuses  </H3>

<p>
Ignoring the fact that PR is unobtainable in the USA &ndash; is it, abstractly, a 
<i>good idea?</i>
Quite probably.  
It has been criticized, though &ndash; single-winner systems also have
some advantages.
For example, the German "Weimar Republic"
had a party-list PR system.  It suffered massive unemployment and hyperinflation and
then it gave Hitler and his Nazi party the
largest share of the seats in the Reichstag (although still not a majority).  Hitler
then was able to use that power base plus some extra-legal maneuvers to take over
completely.  So PR did not work out well in that particular case.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of commonly-claimed pluses and minuses for PR.  The minuses
mainly are taken from <a href="RVPapers.html">Hain's and Katz's</a> anti-PR books;
the pluses mainly from
<a href="RVPapers.html">Amy's</a> pro-PR book or his
<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/prlib.htm">PR library</a> web site.
</p>

<td>
<p> In Hain's view the most important thing is politicians have to be
held <i>accountable</i> by voters and a lot of PR systems (both party list
and STV) sever or weaken the "vital links between local communities and their elected MPs."
He cites a magazine in the 1980s that published a month before
the election (based on opinion polls) the names of 448 candidates
who were "certain to be elected," with only 129 out of 577 seats
in doubt.  This proved extremely accurate.  The point is, if
somebody high in a party list is a scoundrel, there is no way
for voters to make him pay in a party list system.
Hain in particular regards Israel (where the entire country is just one "district")
as a textbook example of  total dysfunctionality
of party-list PR.
<p></p>
Even in systems (e.g. Holland) where you can vote for parties <i>and</I> for individuals
(thus allowing somebody far down a party's list still to be elected) there is
still a huge benefit to being high on the party list &ndash; this <i>guarantees</I>
election rather than it merely being <i>possible</i>.
That causes everybody to vote in partyline bloc fashion &ndash; the coalition versus
the others &ndash; since if they vote against the deals made by their
party leaders they fear demotion on the list.  When that happens, the whole ideal
PR strives for, is thrown in the garbage!
</p>
<p>
Hain attacks STV as actually not generating very good proportionality, e.g.
cites Ireland 1984 where
Labour got 8% of votes but zero seats thanks to cutoffs and
the small cardinality of each district.
(Party list and combination systems both would have given Labour some seats.)
STV  would have given Labour a seat in a <i>13-member</i> district, but elections
with 13 winners and maybe 50 candidates, seem impossible for voters to keep track of.
On the other hand it has been argued that STV by zeroing out only
<i>sufficiently small</i> parties, can produce 
beneficial "centrism" and "majority consensus" and favor parties that are more "unified"
(although some would deride that as favoring "robotic" parties; and 
any bias against small parties has the bad consequence
that it prevens new parties from being "born" and "surviving infancy"
thus effectively shutting down new ideas).
</p>
<p>
Many PR systems are complicated and cannot run on simple voting machines,
whereas many single-winner systems are simple.
</p>
<p>
Hain says PR is more likely to lead to "coalition" governments.
Then "centre parties benefit" and tend to hold sway, while sometimes small fringe groups
get tremendous power to make or break coalitions.
And the parties can become <i>polarized</i> with the
most-polar party members getting promoted high on their party's lists.
Katz criticizes PR as consequently leading to "gridlock" governments dominated
by "interparty bickering." Professor Harrie de Swart told me he thinks that in many-party 
coalition governments like Holland 2008 another problem is lack of responsibility: 
who is responsible for
doing anything?   They can't be identified and they can't be penalized.
Both Katz and Hain worry that (as a further consequence of
all these factors) party-list PR systems
can lead to <a href="StabilityBoojum.html">instability</a> of the government.
And indeed, party-list PR led to takeovers by both Hitler in Germany and the Fascists
in Italy, and something somewhat similar may be happening in 2000 Israel.
</p>
<p>
PR leads to extremist parties getting seats whereas with single-winner 
they'd not be able to get seats;
this clogs up parliament with wackos who can never cooperate.
(E.g. Israel has never had a majority party.  France abandoned PR after a brief experiment 
of using it to do their 1986 elections.)
</p>
<p>
In contrast, single-winner voting systems can lead to stable 2-party domination.
The <a href="Strangle.html">2-party stranglehold</a> part may not be so good,
but at least it is highly <a href="StabilityBoojum.html">stable</a>.
(Incidentally, it is a myth that single-winner systems <i>always</i> lead to 2-party domination.
In fact, the plurality plus top-2-runoff (2nd round) single-winner
system  is <a href=" TTRvIRVstats.html">well known</a>
&ndash; based on great experience in many countries &ndash;
usually to lead to <i>more</i> than two powerful parties.)
</p>
<p>
With PR maybe minorities can "get some representation" but so what?
They are still in the minority
and still will lose exactly the same battles they would have lost anyhow with 0% representation
(assuming there is bloc voting, which often happens under PR since there is a premium
on party loyalty in party-list systems) so in practice it doesn't make much difference.
Further, as we saw, even with party-list PR, women were only getting 7-26% representation,
so proportional aint necessarily so proportional!  So it's a con game, don't fall for it.
</p>
</td>
<!-- pluses: -->
<td>
<p>
Proportionality, and only proportionality, truly represents the electorate
and what it wants.  With single-winner, minority views and groups can be "zeroed out"
of power; that can be even worse with <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>.
Sometimes even <i>maj</i>ority groups can get zapped:
e.g.
under single-winner systems
in 1983 women were 52% of voters but 3.5% of British MPs (and during 1945-1990
it ranged from 3 to 5% in both Britain, Canada, USA, and New Zealand).
That is highly <a href="Manitoba26.html">disproportional</a>! 
(Similarly, in 1983 there were zero black MPs although 4.5% of
the British population is black, and in 2001 there were zero black US Senators
although about 12% of the US population is black.)
Hain on page 70 gives a table showing party-list PR indeed causes more women
to be elected (7-26%).
Also Amy observes that
"In the 1994 German election, the percentage of women elected in the 
single-member districts was 13% &ndash;
about the same as in the USA &ndash;
while the number elected from the party list PR contests was 39%."
But Hain's table also indicated PR-STV produces only a "marginal"
improvement for women (4-9% for Malta & Ireland).
</p>
<p>
So with true PR, the legislature will vote for what society wants, thus benefiting society.
</p>
<p>
And we'd get some Green, Libertarian, and Conservative congresspeople, and actual changes.
In Germany's national elections of 1994, the Green Party emerged as the
third largest, increasing their legislative seats by six times, from 8 to 49. 
The pacifist Party for Democratic Socialism won 30 seats. 
Women increased their legislative seat count to 176, which is 26%.
That is real change, and it's representation the USA just doesn't have.
</p>
<p>
With PR we often get <a href="Duverger.html">a lot more than two</a> political parties.
</p>
<p>
Single-winner systems often lead to permanent machine domination by one or two parties
that can last for 50 years and totally shut other groups out of power, e.g.
Democrat "Jim Crow" control of the US South 1900-1960 with blacks totally shut out of
power and oppressed.  In the 1996 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, 
the Democrats won 66% of Massachusetts votes, but received 100% of the state's ten seats
while the Republicans got 33% of the votes but were zeroed out, receiving no
representation.  (That same year in Oklahoma, Republicans
won 61% of the vote and won all six seats.
In the British elections of 1951 and February 1974,
parties won more seats with fewer popular votes than its opponents.)
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>
does not fix this problem, e.g. Hain claims 
in 1948 in Alberta Canada an IRV election gave <i>all</i> the seats
to one party despite only 58% support for it,
and in 1967 in Victoria Australia the Liberals won 3 times as many seats
as Labour despite fewer top-rank votes.
[In British Columbia Canada in 2001, the votes were 
57.6% Liberal, 21.6% NDP, and 12.4% Green, but the NDP won only 2 seats and the Greens zero.]
</p>
<p>
Turnout would increase:
Voters in PR countries typically turnout at rates of 70-80%, compared to 50%
or less in the USA.  (But  turnout probably would <i>also</i> increase if the USA were
to use <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, 
which is not PR, but rather a superior single-winner system.)
But Radek Sikorski in his article <i>On the brink of chaos</i>
[National Review 43,22 (Dec 1991) 24-25] pointed out that in Poland
under PR, turnout was 40% (versus previously without PR 60%).  He opened his article with
"If ever the evil of PR needed to be demonstrated, then the Polish elections have
proved the case once and for all."  There were over 100 parties participating
in these elections, resulting in 18 seats for the "Friends of Beer" party, etc.
</p>
<p>
But many single-winner voting systems tend to yield 2-party domination, which
in the USA combined with gerrymandering nd senate "filibuster" rules 
to produce massively a gridlocked and useless congress
around 2010-2014 which broke records for non-productivity.
</p>
<p>
Stephen Hill says 
PR would also serve as a campaign finance reform:
Since it requires a lower percentage of votes for a 
party or independent candidate to win a seat, it also lowers the amount of money 
those candidates need to spend to win a seat.  (But I'm unsure that made sense.)
And it would make the media cover
alternative-party views for a change.
</p>
<p>
Single-winner systems often lead to dishonest "strategic voting," which causes
crazy and undesirable effects;  whereas the proportionality
guarantee in PR systems <i>perhaps</i> causes voters to be more honest.
<small> But: There are some common forms of strategic voting in STV systems called "free riding"
where you intentionally do not vote for popular candidates in order to maximize
your vote weight for the candidates that are less certain. </small>
</p>
<p>
PR systems are largely or entirely immune to gerrymandering.

Many books have been written on the subject with no clear
conclusion being reached.  I have an idea that my <a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>
proposal
(#77  <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>)
may be able to yield a better kind of PR subject to fewer criticisms that it leads
to battling extremist factions and/or gridlock.  However,
at present that is highly speculative.
</p>

<p>
My personal view is I am <i>unsure</i> that PR is an improvement although I'm 
slightly biased toward "yes," but I <i>know</i> that range voting is an improved single-winner
system because we can measure it with <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> and the 
results are very convincing.

<H3>  What does economics say?  </H3>

<p>
<a href="RVPapers.html">Margit Tavits</a>
found a clear statistical relationship: as democracies become "more PR,"
their governments become larger (as measured by their expenditures as a fraction of GDP).
This finding was highly statistically significant &ndash; 99.9% confidence 
(see her plot on page 39).
So if you are one of those who says "big government is bad," stay away from PR!
</p>

<p>
<a href="Lijphart.html">Lijphart</a>
found the more-PR democracies had more economic <i>equality</i>,
i.e. less wealth disparity.
So if you are one of those who says "economic inequality is bad," support PR.
</p>

<p>
What if we try big statistical analyses to see which leads to a better
economic situation &ndash; "consensus" (i.e. PR) or "majoritarian" democracy?
</p>
<p>
The history of attempts to do that has been messy.
</p>
<p>
Arend Lijphart devoted a substantial fraction of his life to just this, writing several
books on the subject.  In 1994 Lijphart
[<small>Democracies &ndash; forms, performance, and constitutional engineering, 
Europ. J. Political Research 25,1 (Jan 1994) 1-17;
Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-Seven Democracies, 1945-1990,
Oxford University Press 1994</small>]
found no significant differences between PR and non-PR democracies in
either peace, inflation, or economic growth,
<i>but</i> found that PR democracies had higher <i>employment</i> &ndash; which sounded good
until you noted from page 10 of his book the employment "advantage" <i>vanished</i> under
a different analytic method.
</p>

<p>
However, this changed.  M.L.Crepaz in 1996
[<small>Consensus vs Majoritarian Democracy,
Comparative Political Studies 29 (1996) 4-26</small>]
and Lijphart again but now with new, bigger and better, statistical studies
[<small>Patterns of Democracy: Government Forms and Performance in Thirty-Six Countries
New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1999;
Reflections &ndash; dimensions of democracy, Europ. J. Political Research 31 (1997) 195-204
</small>]
claimed that PR produced <i>both</i> higher employment <i>and</i> lower inflation
(supposedly slight, but clear, advantages for PR).
Consequently, Lijphart proclaimed:
"The results of the statistical analysis were clear and almost completely
unequivocal... overall consensus (i.e. PR) democracy is superior to majoritarian democracy...
I have no second thoughts about these conclusions."
</p>

<p>
Sounds great &ndash; at last a clear conclusion that PR is better.  Right?
Wrong!

[<small>The implications of institutional design for macroeconomic performance &ndash;
Reassessing the claims of consensus democracy, 
Comparative Political Studies 34,4 (May 2001) 429-452

hit back by pointing out that the economic improvements that Lijphart attributed to
PR, could instead be explained by 
<font color="#ff0000">(1)</font>
greater central bank independence
and 
<font color="#ff0000">(2)</font>
greater corporatism.
<small>
"Corporatism" refers to the idea that corporations and labor unions
(with greater or lesser government supervisory involvement) enter
a negotiated tradeoff assuring labor quiescence and wage-demand moderation
in exchange for  employment guarantees and increased influence for labor
in setting economic and social policy.  Notion discussed in
D.R. Cameron: Social democracy, corporatism, Labor quiescence, and
the representation of economic interests in advanced Capitalist society,

<li> <font color="#ff0000">(1)</font>
reduced inflation (99% confident statistical conclusion) while leaving 
employment and economic growth  unaffected.
</li><li> <font color="#ff0000">(2)</font>
reduced both inflation and unemployment (99% confident statistical conclusion)
</li><li> PR when corrected for the preceding two effects actually <i>increased</i>
both inflation and unemployment (each a 95%-confident conclusion).
</li></ul>
So this is precisely the <i>opposite</i> of Lijphart's conclusion:
Anderson finds that making a democracy more-PR while holding central bank
independence and corporatism fixed instead <i>worsens</i> both
inflation and unemployment!
</p>

<p>
OK, great &ndash; we now have a fairly clear conclusion that PR is <i>worse</i>.  Right?
Again, no.
</p>

<p>
See, the government, by making laws and creating policies, has a high degree of
influence on how independent the central bank is, and how much
corporatism there is.  So you could argue that the PR governments <i>caused</i> those
things, in which case Anderson misled us &ndash; really making the government PR
has a <i>good</i> economic effect.  But since this influence is only partial,
perhaps the bad effects outweigh the good... or maybe not...
</p>

<p>
So in summary, it is all as clear as mud!  After all the sound and fury from
Lijphart, Crepaz, and Anderson, my net conclusion is nobody won and I see no clear
evidence that the PR/not-PR choice has any effect on inflation, unemployment, or
economic growth.
</p>

<p>
The very fact that neither PR nor non-PR (mainly plurality-voting-based)
democracies exhibit obvious superiority
over the other suggests to me that a democracy based on 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> could
be significantly superior to either (since there is good reason to believe RV
will be significantly superior to plurality-based majoritarian democracy).

<H3>  PR versus single-winner &ndash; the fundamental conflict  </H3>

This illustrates the desire-conflict in a nutshell.  The ultimate in
"perfect" representation is to use random selection, but then you get perfectly average people
running the government.  The Hare/Droop-STV-PR scheme sounds like it is designed to 
counter that criticisms by
taking account 
to at least some degree
of individual candidate quality &ndash; <i>but</i> it can actually 
<a href="PRcond.html">refuse</a> to elect landslide beats-all winners because it prefers
instead to elect 5 approximately equally-bad "representatives."
In contrast, with a good 5-way single-winner election method, you get somebody above 80th
percentile in perceived ability (among candidates), running the country (in fact on
average 83rd percentile) &ndash; better.  You want
to get <i>both</i> best possible quality &amp; accountability
<i>and</i> best possible representation, but 
no known voting system delivers both at the same time, so it's "pick your poison."
