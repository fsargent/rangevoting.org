<H2> Documented point by point refutation of Cobb / Green-party pro-IRV video </H2>

<p><small>by Warren D. Smith, Oct. 2016</small></p>

<P>
The following youtube video was posted by David Cobb, former Green Party nominee for US president
and present head of Stein/Baraka US Green party presidential campaign, on 6 October 2016:

How Ranked Choice Voting Prevents 'Spoilers':
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7MQ7da6sg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7MQ7da6sg</a>
</center>
<p>
Unfortunately a large set of the claims Cobb makes in the video are false, including its title itself
is a lie.
</p><p>
Cobb 0:17-0:27:
"I and you have the right to cast a vote for the candidate who most represents our 
principles and values. And if we do not have a voting system that
encourages that, then let's acknowledge that the voting system is the problem."
</P>
RESPONSE:
Great <a href="FBCexecSumm.html">principle</a>!  Unfortunately, it is false to pretend IRV obeys that principle.
(<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score</a> voting, however, does obey it.)
</p><p>
With IRV (instant runoff voting, the system Cobb
is advocating in this video, but which he instead very misleadingly calls
'ranked choice voting') voters <i>cannot</i> vote for their favorite candidate without
sometimes causing the election result, in that voter's own view, to worsen.
</p><p>
Let me repeat and clarify.
</p><p>
FACT 1: With the IRV system, elections exist, and are indeed fairly common, 
where if you, like an ignoramus, like Cobb,
foolishly honestly vote FOR the GREEN, that act CAUSES
the GREEN and your 2nd-favorite candidate BOTH TO LOSE.  If,
on the other hand, you had dishonestly IRV-voted for your 2nd-choice
(and thus "betrayed" that Green) that would have CAUSED that 2nd choice to win,
thus getting a superior election result in your view.
</p><p>
FACT 2: With the IRV system, elections exist, and are indeed fairly common, 
where if you, like an ignoramus, like Cobb,
foolishly honestly vote for the GREEN, that act CAUSES
the GREEN and the 2nd-favorite candidate BOTH TO LOSE.  If,
on the other hand, you had dishonestly IRV-voted for your 2nd-choice
(and at the same time ranked the Green dishonestly dead last) that would have CAUSED that 
Green to win.   I repeat: sometimes you can make the Green win by ranking
him bottom, but ranking him top on your IRV ballot would have caused him to lose.
</p><p>
PROOFS:
For a simple worked-thru example IRV election, see
</p><center>
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">/CompleteIdioticIRV2.html</a>
</center>
<p>
PROOF OF FACT 2:
In that election, regard B as the Green candidate.  Note that B loses.
But if 2 B>C>A voters, who note had ranked B top,
instead dishonestly vote C>A>B, pretending that they hate Greens, then
that would have made the Green B win.
</p><p>
   Those voters evidently did NOT have the "right to cast a vote for the candidate
who most represented" them &ndash; or at least, if they exercised that right, it sure backfired!  
</p><p>
PROOF OF FACT 1:
Notice how in this election the Green B is a "spoiler" because he by the act of running,
prevented C &ndash; the second-favorite and "lesser evil" of the Green voters &ndash; from winning.
If the Green B had dropped out of the race (or if all voters
had refused to rank B above bottom), then C would have won the election.
But because of B running and his supporters ranking
him top, A, the "greater evil" wins.
</p><p>
PROOF THESE PHENOMENA ARE BOTH COMMON:
See 
</p><center>
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">
   /IrvParadoxProbabilities.html</a>
</center><p>
for computer determination of probabilities of different IRV fiascos in
three different probability models.  The "<a href="Glossary.html#spoiler">spoiler</a> effect" like in fact 1 
happens in 22 to 34 percent of 3-candidate IRV elections in which "IRV matters", 
and in 9 to 20 percent of 3-candidate IRV elections generally.
The "<a href="Monotone.html">nonmonotonicity</a> effect" as in fact 2 happens in 7 to 17 percent
of IRV elections generally and 10 to 43 percent of IRV elections
in which "IRV matters."  ("IRV matters" in an election means that the IRV
and plain plurality voting processes produce different winners. The reason
I say "10 to 43" percent and not just one number, is that there are
three probability models, explained there, and you get a different occurrence
rate in each model.)
</p><p>
Cobb 0:38: "It's called 'ranked choice voting' and its as easy as 1-2-3...
It's just that simple."
</p><p>
RESPONSE: Sorry, the system Cobb recommended really is called "instant runoff voting" and it is so complicated that
Cobb just lied about it, presumably because he did not understand it 
(unless it was an intentional lie).  That worked simple IRV election 
I pointed you to before &ndash; please actually READ it:
</p><center>
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">/CompleteIdioticIRV2.html</a>
</center><p>
Now: do you seriously believe all those crazy phenomena are simple and
easy as 1-2-3, totally obvious?
</p><p>
The reason it is NOT called "ranked choice voting" &ndash; except by liars &ndash; is that 
actually there are an infinite number in principle (and well over 100
that have actually been seriously proposed) different possible kinds of
voting systems based on rank-order ballots.  Instant Runoff is only <i>one</i> of those 
many different systems, and not even a very good one.  The lying propaganda organization "FairVote"
came up with the idea of lying to people by pretending IRV was the <i>only</i> 
"ranked choice" system &ndash; by pretending its name was "ranked choice voting" &ndash;
that lie suited their purposes.  Do not join the lie team.
Join the truth team.
</p><p>
Cobb 0:47:
"empowers you the voter to actually fully express your opinion."
</p><p>
Actually, <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> empowers the voter to score each candidate, thus 
expressing not only an ORDERING of who is preferred over who, but also BY HOW MUCH
(strong and weak preferences).  But IRV does not allow the voter to express the latter,
no matter how much the voter wants to.  Also, score voting allows a voter to intentionally
express ignorance about a candidate and leave him unscored &ndash; but IRV does not (if
you try, then you'll effectively by ranking that candiate dead last, which is the opposite
of ranking him "unknown"). So Cobb is just wrong when he uses the word
"fully" since obviously IRV is only allowing a partial kind of
expression of opinion compared to score voting.
</p><p>
Further, with IRV, even the amount of "expression" you have is often a lie,
since RAISING the ranking of the Green candidate in your preference ordering can 
CAUSE HIM TO LOSE as we saw above (fact 2).
</p><p>
To start to learn about score voting, also called range voting, see
</p><center>
<a href=""></a>  =  
<a href="http://www.scorevoting.net">http://www.scorevoting.net</a>
</center><p>
(and the simplified but less-good form <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> of score also has its virtues).
The fact score is the system used by <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a> should perhaps impress you (as a Green).
</p><p>
Cobb claims IRV yields "actual majority winner"...
again, I suggest you read that same simple worked-thru IRV election example
</p><center>
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">/CompleteIdioticIRV2.html</a>
</center><p>
and also this other example specifically devoted to the IRV versus majority issue
</p><center>
<a href="IRVpereira.html">/IRVpereira.html</a>
</center><p>
for counterexample worked-thru IRV elections where it is made clear that these claims
are highly misleading.  (E.g. the "actual majority winner" can be
the same person as the "actual majority loser" to use Cobb's own words.  
How can both be the same?  Ever?  Well, Cobb misled, that is how.)
For a real-world IRV election where IRV "thwarted the majority" (same election also contained 
both nonmonotonicity and an IRV spoiler!) see the mayoral election in Burlington Vermont 2009:
</p><center>
<a href="Burlington.html">/Burlington.html</a>
</center><p>
and note Burlington repealed IRV soon after this election.
</p><p>
Cobb 1:44: with IRV we "eliminate the spoiler effect"
</p><p>
Simply a flat out lie.  Recall the above counterexample IRV election which
involved a spoiler, and the Burlington
real-world counterexample election, and fact 1.  (Even a single counterexample
somewhere in the universe would suffice to show this was false; I have many.)
</p><p>
Cobb 1:47:  with IRV we "avoid mudslinging and character assassination, encourages...
civil tone."
</p><p>
What a lovely world that would be, huh?
Unfortunately this claim is not based on valid evidence.
There actually was a preliminary paper trying to obtain evidence for
claims of this kind, but as I pointed out to its main author Caroline Tolbert in 
email which
she never answered, their statistics were invalid.  (Essentially, their entire study was 
based on just three IRV elections, simply not enough to draw statistically significant conclusions,
but they tried anyway but without using or even mentioning statistical techniques like "Bonferroni correction"
which are known to be needed to prevent deluding yourself.)
</p><p>
This enhanced-civility claim might even be true, but if so it will not be easy to prove it,
and it never has been proven.  It is speculation.  Meanwhile, IRV is biased in favor of "extremists"
and against "centrists" and that really <i>has</i> been proven, and if you want I can
direct you to more references on that, but start with
</p><center>
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">/IrvExtreme.html</a>
</center><p>
and this bias is likely not going to help with "civility" &ndash; if you
act uncivil that maybe makes you more extreme-appearing, which will help you win
under IRV.
</p><p>
Australia is by far the greatest user of IRV, having conducted more IRV elections
than every other country combined (elects its lower house with IRV and has for nearly 100 years).
Perhaps Cobb should have taken <a href="AusIRV.html">note</a>
that the Australian Greens, apparently every other
Australian 3rd party, and the Australian populace as a 
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">whole</a>, all want to get rid of IRV; and that IRV has
<a href="AustralianPol.html">yielded</a> massive 2-party domination in
Australia's IRV-elected house.  Only a single third-party
member ever won election to their House during 1950-2015 
in a normal (not special vacancy-filling) 
IRV election. His name is Adam Bandt.
