<h2> The BOM and OBO skating scoring systems, embarrassing "flip-flops,"
and the heretofore largely unknown greatest available dataset of important
real-world Condorcet elections  </h2>

<p>
The ISU (International Skater's Union) used to use a scoring system called "BOM"
for allocating gold, silver, and bronze medals.  This 
<a href="OlympBonaly.html">resulted</a> in a highly embarrassing
(for them) problem in the 1995 World Figure Skating Championships:
After they had finished all their skating, and all the judges had published
their scores for all their skates,
the USA's Nicole Bobek was in second place and France's Surya Bonaly in third.
But then the 14-year-old phenom Michelle Kwan skated surprisingly well (but not well enough
to get a medal).  As a result of <i>Kwan's</i> skate, <i>Bobek and Bonaly switched places!</i>
</p>
<p>
This crazy voting-system pathology became known as "the great flip-flop."  
Bonaly got silver, Bobek got bronze, and voting-theorist 
<a href="ArrowThm.html">Kenneth Arrow</a>
got a Nobel.
</p>
<p>
After another amazing last-minute medal flip-flop
happened at the 1997 European men's championships, the ISU had had enough.
Its head Ottavio Cinquanta rolled out a new scoring system called "OBO" in 1998, 
promising "if you are in front of me, then you will stay in front of me!"
But that claim was false.  And anybody familiar with 
<a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a> could have 
told him instantly that it had
to be false.
</p>
<p>
But the deeper and more important question is <i>how</i> false?  
E.g. perhaps OBO yields <i>fewer</i> flip-flops
although not zero.
</p>

<h3> Sandra Loosemore </h3>
<p>
A lot of light was cast on that in 1998 
by PhD computer programmer and
skating expert <a href="http://www.frogsonice.com/skateweb/obo/">Sandra J. Loosemore</a>.
(Hackers know Loosemore as the author of the
<i>Gnu C Library Reference Manual</i>, while skaters
know her as the founder of "SkateWeb" and webmaster of the World Skating Federation.)
</p>
<p>
She ran the <a href="assets/documents/SkateData1998.txt">scores</a> from the
1998 World Junior, European and World Championships, plus the 1998 Olympics,
through a computer program she'd written to do OBO scoring, finding <i>numerous</i>
flip-flop examples.
Under OBO they would have occurred in
<ul>
<li>
7 of 14 competition segments at the Juniors, 
</li><li>
3 of 10 at the Europeans,
</li><li>
8 of 14 at the Worlds (involving 12 sets of flips),
and 
</li><li>
4 of 10 at the Olympics!
</li></ul>
In all that was 22 flip-exhibiting competition segments (involving 28 "flips") out of 48 
total segments!
</p><p>
Of course, the ISU then ignored all Loosemore's examples, and
adopted OBO anyway.
</p><p>
Since the embarrassment then continued, 
in 2003 Cinquanta
decided on a new "fix" of the scoring problems &ndash; the numerical scores of
skaters by judges 
were to be <I>secret</I> so that nobody would know how any judge had scored any skater.
That inspired a fan protest at the 2003 Worlds in which Cinquanta was personally 
jeered by the audience.
</p><p>
Then in 2004 the ISU adopted an even-crazier system
in which some judges were <i>randomly</i> chosen to be <i>ignored</i>!
As a result, the final placing could and often did depend on the random number generator.
In the 2006 worlds, according to an analysis by statistics professor
John W. Emerson in
<i>Chance</i>  20,2 (2007), Petrova and Tikhonov got the bronze because of the 3 
randomly-chosen eliminated judges &ndash; 
with the full 12-judge panel, they would have got silver.
In the European Women's Championships Short Program, 
<i>every</i> one of the top 5 skaters' final rankings, 
except
for the Gold medalist Irene Slutskaya, was determined by chance, i.e. would have
changed with different randomness to <i>any</i> desired value.
</p>
<p>
I personally would recommend the simple <a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed mean</a>
voting system for use
in judging skating (diving, gymnastics) events.  It is far simpler than either
BOM and OBO, it uses the judges' numerical scores instead of 
ignoring them, and it truly abolishes
"flip flops."
</p>

<h2> What are BOM and OBO, and how do "flip-flops" happen exactly? </h2>

<p>
How do these "flip flops" occur, exactly?
We now present an example found by Loosemore inside the 
skating-score data from   the men's short program
at the 1998 Olympics.
In the actual competition, these were 11th through 16th 
placing skaters in the field of 29.  To save space we shall only list these
6 skaters and their scores and pairwise tables (rather than the whole 29,
which would need an enormous 29&times;29 table).
</p>
<P>
Here are their marks, listed in their skate (chronological) order:
</p>
<br>

<b>Michael Shmerkin</b>
<BR><table><tr><td>4.7</td><td>5.2</td><td>5.1</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.9</td><td>4.9</td><td>4.9</td><td>4.7</td><td>5.1</td></tr>

<tr><td>5.6</td><td>5.4</td><td>5.7</td><td>5.1</td><td>5.5</td><td>5.6</td><td>5.3</td><td>5.2</td><td>5.4</td></tr></table>

<br><b>Viacheslav Zagorodniuk</b>
<BR><table><tr><td>4.7</td><td>5.0</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.8</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.4</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.5</td><td>5.8</td><td>5.5</td><td>5.5</td><td>5.3</td><td>5.6</td><td>5.3</td><td>5.1</td><td>5.5</td></tr></table>

<P>
The <b>BOM</b> scoring system is as follows.
<ol>
<li>
Based on that judge's numerical scores, number the 
skaters 1,2,3... from best to worst.
Note that from then onward the old BOM (as well as the new OBO)
system both <i>ignore</I> the actual numerical scores (such as "5.9") got by
each skater, and only consider their <i>ordinal rankings</i> &ndash; e.g. if a judge
scores Shmerkin 5.9 and Weiss 2.1, that counts the same as a judge who scores Shmerkin 2.5
and Weiss 2.4.  
</li><li>
Find the best ranking X for which the skater has a majority of judges ranking him X or better.
</li><li>
Each skater's X-values are
used to produce the overall placements of the skaters.
This usually results in a large number of ties.
</li><li>
To break the ties, we use the majority size
for that skater (e.g. a 7-judge majority saying CLINTON is rank 2-or-better,
beats a 6-judge majority saying BUSH is rank 2-or-better).
</li><li>
But that still 
usually results in lots of ties.
So we then use the "total ordinals" of
the judges in that majority.
The total ordinal is the same thing as what voting theorists call the
&quot;<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda score</a>,&quot;
<i>except</i> that only the ranks awarded by judges in that skater's majority
are summed.  (E.g. if a 5-judge majority ranks CLINTON rank 6 or below, 
say their 5 ranks for CLINTON are 3,6,3,2,1, then CLINTON's total ordinal would be
3+6+3+2+1=15.)  Smaller total ordinals are better.
</li><li>
Ties can still happen, and if they do then BOM leaves them unbroken.
</li></ol>

<h3> "Flip-flops" under the old BOM scoring system </h3>

<P>
Here are the BOM rankings computed via the above procedure
after each skate in our example.
Each row in the results table shows the ordinals from the 9 judges, followed by the 
majority size and place as well as (in parentheses) the total-ordinal
tie-breaker when needed.
For example, in the first row, Shmerkin has a 5-judge majority ranking him #1 
(out of two skaters so far).   
After three skates Vidrai, Shmerkin, and Weiss would be tied except that the total-ordinal 
tiebreaker step ranks Vidrai first.
We list the skaters in rank order after each new skate,
e.g. after three skaters Vidrai is in first place, Weiss in second, and Shmerkin is third.
</p>
(Scores ranged from 0 to 6 in theory, but from 4.4 to 5.8 in practice for these skaters.)

<P><i>
Notice how, although Shmerkin was initially ahead of Weiss and later Tamura, 
that reversed as more competitors were marked. 
This is exactly the kind of embarrassing BOM "flip-flop" that the new OBO
scoring system  supposedly was designed to eliminate.
</i>
</p>
<h3> Introduction to the new OBO system </h3>

<P>
Under the new OBO scoring system, the scoring is computed using a square table the 
size of the number of competitors &ndash;
in this case a 6&times;6 table since there are 6 skaters. 
Each competitor is compared <i>pairwise</i> 
(or "one-by-one," hence "OBO") to all the others to fill this table.
</p>
<P>
In each comparison we
note how many "votes" each skater received from the judges,
counting it as a (pairwise) "win" for the skater who got the most votes. 
Then, looking across each skater's row on the scoring sheet, 
we count the <i>total number</i> of "wins" and use it to rank the skaters overall.
Then the total number of "votes" (this is called "JiF" for "judges in favor")
is used as a tie-breaker.
</p>
<p>
<small>
<b>Note for voting theorists:</b> 
using as a skater's score, his total number of pairwise wins,
is called the "Copeland" system in the voting literature; and the "JiF" score is
called "Borda score" in the voting literature.  OBO is thus Copeland with
Borda used as a tiebreaking method.
Plain Copeland is generally regarded as unusable because
it yields too many ties.
</small>
</p>
<P>
OBO does not change in any way the rules the judges 
use to assign marks to a skater's performance; 
it only affects how the marks are combined to produce the overall competition result. 
So, it is possible to use the same  competition data
(same marks, same skate order)
to illustrate what the results would have been under the old BOM
or new OBO (or any other rank-order-based) system.
</p>
Again to save space we only
state the final 6-by-6 table (and all of the
separate worksheets for comparing the marks from each judge for 
each pair of skaters in the table have
been omitted).
The entries in this table show the ratio 
of "wins" to the number of "votes" in each pairwise 
comparison.  
So for example, Smerkin got one "win" over Weiss, based on the fact 5 of the 9
judges
said Shmerkin outperformed Weiss.
</p>
<br>
<table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Shmerkin</b></td><td><b>Weiss</b></td><td><b>Vidrai</b></td><td><b>Tamura</b></td><td><b>Paskevitch</b></td><td><b>Zagorodniuk</b></td><tr>
<tr><td>Shmerkin</td><td>--</td><td>1/5</td><td>0/3</td><td>0/4</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Weiss</td><td>0/4</td><td>--</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/6</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vidrai</td><td>1/6</td><td>0/4</td><td>--</td><td>1/6</td><td>0/4</td><td>1/6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tamura</td><td>1/5</td><td>0/3</td><td>0/3</td><td>--</td><td>1/5</td><td>0/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pashkevitch</td><td>0/4</td><td>0/4</td><td>1/5</td><td>0/4</td><td>--</td><td>1/5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zagorodniuk</td><td>0/4</td><td>0/3</td><td>0/3</td><td>1/5</td><td>0/4</td><td>--</td></tr>
</table>

<P>
This, of course, only represents a small subset of the 
competitors involved in the actual event. 
Scoring the complete 29-skater competition
via OBO would require a 29&times;29 table with 406=29&middot;28/2
total pairings &ndash; each of which 
requires an additional worksheet to compare marks from the 9 judges, for 407
pieces of paper in all.
</p>
<P>
Loosemore (who prefers BOM over OBO) says 
the old BOM system would require only a single 29&times;9 worksheet &ndash;
less cumbersome.   
</p>

<h3> Even more "flip-flops" under the new OBO scoring system! </h3>

<P>
Here are the skate-by-skate updates of the standings under OBO:
</p>
<br><b>After two skaters</b>

<br><table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Wins</b></td><td><b>Votes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1. Shmerkin</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Weiss</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr></table>

<br><b>After three skaters</b>

<br><table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Wins</b></td><td><b>Votes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1. Vidrai</td><td>1</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Weiss</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Shmerkin</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr></table>

<br><b>After four skaters</b>

<br><table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Wins</b></td><td><b>Votes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1. Vidrai</td><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Weiss</td><td>2</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Shmerkin</td><td>1</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Tamura</td><td>1</td><td>11</td></tr></table>

<br><b>After five skaters</a></b>

<br><table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Wins</b></td><td><b>Votes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1. Weiss</td><td>3</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Vidrai</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Shmerkin</td><td>2</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Tamura</td><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Pashkevitch</td><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr></table>

<br><b>After six skaters</a></b>

<br><table><tr><td><b>Skater</b></td><td><b>Wins</b></td><td><b>Votes</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1. Weiss</td><td>4</td><td>26</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Vidrai</td><td>3</td><td>26</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Shmerkin</td><td>3</td><td>22</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Pashkevitch</td><td>2</td><td>22</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Tamura</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. Zagorodniuk</td><td>1</td><td>19</td></tr></table>

<P>
What happened to cause a flip-flop in the standings? Not only was there the same situation as
under the old system &ndash;
with Shmerkin dropping behind Weiss and Vidrai after initially holding the lead
&ndash; but now OBO generates an <em>additional</em> flip-flop
when Zagorodniuk's marks caused Pashkevitch and Tamura to swap places!
</p>
<P>
Looking closely at the table of pairwise comparisons, 
the problem is that the "who-beats-who" relationships between skaters form complicated 
<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycles</a>.
There is no possible way to rank this group of six skaters without going 
against at least one of the "pairwise wins."  
And
going against any "win" will (if the skate order is improvident)
cause the relative placements 
of the two skaters concerned to flip-flop.
</p>
<a name="manycycle"></a>
<P>
Indeed, a little thought shows that OBO flip-flops are <i>only</i> possible in the presence
of a Condorcet cycle: 
because if we had a strict linear order of all skaters, then all the Copeland scores
would be distinct, no "tiebreaking" would be needed, and the order would stay fixed 
as more skaters entered the picture.
From this we conclude that <i>at least 22 Condorcet cycles were present in
the 48 year-1998 skating-events Loosemore examined</i>.
</p>
<P>
Such flip-flops are not unique to the old
BOM and new OBO systems. 
Mathematicians have 
<a href="ArrowThm.html">proven</a>
that <i>any</i> scoring system based on rank-order votes will produce similar "flip-flops."
</p>
<p>
You also can see   <a href="CondPF.html">this other proof</a>
of a different theorem, showing as an immediate consequence that
the OBO system will exhibit "no show paradoxes" in which a judge, by honestly
ordering the skaters,
will cause a worse gold-medalist (in her view) to be chosen 
than if that judge had refused to
score anybody.  Indeed an honest judge's  ranking of X <i>worst</i> can 
be the direct cause of X winning gold, and a honest 
judge's  ranking with X <i>best</i> can
be the direct cause of X failing to win gold.
</p>

<h2> What does this tell voting theorists? </h2>

<p>
Most voting theorists have been unaware that any "Condoret voting system"
had ever been used in an important real-life application.
Recently <a href="Debian2003.html">Debian Linux</a> to elect its leader,
and Wikipedia in some adminstrative votes,
have adopted Schulze-beatpaths Condorcet voting.
But the OBO voting system had <i>already</i> been
used to judge at least 100 top-notch skating events
and it is Condorcet 
(i.e. a <a href="Glossary.html#condmeths">Condorcet winner</a>,
whenever one exists, will always win gold).
</p>
<p>
So we have, in these skating events,
a treasure-trove of real data about Condorcet elections, 
presently in quantity far exceeding
all other
known Condorcet elections.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile BOM is,
to a good approximation, the same thing as <a href="MedianVrange.html">median-<i>rank</i></a>
voting with a Borda-like tiebreaker added, which is also of interest since
median-score-based <i>range</i> voting (which is not the same thing, but is related)
was proposed by 
<a href="BalinskiL.html">Balinski &amp; Laraki</a>, then attacked compared to
ordinary mean-based range voting by 
 <a href="MedianVrange.html">Smith et al</a>,
all in complete ignorance of the fact that median-<i>rank</i> voting
already been in wide use by skaters and then abandoned as a failure.
</p>
<p>
How well did BOM and OBO perform?
In my view, OBO has been an embarrassing failure for the skating world. 
(And BOM also failed, not only in my view, but in the view of the International Skating Union.)
BOM and OBO both are far too complicated and both yielded and continue to yield
huge numbers of
embarrassing "flip-flops," each of which is a public relations disaster.
(As I said, I personally would 
recommend the simple <a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed mean</a>
voting system instead, which is similar to <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
except based on trimmed mean rather than mean.)
</p><p>
But it would be better if more skating <a href="TidemanData.html">data</a>
were acquired and analysed to
estimate the real-world frequencies of "no-show paradoxes," 
"Condorcet cycles,"
and other pathologies.  
That remains to be done.
