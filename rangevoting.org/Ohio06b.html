<p>
All 4 landslides featured Democratic winners, while
all 9 close races featured a Republican winner.
Via such "pack and crack"
gerrymandering one can arrange to absorb many Democratic votes in, while
producing few Democratic winners out.  
That worked: 53.3% of Ohio voters voted Democratic in congressional House races,
60.5% of them voted Democratic in the Governor race, and
56.2% voted Democratic in the Senate race.
But nevertheless, the Republicans won more seats 
(and it is seats that count when reckoning power, not voters)
thanks to winning 11 out of the above 18 House seats, i.e. 61.1% of them.
Note that the Republicans won the (gerrymanderable) House seats, but lost the
governor and senate races, which are not gerrymanderable.
