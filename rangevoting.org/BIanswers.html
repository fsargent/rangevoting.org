<H2> How to do Ballot Initiatives </H2>

The following websites explain how to create ballot initiatives and get on ballots
in <b>California:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections_initiatives.htm">initiatives1</a>;
<a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections_h.htm">initatives2</a>;
<a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/initiative_guide.htm">handbook</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Typically the authority in charge of elections, voting, and ballot measures is the
Secretary of State of the specific state. 
If you go to the website of the secretary of state for your state of interest you can find this same information. 
This is public information that by law has to be disclosed to anyone who asks for it. 
If the site doesn't have it call them and ask them to mail it or email it to you.
</p>
<p>
To outline how it works in California:
<ol>
<li>
Write the text of the proposed law.
May obtain assistance from the Legislative Counsel in drafting the language of the initiative measure. 
Proponent(s) must present the idea for the law to the Legislative Counsel, and 25 or more electors must sign the request for a draft of the proposed law. 
If it is determined that there is a reasonable probability the initiative measure will 
eventually be submitted to the voters, the Legislative Counsel (with or without
your private counsel) will draft the proposed law 
(Government Code Section 10243).
</li><li>
Submit it to Attorney General:
<blockquote>
Office of the Attorney General,
ATTN: Initiative Coordinator,
1300 I Street,
Sacramento, CA 95814<br>
(916) 324-5490 / <a href="http://www.caag.state.ca.us/initiatives">http://www.caag.state.ca.us/initiatives</a>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
SoS prepares calendar of filing deadlines.  (There also is a suggested schedule in the 
<a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/initiative_guide.htm">handbook</a>.)
</li><li>
You have a max of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures.
Initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the next statewide election at which it 
is to be submitted to the voters.  Must be signed by at least 5% of the total votes cast for 
Governor at the last gubernatorial election, all of them registered voters providing name and
residence address.
That would be (for 2006) 373,816 signatures.
For initiative constitutional amendments the threshold is 8% which in 2006 is 598,105 signatures.
</li><li>
Monetary contributions must be disclosed in certain official ways.
</li>
</ol>
A <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/init_history.pdf">history (pdf)</a> 
of CA initiatives reveals:
<ul>
<li>
Between 1912 and 2002, there were 1187 initiatives circulated but only 290 qualified to be on
ballot (24%).  Of these, 99 (34%) got approved by the voters.  Of these 99, about 1/3
were constitutional amendments and the rest were regular laws.
</li></ul>
