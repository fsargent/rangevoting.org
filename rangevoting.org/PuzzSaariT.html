Puzzle 46: Probability of unclear election winners
</H2>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b><br>
In the <a href="RandElect.html">random election model</a>, with 3 candidates and
rank-order votes from V&rarr;&infin; voters, 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
What is the probability that some two weighted positional voting methods
will disagree on the winner? 
</li><li>
And what is the probability that <i>every</i>
weighted positional voting method's winner will agree <i>but</i>
disagree with the Condorcet winner?
</li><li>
Prove the latter problem cannot happen if 
the model of voters instead is that voters and candidates are points on a line
and voters prefer candidates located closer to them.
</li></ol>


<p><b>Answer:</b>
<br>
(a) D.G.Saari &amp; M.M.Tataru:
The probability of dubious election winners,
<i>Economic Theory</i> 13 (1999) 345-363,
claimed the answer was &asymp;69%.  
<br>
But I don't understand their paper and my computer disagrees.
My computer found 
47% disagreement between the plurality and antiplurality winners in 3-candidate
random elections, in which case the answer should instead be 53%.
(Saari and Tataru claimed these two probabilities should be the same.)
Who is right?
<br>
William V. Gehrlein &amp; Dominique Lepelley:
The probability that all weighted scoring rules elect the same winner,
Economic Lett. 66,2 (2000) 191-197 did the same computer simulation I did and found the same
answer, so it appears I was right.
</p><p>
(b) Vincent Merlin, Maria Tataru, Fabrice Valognes:
On the likelihood of Condorcet's profiles,
Social Choice &amp; Welfare 19,1 (2002) 193-206,
said the probability of a situation such as the example below
in which <i>every</i> weighted-positional scoring voting system simultaneously
elects some unique winner different than the CW (and that CW exists) is about 1.808%
in 3-candidate random elections with a large number of voters.

(c) The possible votes are ABC, CBA, BCA, and BAC for three candidates A,B,C
located on a line in that order.
Suppose the numbers of these votes are respectively x,y,z and t.
The proof is then to consider the linear program
<center>
x&ge;0,
y&ge;0,
z&ge;0,
t&ge;0,
x+y+z+t=100
</center>
supplemented with either
<center>
2x+Qt&ge;2y+Qz,
2x+Qt&ge;Qx+Qy+2z+2t,
z+t+y&ge;x,
z+t+x&ge;y
</center>
(specifying that B is the Condorcet winner while A is the winner with a
weighted-positional system
with weights 2, Q, 0; there are an infinite set of Q-containing inequalities,
one for each real Q with 0&le;Q&le;2)
or
<center>
2x+Qt&ge;2y+Qz,
2x+Qt&ge;Qx+Qy+2z+2t,
y+z&ge;x+t,
y&ge;x+z+t
</center>
(same but C is the Condorcet winner)
or
<center>
2t+2z+Qy+Qx&ge;2y+Qz,
2t+2z+Qy+Qx&ge;2x+Qz,
z+t+y&ge;x,
z+t+x&ge;y
</center>
(specifying that C is the Condorcet winner while B is the winner with a
weighted-positional system).
Either way, the linear program has only x=y=z=t=0 as a solution even if
we only employ Q in the set {0,1,2} rather than the full infinite set of Q.
In other words, we have proven that, in "1-dimensional politics," it is impossible for Borda,
plurality, and antiPlurality voting all to agree on a winner, unless it is
a Condorcet winner.
