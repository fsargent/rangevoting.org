<H2> Phragm&eacute;n's proportional representation multiwinner voting method </H2>

<p><small>
Warren D. Smith. Nov 2015.  
</small>

<p>
Once upon a time, in 2004, I invented what seemed to be a nice new
proportional representation multiwinner voting method, which I called
"reweighted range voting" (<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>).
But what I did not know was, the same basic idea had already been invented in 1895 (albeit for
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style, rather than 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">rating</a>-style, ballots, and only in the "d'Hondt" case)
by Thorvald N. Thiele (1838-1910) chief astronomer at
the University of Copenhagen.  His paper was not exactly well known in
the non-Danish speaking voting theory world, but nowadays you can read it online, 
thanks to the joys of 
"google scanned books":
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>
Thiele was a mathematician of some lasting repute; he invented 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ThielesInterpolationFormula.html">Thiele's rational-function interpolation formula</a>
employing continued fractions.
But then a Swedish mathematician,
Lars Edvard Phragm&eacute;n (1863-1937), stepped into the fray.
Phragmen was a professor of mathematics at Stockholm university 1892-1904,
and later became an
insurance company executive, e.g. was president of national life insurance co 
1908-1930.
Phragm&eacute;n is nowadays remembered for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragm%C3%A9n%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_principle">Phragm&eacute;n-Lindel&ouml;f</a>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1937-041-01/S0002-9947-1937-1501888-X/S0002-9947-1937-1501888-X.pdf">principle</a>
in complex analysis.
Phragm&eacute;n was particularly noted (or feared) for his ability to find flaws
in the work of others.
</p><blockquote>
Lars Edvard Phragm&eacute;n: 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/Phragm&eacute;nVoting1899.pdf">Till
fr&aring;gan om en proportionell valmetod</a>
[On the Question of a
Proportional Election Method], Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrift 2,2 (1899) 87-95.
Phragm&eacute;n's method was first described in "Proportionella val" [Proportional
Elections], Svenska sp&ouml;rsma&#770;l 25 (1895) Stockholm.
</blockquote><p>
And, sure enough,  Phragm&eacute;n found some interesting flaws (or anyway, worrying
features) of Thiele's method.  Further criticism of Thiele was by
</p><blockquote>
Nore B. Tenow: 
Felaktigheter i de Thieleska valmetoderna [problems with Thiele's methods],
Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrift [Swedish state scientific journal published by
Fahlbeckska Foundation of Political Science in Lund] (1912) 145-165.
<!-- Nore Brandes Tenow (1890-1972)?? -->
</blockquote><p>
And then Phragm&eacute;n proposed his own voting method, which also could be
proved to enjoy proportional representation, but seemed not to suffer from those flaws.
Both methods, among others, then were reviewed and criticized by the economist
Gustav Cassel (1866-1945) in a book length 1903 Swedish government report
titled <i>Proportionella val</i>.

</p><p>
Phragm&eacute;n describes his method on page 88. Unfortunately, his description is
pretty incomprehensible 
even if you do read Swedish.  
Here is my version of his
description, which I've translated into English then reworded heavily to cause it to 
make sense and employ modern terminology.
</p><ol><li>
<!--
Alla namn som förefinnas på samma röstsedel, betraktas
såsom lika berättigade. Namnens ordningsföljd inom röstsedeln spelar
alltså ingen roll.
--
All candidates on the same ballot are
equal in the sense that altering the order of their names on the ballot
does not matter.
-->
The ballots are 
"<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> style" i.e. each ballot lists the <i>set</i>
of candidates that voter "approves."
</li><li>
Later on, we shall associate a "cost" with each ballot.
(Phragm&eacute;n used the Swedish word "belastning." Other people often
prefer to translate this into the English word "load" rather than my "cost.")
All ballots initially have cost=0.
</li><li>
<!--
Sedan röstsedlarna äro inlämnade, sker valförrättningen
i den ordning, att den första platsen besättes först, därefter i ordning
den andra, den tredje, o. s. v
-->
Seats are elected sequentially.  Now perform steps 4-6 until all seats are filled:
</li><li>
<!--
För att afgöra hvilken kandidat som bör erhålla en
viss plats, belastas på försök, för hvarje särskild kandidat, de röstsedlar som
innehålla hans namn utöfver redan befintlig belastning på ett sådant sätt att
1:0 deras totalbelastning ökas med tillsammans en belastningsenhet,
och att
2:0 alla dessa röstsedlars totalbelastningar blifva sins emellan lika.
Den kandidat, för hvilken hvarje enskild röstsedels totalbelastning blir
minst, förklaras vald på den ifrågavarande platsen, och den motsvarande
belastningen fixeras och bibehålles under fortsättningen af valförrättningen.
-->
As soon as any candidate is elected, the N ballots that approved him
have 1/N added to each of their costs.
(Note: at any moment, the sum of all the ballot costs, equals the number of seats filled so far.
This fact can help with checking one's calculations.)
</li><a name="pecstep"></a><li>
[This step is really peculiar, and perhaps things would be better if it were omitted.]
Immediately after a candidate is elected, we then <i>redistribute</i> the costs among his
approvers, to make their ballots each have equal costs.  
</li><li>
The candidate who wins the next seat is the one
whose N supporters' ballots will have the <i>least average cost</i>.
(So, for example, the <i>first</i> winner is simply the most-approved candidate,
because if he is approved by N voters the average cost per approving-ballot is 1/N,
which is minimal because N is maximal.)
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>Phragm&eacute;n's election example on page 90:</b>
</p><pre>
         approved
#voters  canddts
  1034   ABC
   519   PQR
    90   ABQ
    47   APQ
</pre><p>
<b>A</b> wins the first seat since he is approved by the most voters, 1171;
hence those approving him have the least average cost, 1/1171.
We now give those 1171 ballots each cost=1/1171 and continue:
</p><pre>
         approved  summed
#voters  canddts   cost
  1034   ABC     1034/1171
   519   PQR         0
    90   ABQ      90/1171
    47   APQ      47/1171
</pre>
<b>Q</b> wins the second seat because his 656 supporters have the lowest total cost.
Because:
If Q is elected, his 
<nobr>656=519+90+47</nobr>
supporters would have average cost
<nobr>(1+(90+47)/1171)/656=327/192044&asymp;0.00170273.</nobr>
If instead B were elected, his 
<nobr>1124=1034+90</nobr>
supporters would have slightly greater
average cost
<nobr>(1+1124/1171)/1124=2295/1316204&asymp;0.00174365.</nobr>
Therefore Q wins.  We now add 1/656 to the costs on each of his supporters' ballots:
</p><pre>
         approved  summed
#voters  canddts   cost
  1034   ABC      1034/1171
   519   PQR       519/656
    90   ABQ   90/1171+90/656
    47   APQ   47/1171+47/656
</pre><p>
and then we <i>redistribute</i> those costs so that 
each Q-approving ballot has cost=327/192044:
</p><pre>
         approved  summed
#voters  canddts   cost
  1034   ABC      1034/1171
   519   PQR   519&times;327/192044
    90   ABQ   90&times;327/192044
    47   APQ   47&times;327/192044
</pre><p>
Now <b>B</b> wins the third seat.
That is because his 1124=1034+90 approvers will have least average cost
<nobr>(1+1034/1171+90&times;327/192044)/1124=195525/107928728&asymp;0.00181161.</nobr>
P does not win, because his <nobr>566=519+47</nobr>
approvers would have had greater average cost
<nobr>(1+519&times;327/192044+47&times;327/192044)/566=188563/54348452&asymp;0.00346952.</nobr>
</p><p>
If we had <i>not</i> redistributed according to rule 5, then <b>B</b> still would have 
won the third seat, because his
1124=1034+90 approvers still would have had least average cost
<nobr>(1+1034/1171+90/1171+90/656)/1124=805455/431714912&asymp;0.00186571.</nobr>
P would not have won,
because his <nobr>566=519+47</nobr>
approvers would have had greater average cost
<nobr>(1+519/656+57/1171+47/656)/566=734177/217393808&asymp;0.00337718.</nobr>
</p><p>
<b>Proportionality theorem:</b>
Actually, Phragm&eacute;n did not state one.  But it is the same as the 
<a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> proportionality theorem, and it holds regardless of whether
we use or omit Phragm&eacute;n's peculiar rule 5.
</p><p>
RRV and Phragm&eacute;n behave almost exactly the same if all voters are 
"total racists" i.e. always approve candidates of their own "color"
and never approve those with different color &ndash; in that case both Phragm&eacute;n and RRV
guarantee the color
composition of the parliament will duplicate that of the voters 
(up to small round-to-integer errors, and provided enough
candidates of each color run; obviously there cannot be 3 Red winners if only 2 Reds run).
</p><p>
The <i>differences</i> between Phragm&eacute;n and RRV behaviors only arise 
when the voters are <i>not</i> all "extreme racists."
</p><p>
One difference is as follows.  Suppose
there is some universally-approved candidate A.  He, of course, wins the first seat.
We now proceed to elect further seats.  With Phragm&eacute;n (and this is true whether or
not we include the peculiar rule 5), the entire subsequent
process proceeds in the same manner as if A had not existed.
But with <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>, the further seat-elections B,C,D,... 
can (and often will) be <i>altered</i> (starting with C) as a consequence of A's existence.
</p><p>
So if the voters behave as "total racists" about all 
candidates <i>except</i> for universally-approved candidates, then 
Phragm&eacute;n (with or without rule 5) will yield color-proportionality in all the seats
<i>not</i> occupied by universally-approved candidates.
But <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> usually will fail to deliver that kind of proportionality.
</p><p>
In this kind of example, which method behaves better &ndash; 
Phragm&eacute;n or RRV?  That depends on your view about the universally-approved candidates U.
If you regard U as "uncolored" then 
Phragm&eacute;n will elect a parliament whose color-composition duplicates that of the electorate.
If, on the other hand, we regard U as "multicolored," then RRV
will elect a parliament whose color-composition duplicates that of the electorate, <i>provided</i>
we get to choose the "internal color composition" of U <i>after</i> the election and do it
in just the right way (there will always be a suitable way).
But Phragm&eacute;n also enjoys this latter property.
Therefore 
Phragm&eacute;n seems superior to RRV  for proportional approval-style voting in situations involving
<i>both</i> universally-approved candidates and "racism."  (Actually a more accurate word than
"racism" for describing what is going on here, might be "partisanship.")
</p><p>
Indeed, we can go further.  Suppose there is some "gray" candidate who
is approved by fraction X of all voters, <i>regardless</i> of their color.
(E.g, each voter independently flips a coin with bias X, to decide whether to approve him.)
With Phragm&eacute;n (either with or without the peculiar redistribution rule 5)
if there <i>only</i> are gray candidates (possibly each with different grayness levels X)
and colored candidates, then 
the parliament seats occupied by non-gray candidates automatically will have color composition
that duplicates the electorates'.
</p><p>
And we can go even further.
Suppose a "blue &amp; red" candidate exists, who is approved by fraction X of
blue voters, and by same-fraction X of the red voters, but is not approved by any other color (green etc)
of voter.  Then the relative proportion of seats occupied by pure-blue and pure-red candidates,
will duplicate the blue and red fractions of the electorate, regardless of how many
"blue &amp; red" candidates get elected.
</p><p>
So Phragm&eacute;n really enjoys a quite sophisticated kind of proportionality.
</p>

<h3>
Adding Scoring
</h3>
<p>
Can we now invent a version of 
Phragm&eacute;n 
intended for <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> style numerical-ratings-ballots instead
of <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> style ballots?  
The answer is yes.  We simply <i>replace</i> a ballot which rates the C candidates with scores
</p><center>
S<sub>1</sub>&ge;S<sub>2</sub>&ge;S<sub>3</sub>&ge;...&ge;S<sub>C</sub>
</center><p>
by these C weighted approval ballots 
</p><pre>
(1,1,1,...,1,1) with weight S<sub>C</sub>
(1,1,1,...,1,0) with weight S<sub>C-1</sub>-S<sub>C</sub>
    ...
(1,1,0,...,0,0) with weight S<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>3</sub>
(1,0,0,...,0,0) with weight S<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>
</pre><p>
and then use Phragm&eacute;n's approval-based method.
</p><p>
Note: the candidates were ordered by decreasing scores on the ballot under consideration.
That assures that all the weights come out positive.  
For example the score ballot (9,5,3) would be replaced by
</p><center>
3&times;(1,1,1) + 2&times;(1,1,0) + 4&times;(1,1,1).
</center><p>
This "replacement of score ballots with weighted approval ballots" idea was invented 
by Toby Pereira.
</p>
-->
<p>
However, Phragmen's method is not perfect. It suffers "non-monotonic" phenomena:
</p><p>
Anti-Phragmen election example by Jan Lanke (mentioned in an unpublished book by Svante Janson):
2 seats to fill, 44 votes:
<p><center>
  15 A&amp;B, 12 B&amp;X, 14 C&amp;Y, 3 Z&amp;W.
</center><p>
The first seat goes to A and the second to C.
Suppose now that the three voters who approved  Z&amp;W change to instead vote
A&amp;C. One might think that both A and C have been strengthened, and that
it everything should proceed at least as happily for them after the change.
But now, paradoxically, A&amp;B win.
