improvement over plurality voting, as plurality is over random selection; range voting effectively <span

called "social utility efficiency" by some), is an objective measure of how <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" title='Wikipedia: "utilitarianism"'>utilitarian</a> a voting 
method is. That is, the most utilitarian voting method is the one that does the most good for the most people. 
Utility has been defined by various thinkers as satisfaction, happiness, pleasure, etc. For instance, if you like 
apples twice as much as oranges, we say that you would derive twice as much utility from an apple as from an 
orange.<br/> <br/> So let us imagine a scenario in which three brothers at a farmer's market have been given enough 
money by their mother for one piece of fruit to split. We describe their utilities for each potential choice in the 
following table, using an arbitrary "happiness unit". Note that these numbers have no bounds, because in reality, you 
can always like something a little bit more than something else. You can always be a little more satisfied than you are.<br/>

gives the highest overall utility. Some would argue from a majoritarian standpoint, that "banana" should win, since a 
majority of voters prefer it. That is how I myself thought, quite adamantly, until taking considerable time to debate 
and discuss the matter. But as we see, choosing the orange gives boy 1 and boy 2 just a little less satisfaction, 
whereas it makes a world of difference to boy 3, since he doesn't like bananas at all. It is my belief that 
majoritarianism is outdated, and stems from our traditional experiences choosing between just two options, or using 
plurality voting, where the candidate who gets the most first-place votes wins. It has been done this way for so 
long, that we fail to even consider any alternative.<br/> <br/> Also, if you know much about economics and/or 
statistics, you should be interested in having the highest "expected value" from a decision. If you had to use a 
voting method to choose something with a group of other random people, you would want the most utilitarian voting 
method, because your personal expected satisfaction with the outcome of the election would be maximized. After all, 
you never know when you may not be in the majority. This is true whether you were voting for a piece of fruit, or a 
politician.<br/> <h3>  Testing Utility </h3> <p>  In order to get an idea of how utilitarian various voting systems 
are, there are two fundamental methods we can employ. If we could somehow precisely read minds, to get honest utility 
values, and if we had the money to scientifically study and interview millions of voters over millions of 
real elections, using all different kinds of election methods, we would certainly prefer to do that. But we can't 
read minds, nor can we hold millions of large-scale elections. We can't even use results from real elections, 
because you cannot infer utilities based on votes. For example, in a plurality election for the fruit in the above 
scenario, boy 1 and boy 2 would have voted for banana, and boy 3 would have voted for orange. But we would have no 
way to determine their honest utility values based on that information. Hence the second method.</p><p>  While 
we can't infer utilities from votes, we <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">can</span> infer votes 
from utilities, making certain assumptions about how honest/strategic, or informed/ignorant the voters are. Thus, 
when Princeton Ph.D. Warren D. Smith set out to calculate the utility produced by various voting methods, he used 
five parameters, or "knobs", to specify these things, and then used a computer program he wrote, to perform 
millions of simulated elections for each of 720 different parametrizations, or knob settings. The number of 
candidates were varied from two, to several. Some elections used 100% honest voters, while others used 100% strategic 
voters. The effect of voter ignorance was simulated, such that uninformed voters might behave as though they liked a 
candidate more or less than they really would have, had they researched him further. The goal was to produce 
enough simulations with enough different knob settings, that at least some of them would very closely model reality. 
<a href="WhyNoHumans.html">This page</a> explains in greater detail why we use computer 
simulations to measure utility.

<a name="expressingutility">
<h3>Expressing Utility</h3><p>Say we were to use the values from the scenario above, in 
which three brothers buy a piece of fruit at the market. We would create millions of scenarios like this, using different fruits, and 
different buyers, and of course, different voting methods. But what system should we use to describe the 
results? Warren D. Smith prefers a method called "<a href="BayRegDum.html" title="Bayesian regret for 
dummies">Bayesian regret</a>", which actually measures how much utility was wasted because a voting method chose the 
wrong winner. In our fruit scenario, the regret is simply the utility produced by the chosen fruit, subtracted from 
the utility produced by the ideal fruit, orange. So picking the orange would produce a regret of 0, whereas picking 
the apple would produce a regret of 6. Bayesian regret is the average of this value, over as many hypothetical 
scenarios as we choose to execute. An ideal voting system that always picked the ideal winner would have a Bayesian 
regret of 0, by definition.<br/> <br/> While doctor Smith cites some academic reasons for preferring to express 
utility in the form of Bayesian regret, some find this system problematic. One of the chief criticisms of this method 
is that a lower number is actually <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">better</span>, and this can confuse people who are 
new to the concept. Another problem that some cite is that the utility units have an arbitrary magnitude, making it 
difficult to compare Bayesian regret figures from two different simulations.<br/> <br/> A proposed solution to these 
problems is to use voter satisfaction indexes. VSI is calculated as<br/> <br/> <div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">  <font 
size="5">(U - R) &#247; (O - R)<br/>  </font> </div> <br/> where U is the utility produced by the voting method in 
question, R is the expected utility produced by random selection (in other words, the average utility of all 
candidates), and O is the utility of the optimum, or ideal, candidate.<br/> <br/> In our above scenario, the VSI 
for a system which selected "orange", would be 100%. That is, (9 - 6) &#247; (9 - 6), or 3/3 = 1. Expressing this as 
a percentage simply helps to make it clearer that it is a ratio. The VSI for a system that picked banana would be 0, 
because a utility of 6 is exactly equal to the expected utility produced by selecting a random winner. That means 
that VSI can actually be negative; this would happen if a voting system selected less satisfying leaders than what 
would be produced by simply drawing a name out of a hat. The following table attempts to clearly illustrate the 
method used to derive the voter satisfaction index and the Bayesian regret from utility calculations.

<h3>Conclusions </h3> It turns out that my 
previous mention of drawing names out of a hat is actually quite appropriate for explaining just how great range 
voting is. If you were to draw names out of a hat, the VSI would be 0%, by definition. If you use plurality voting, 
the VSI will be somewhere around 50%, depending on variables like how strategic the voters are. Yet range voting 
produces very close to 100% VSI, nearly doubling the benefit brought about by the original invention of democracy, as 
opposed to random selection, say by accident of birth (monarchy).<br/> <br/> Range voting outperforms the other 
voting methods listed here, by a substantial margin. Since the entire purpose of an election is to give voters the 
greatest satisfaction possible &mdash; just like when you make a personal choice, you try to select the option 
that will bring about the greatest overall benefit to you, however you determine that &mdash; I argue that 
range voting is objectively the best out of all these voting methods.<br/> <h3>  Improve These Simulations </h3> Okay, so maybe you 
don't like our results. You're a skeptic. You don't trust people who advocate a given voting method to make unbiased 
simulations saying that it is "the best". In that case, we encourage peer review. And by review, I mean that you can 
actually extend the code that was used to perform these simulations. If you know the C programming language, you are 
invited to dive in and add your own utility generators and strategy algorithms, by simply adding functions. Get the 
code <a href="IEVS/IEVS.c" title="here">here</a>. We would particularly like for someone to 
translate the code to the <a href="http://digitalmars.com/d/" title="D programming language">D programming 
language</a>.
