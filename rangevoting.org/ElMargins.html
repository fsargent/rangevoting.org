Typical Margins of Victory with different voting systems in real life
</H2>
<p>
Some have feared that margins of victory might typically 
be a lot larger or smaller with different voting
systems.
To investigate that, this page collects victory-margin data of the winner
versus the 2nd place finisher, in various important elections using different voting systems.
</p><p>
There are some surprises.  <a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.htl">Range</a>
voting seems to produce larger victory-margins than
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting (which can be regarded as range voting with
only the <i>endpoints</i> of the score-range permitted as valid scores)?! &ndash;
(happened in 6 our of 7 elections looked at so far)
exactly the opposite of what one might naively expect from their 
<a href="#noise">Noise Levels</a> arising
from random votes.  
</p><p>
[I contend noise levels are of little or no importance for
predicting real life victory margins, and this surprise, assuming it is not just a statistical
illusion/fluke, supports my contention.]

<h3> The Closest US presidential elections </h3>
<pre>
<b>2000</b>
Gore=      50992335
G.W.Bush=  50455156   (wins in electoral college)
Difference=  537179 = 0.53% of the G+B votes = 58*noise
NoiseLevel=   10072

<b>1960</b>  (Election substantially fraudulent.)
Kennedy=   34226731   (wins)
Nixon=     34108157
Difference=  118574 = 0.174 of the K+N votes = 14.3*noise.
NoiseLevel=    8266

<b>1876</b>  (Election substantially fraudulent.)
Tilden    =4285992
Hayes=     4033768   (wins in electoral college)
Difference= 252224 = 3.03% of the T+H votes = 87*noise
NoiseLevel=   2884
</pre>
<p>
In the above  NoiseLevel=&radic;N
where N=total number of votes for both of the top 2 candidates combined.
The "signal" (i.e. vote difference) far exceeded the "noise"
in even the closest election ever, which was 14.3&sigma;.

Reagan=    58.8%

<h3> The Biggest Landslide French Presidential election </h3>
<pre>
<b>2002</b>   (two-man runoff)
Jacques Chirac=   82.21%
Jean-Marie Le Pen=17.79%
Difference=       64.42%
</pre><p>
The margin of victory here got within a factor of 1.55 of 
maximum possible (which would be 100%).
In all 6 US landslides listed, it got within a factor &le;5.5.

<a name="noise"></a>
<h3> Theoretical root-mean-square "noise levels" from random votes </h3>

<p>
For <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>
voting (each vote is 1=approve or 0=disapprove selected by a coin toss)
N votes should lead to 
<nobr>N/2&plusmn;(N/4)<sup>1/2</sup></nobr> approvals, i.e. the "noise level"
for the average approval-level would be (4N)<sup>-1/2</sup>.
</p><p>
For continuum range voting with the real interval [0,1] as score range, but
based on <i>medians</i> not averaging, assuming uniform random
vote-scores, we'd 
<A href="PuzzMedianAvgStdDev.html">expect</a>
noise level (8+4N)<sup>-1/2</sup>, i.e. essentially the same for large N.
</p><p>
For continuum average-based range voting with the real interval [0,1] as score range, 
we'd expect noise level (12N)<sup>-1/2</sup>, i.e. &radic;3 times smaller.
