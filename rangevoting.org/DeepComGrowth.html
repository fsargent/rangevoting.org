<H2> Deeper analysis of "NPV interstate-compact" growth process </H2>

<p>
<b>NPV's original wording (2006, <i>not</i> recommended):</b>
NPV wanted the compact-states to 
award all their electoral votes to the national Popular Vote winner.
This was to take effect only once an electoral-vote-majority worth of
states joined the compact.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Our growth &amp; joining-motivation analysis:</b>
If a state joins the compact, it may be forced to vote against its own interests.
By <i>not</i> joining, a state's popular vote is <i>still</i> taken into
account by the compact states (as part of the National Popular Vote)
and hence still acts to swing the compact.  Hence by not joining,
a state gains all the benefits of joining, without the disadvantage.
</p> 
<p>
Conclusion: if enough states act in  their own interests, then the compact will never
grow large enough to trigger. 
Hence the entire NPV plan is doomed
to have no effect.  Both Hawaii and California in their governor-vetos of
the NPV compact, raised as their primary
point that joining could force that state to vote against its
own interests.  As time goes by this will get even clearer.   So the
whole current wording of the NPV plan is a dead end.  It is doomed.  It cannot succeed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Our suggested revised wording:</b>
The compact-states will 
award all their electoral votes to the  Popular Vote winner <i>of the compact-states
only</i>.  This  takes effect immediately no matter how many or 
how few compact-member-states exist.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Our joining-motivation analysis:</b>
If a state joins the compact, it may be forced to vote against its own interests.
But it also gets a chance to swing the compact's bloc vote, thus magnifying its 
voting power greatly (and whenever that happens it always is in the right direction, i.e.
in favor of its own interests).
By <i>not</i> joining, a state's popular vote is ignored by the compact.
A state not part of the compact is likely to be ignored by presidential
candidates as unimportant.  The huge compact bloc-vote is all-important
and decisive for them.
Getting ignored by presidents is undesirable.  So that is more motivation to join
the compact.
</p><p>
So in summary, joining is a gamble for a state which sometimes can pay off with a big
otherwise-unachievable impact, but other times can actually hurt the state's interests.
Not-joining is a sure thing which will lead to that state being ignored by presidents
for the rest of eternity.
If joining is a winning gamble, then the state is motivated to join.
<i>Is</i> joining a "winning gamble"?
We claim the answer is "yes" if the compact is suffciently "balanced."  
A state which joins a balanced compact has a good chance of swinging
the compact its way,
thus <i>hugely</i> magnifying its power. Even a mere 25% chance for
that huge positive far outweighs the negative that
the state might not be able to swing the compact (which even then is only a "negative" if
the compact happens to vote against that state).
</p> 
<p>
<b>Our growth analysis:</b>
Our new rules automatically naturally cause rebalancing forces. Let us explain.
</p><p>
(I) If the compact states had about a 50-50 split of R and D voters,
that highly  motivates a new state to join the compact
to swing it over their way. 
(E.g. if an R-state
joins, then it swings the whole compact to R-voting.
That's huge power, very desirable for that state.)
</p><p>
(IIa) But <i>then</i>, we have a slightly unbalanced
R-favoring compact. 
That highly motivates a D-state 
to join the compact to flip it the other
way (with good probability) &ndash; again giving it huge power
and very desirable. (Example: If 50-50 chance of causing flip-over versus
a 50-50 chance of not quite, hence having your state's vote thrown in the garbage can,
then it is very worth it to accept that gamble, since it gives your state
huge expected power gain.)
This joining would rebalance the compact.
</p><p>
(IIb) But consider instead an R-state joining an
already-R-favoring unbalanced compact. That move does not
give that state any extra power
because it does not change anything. No election result
would change thanks to it joining.
</p><p>
Summary: the motivational forces tend to encourage rebalancing the compact more
than they favor further-debalancing it; hence it should grow in a balanced fashion.
<p></p>
<b>Worries:</b>
Those rebalancing forces were all very nice, but maybe not nice enough.
There is noise and randomness too.
If via bad luck we <i>do</i> reach a highly unbalanced R-favoring compact, then a D-state
will not want to join it (will not be enough to swing the compact,
hence simply will be electoral suicide for that state) whereas an R-state
will be neither motivated nor unmotivated to join it.  This
status would also be a dead-end, then. 
That's bad, since we want the
compact to keep growing.
</p><p>
To avert that dead-end,
<i>further wording</i> could be put into the compact to artificially
force balance or at least to create <i>extra</i> forces favoring balance.
For example, this wording could say "you are not allowed to join
unless your state's popular vote last election was opposite-direction
to the pre-joining compact's vote."
</p><p>
The initial start-up of our compact might be random, or might not.
(Extra wording could try to get a good start-up.)
Bad start statuses do not necessarily
really matter because at <i>first</i>, every state is highly
motivated to join the compact to swing it its way, since when
the compact is small, the swing probability will be large often
enough that there should always be states motivated to join it.
</p><p>
<b>Contrast:</b>
The original wording of the NPV compact is
a dead-end immediately for sure,
while our improved wording only reaches a dead-end with some probability.
That's better.
</p><p>
<b>Dead is not dead:</b>
But looking deeper, suppose
the compact-done-our-way still does fall into a dead-end unbalanced state.
Fine. In that case, there <i>still</i> is motivation to start up
a second, co-existing, <i>rival</i> compact. It will keep growing until it either gets
big or falls into its own unbalanced dead-end. If the latter, then there will be motivation
to start a third. Note in this "battling rival compacts"
picture, the states in <i>balanced</i> compacts hold all the power since only they
have the power to change an election result.  Presidents will only
pay attention to these "live" compacts.
All this (creation of more live compacts; motivation by compacts to try to stay live) action
is good in my view since it represents
progress.
</p><p>
There could be further wording allowing two rival compacts to merge if they agreed to
do so by majority vote.  This would allow two unbalanced "dead" compacts to,
by merging, both become larger and more powerful still, and also to reclaim live-status.
Also there could be further wording saying if two rival compacts both reach some size-threshhold,
then they <i>must</i> merge.
</p><p>
<b>My speculation:</b>
If the rival compacts scenario did happen without merger, then
there would be a lot of popular disgust at the situation &ndash; which
would force congress to act to either invalidate the compacts
or to forcibly merge them into a super-compact (the latter would
require a constitutional amendment; actually hopefully the public
would be presented with a choice of 2 rival constitutional amendments: one to
get rid of these compacts, the other to eliminate the
electoral college). In the invalidation case,
fine, we've made zero  but not negative progress, and we've
called a lot of attention to voting reform issues, so: net positive.
In the amendment case: better, total success.
