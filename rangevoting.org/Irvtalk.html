</small>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, a large  number of false statements have been made and continue to be made
in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet, about 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</a>.
And unfortunately, the <b>CVD (Center for Voting and Democracy, a pro-IRV group later
calling themselves "FairVote")</b>
often says false things.
</p>
<p>
For example, the CVD, discussing mathematical imperfections in IRV in 
<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/pr/perfectsystem.htm">a page
"last updated on 12/11/2009,"</a>
<i>misleadingly</i> claims:
</p>
<blockquote>
Choice voting has been used in public elections for over 100 years in the US and around the world, and we have not uncovered even a single example where any of the theoretical defects have occurred.
<br>
This includes tens of thousands of elections with tens of millions of voters.  If the theoretical problems with choice voting occurred even as frequently as 0.1% of the time, there would be many such examples, but there are none.
</blockquote>
<p>
Ludicrous.   Actually, when I examined the <a href="Debian2003.html">five 
Debian elections 2001-2005</a>
I immediately found that two of them had such problems.  
In our <a href="FunnyElections.html">list</a> of national presidential elections,
there are several clear presidential-level examples (Peru 2006,  Chile 1970,  France 2007) 
where IRV gave the "wrong winner"
plus several more unclear examples where that may have or would have happened
(France 2002, Slovakia 2004, Cyprus 1988, Mexico 2006, Iran 2005), plus when
we examine the 150 federal IRV elections in <a href="Aus07.html">Australia 2007</a>
we find at least 9 and probably more like 20 pathologies.
This all is far more than "0.1%."
Plus if we were to extend the <a href="FunnyElections.html">list</a>
to also cover, e.g, Senate races, then there would be
many more examples, such as the New York State 1970 
Senate <a href="FunnyElections.html#NYS1970">race</a>.
And you can check the <a href="Burlington.html">2009 Burlington VT mayor election</a>
for a large number of IRV pathologies all in one election &ndash; despite 
the fact fairvote called this election a "great success" for IRV and had pushed for 
Burlington to adopt IRV (after this election, it repealed it).
Or the <a href="Ireland1990.html">Ireland 1990 presidential</a> IRV election, again often cited
by Fairvote as a "great success" example, but actually demonstrating 
some serious pathologies.
(Fairvote apparently always ignores the pathologies in the very elections they highlight as 
"great successes" then says things like these pathologies have never ever occurred. All lies.)
<!-- And you also can see this press story about the Univ. of Vermont
<a href="VermontIrvCost.html#Mich">report on IRV</a>,
which mentioned how IRV had been abandoned in 1974 (one year after enaction)
in Michigan precisely
because such a "paradox" arose?? -->
And the CVD forgot to say
that usually, the votes in IRV elections have been kept <i>secret</i> which has <i>prevented
anybody from noticing</i> a problem.     Continuing on to the next false CVD statement in
this same document:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Single Transferable Vote Resists Strategic Voting," Social Choice and Welfare 8 (1991) 341-354.
<br>
This article shows mathematically that choice voting is virtually impossible to manipulate, 
which explains why no real world example has ever been found.  
The only examples people raise are highly 
unrealistic, artificial ones.
</blockquote>
<p>
A complete lie.  Many simple and realistic counterexamples are provided on CRV pages e.g. 
<a href="TarrIrv.html">this</a> and
<a href="IRVpartic.html">this</a> one.
In fact, the examples of <i>hard</i>-to-manipulate elections
used in <i>the article they cited</i> are
(as its authors would readily admit) what are
"unrealistic and artificial."  
IRV ("choice voting," as the CVD here calls it)
often is <i>easy</i> to manipulate in realistic scenarios, i.e. with
a bounded number (such as 3 to 7) of candidates;
only in their paper's hard examples with </i>half as many candidates as voters</i> is
manipulation proved computationally difficult.  Is that "realistic"?  I don't think so!
(Next time you find a realistic election with 5000 candidates and 10000 voters, let us know.)
Indeed, this entire line of research was refuted by <a href="ConitzerSmanipEasy.pdf">this paper</a> by
Conitzer &amp; Sandholm showing that <i>every</i> "reasonable" rank-order voting system 
is usually easy to manipulate.

<blockquote>
Crispin Allard, "Lack of Monotonicity &ndash; Revisited," Representation 33 (1995) 49.
<br>
As Professor Amy writes in <i>Behind the Ballot Box</i>, 
referring to the Allard paper, "One statistical study founded that if STV elections were to be 
held through the United Kingdom, a nonmonotonic result would occur less than once a century."
</blockquote>

Another complete falsehood:  Allard's work was based on an incorrect calculation.
You can find more details of the incorrect calculation
in 
<blockquote>
Crispin Allard:
"Estimating the Probability of Monotonicity Failure in a UK General Election,"
Voting matters 5 (January 1996).
</blockquote>
But if you redo Allard's calculation <a href="Monotone.html">correctly</a>
<!--, which was done in
my own paper #78 <a href="/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>,-->
then you find out that in Allard's probabilistic model of 3-candidate IRV elections,
a nonmonotonic one happens once every 95 elections, i.e.
for the 659-member UK House of Commons, 7 members would be elected nonmonotonically 
<i>each time</i>!  And that's only counting one kind of nonmonotonicity &ndash; count the
other and we are up to 5.4% of elections in Allard's model.
Furthermore, in different, arguably more realistic probabilistic models than Allard's,
a nonmonotonic election happens much 
<a href="Monotone.html#summary">more often</a>, namely 5-15% of
the time in 3-candidate IRV elections and 100% of the time in N-candidate elections when N is
made large.

<p>
False.
San Francisco, Fairvote's "biggest success," immediately after switching
to IRV experienced an increase in spoiled ballots versus the plurality-voting races held on
the same day (same voting booths, some voters) by a factor of <a href="SPRates.html">seven</a>.

<p>
<b>Here are a selection of IRV errors from newspapers:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<!-- http://www.fairvote.org/irv/commentaries.htm -->
Mickey Marshall:
<i>Runoff voting is better</i>,
The Columbian (WA) 9 December 2004:
"The [plurality voting]
winner will not have a majority of the votes. 
In other words, it is possible that a majority of the voters would prefer the losing candidate.
Instant Runoff Voting is better than our plurality voting system because it ensures majority 
winners."
<br><br>
<i>False!</i>  In this <a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty"> counterexample election</a>
the losing candidate C is preferred by a nearly <i>2-to-1</i> majority
(201 to 102, to be precise) over the IRV winner D!
<br>
</li>
<li>
<i>Runoff vote system makes good sense</i>, 
Southwest Florida News Press, 3 January 2005 (editorial advocating IRV):
"What if we were able to streamline our 
city and town elections, make them less 
expensive, and at the same time, ensure 
that the winner garnered a majority of 
more than 50 percent of the vote?"
<br><br>
<i>False!</i>  Election expense will certainly <i>increase</i> by using IRV rather than
voting systems which can use present-day plurality-type voting machines
not connected together via a computer network.
For example, see this <a href="MinneapolisIRV13.html">news article</a> about
Minneapolis MN's experience.
See this press article about the  
<a href="VermontIrvCost.html">University of Vermont IRV cost study</a>.
It may be that the cost "decrease"
they had in mind was versus plurality with a <i>second</i> runoff election.
It is true that a <i>single</i> IRV  election is cheaper than <i>two</i>
elections (original plus runoff), if all other things are equal &ndash;
which is the point of the word "instant."
However, because most places that require runoff elections only need them rarely,
the expense ratio on average is not anywhere near 2-to-1, and hence the expense of
switching to IRV would usually exceed the savings for a long time (and considering
the need to continually replace machines, perhaps forever). 
[<a href="HonestRunoff.html#OakFin">Oakland finances</a> discussed here.] Also, once
again, this "majority" nonsense is thrust upon us.  IRV only produces a "majority"
winner <i>after</i> all the others have been eliminated &ndash; not exactly an accomplishment!
<br>
<b>About IRV "majority winners":</b>
Some IRV advocates love that IRV always ends by 
pitting one candidate against another and declaring one the "majority winner."
All this means is that the winner has majority support versus <i>one</i> other candidate.
So what?  If I were to just pick two candidates at random, then pick
whichever was majority-preferred, that'd also have that property.  In
the <a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">nasty election example</a>, IRV declared D a "winner"
because of its final victory over B,
while <i>ignoring</i> the fact C had approximately 2:1 <i>super</i>majority 
support not just against one candidate, but against <i>everybody</i> including D.
<br>
<blockquote>
What makes this lie particularly appalling was that the 
<a href="SF-IRVballotScan.png">official</a>
 wording
of the ballot question that enacted IRV in San Francisco was:
<br>&nsbp;&nbsp;
Shall the City use Instant run-off voting to elect City officers <i>with a majority
of votes</i> without separate run-off elections?  (YES / NO).
</blockquote>
In other words, they lied to the voters of San Francisco right on the ballot question itself,
not just in advertising (although the same lie also was told in propaganda brochures
urging enactment).
</li>
<li>
<i>Wilmington Star News</i>:
A better way to settle primaries,
8 September 2004 (editorial):
"Runoff winners can be chosen by a pitiful handful of voters 
&ndash; about 3 percent in the recent Democratic runoff for superintendent of public instruction.
If North Carolina used `instant primaries'; instead, 
winners would have substantial, if not necessarily enthusiastic, 
support. We'd vote for two candidates instead of one, and rank them 
in order of preference. For example: First choice, Meg Scott Phipps; 
second choice, Osama bin Laden.
<br>
If no candidate got more than 40 percent, the second choices would 
be piled on. Thus, `instant runoff.' "
<br>
<br>
<i>False!</i>
This is just a wrong definition of the
IRV system.  The system they are actually describing here is the
"two round Bucklin system" albeit with a 40% cutoff not 50%.
</li>
<li>
<i>Opednews.com</i>:
Competitive Elections: A Challenge for Spitzer,
by Kimberly Wilder and Ian Wilder 31 Jan 2007:
"Institute Instant Runoff Voting (IRV). IRV is the method used to determine the Heisman Trophy, the Baseball MVP, and some municipal elections on California. You do not have play a game of voting for the single candidate you least hate to block the one you most hate. Instead you rank your choices. You can always vote for the candidate you love first. The winner has to get over fifty percent of the vote. If no one gets fifty percent on the first round, then the bottom votegetter drops off as voters' first choice and their second choice moves up. This removes the worry of spoilers and prevents negative campaigning since every candidate wants to be your second or third choice."
<br>
Unfortunately the above paragraph is packed with untruths:
<ol type="A">
<li>
IRV is <i>not</i> used to select the Heisman trophy winner. Proof:<br>
<a href="http://www.heisman.com/history/balloting.html">
http://www.heisman.com/history/balloting.html</a>.
</li><li>
IRV is <i>not</i> used to select the baseball MVP. Proof:<br>
<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_11_63/ai_n6332589">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_11_63/ai_n6332589</a>,<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award</a>.
</li><li>
IRV does <i>not</i> "remove the worry of spoilers."
Spoilers can and do still occur under IRV &ndash; in fact an even worse kind
of spoiler occurs where voting for the spoiler top not only can prevent your
"lesser evil" from winning, it actually can even prevent the
spoiler himself from winning! Proofs:<br>
<a href="IRVpartic.html">/IRVpartic.html</a><br>

<a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">/rangeVirv.html#BramsEx</a><br>
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">/IrvRevFail.html</a>
</li><li>
You <i>cannot</i> "always vote for the candidate you love first" because
that act can actually cause that candidate to lose. (Examples cited above.)
This is worse that the voting system we have now in the sense that at least now, by voting for X, you cannot cause X to lose.
</li><li>
The claim IRV "prevents negative campaigning" cannot be called "false" since it is subjective and vague and undefined &ndash;
but it similarly cannot be called "true." There is, in fact, some evidence to the 
<a href="FraenkelG.html">contrary</a>.
E.g. see this <a href="EdLeeIRVcampaignAd.jpg">actual campaign ad</a> from
the San Francisco 2011 mayoral election using IRV.
Also, it is clear from computer simulation 
evidence (see the IRV <a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">pictures</a>)
that IRV with honest voters
tends to favor "extremists" and prevent "centrists" from winning,
in contrast to <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> which favors centrists.
</li>
</ol>
Summary: The Wilders in their op-ed unfortunately exhibited massive ignorance
about the properties of instant runoff voting, and even worse, spread
those myths to a wider audience. However, they were on the right track in feeling
that our present voting system has some major deficiencies, and
that two of them are "spoilers" and the inability to vote
for your favorite without being strategically stupid. IRV does not
fix either of these two deficiencies. But a simpler and better voting
system called "range voting" fixes them both. I repeat: with range voting,
voting your favorite top never hurts either him or you; and "spoilers" no
longer exist in the sense that voting for a "spoiler" never in any way
affects your vote on the question of who is better, A or B, where A and B are
two other candidates. 
And to make the obligatory sports reference (this time a correct one) 
Range voting has been used in the Olympics to select gold medal gymnasts.
<br>
Range voting also has the advantage versus IRV of reducing (not increasing) the risk of 
<a href="TieRisk.html">ties</a>
and near-ties, and of working on every <a href="VotMach.html">voting machine</a>
in the USA, right now (computerized or not) with no modification and no reprogramming needed.

<p>
The <b>League of Women Voters of Minnesota</b> put out a
<a href="http://www.lwvmn.org/LWVMNAlternativeVotingStudyReport.pdf">study (2.5MB)</a>
on alternative voting systems which unfortunately made IRV look considerably better than it should have.
Their quick summary of IRV is highly misleading:
<blockquote>
Instant Runoff Voting System (Voters rank candidates;
votes for candidate with fewest first-choice votes are
redistributed according to their second choices until
one candidate achieves a majority)
<ol>
<li>
Ensures majority rule
</li>
<li>
Allows voters to express preferences among candidates
</li>
<li>
Eliminates problems of spoiler candidates knocking off major candidates
</li>
<li>
Eliminates need for run-off elections
</li>
<li>
Does not meet mathematical requirement for monotonicity
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
Of these 5 items, numbers 1
(<a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">counterexample</a>)
and 3
(<a href="TarrIrv.html">counterexample election</a> and
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">another</a> and
<a href="rangeVirv.html">another</a> and
<a href="IRVpartic.html">another</a>!) are simply <i>false</i>.
The League also misleadingly characterizes Condorcet methods by saying
"May result in a tie that requires pre-election decision
on how to break tie."  While I suppose that is technically true,  the
same thing is true for <i>every</i> election method: and ties seem far more likely
to happen in IRV than in Condorcet methods since a crucial tie can happen <i>every</i> IRV round.
</p>
<p>
The League report criticizes
Plurality, Approval Voting, Borda, and Condorcet for being
"vulnerable to manipulation." But they don't criticize IRV
for being vulnerable to manipulation. A naive reader would
reach the <i>false</i> conclusion that IRV was immune to manipulation!
(In fact, Approval is probably superior in this respect to IRV,
and in <a href="IRVStratPf.html">at least some ways</a>, Condorcet is also.)
</p>
<p>
The League also
always stress that Approval
Voting, Borda, and Condorcet were good methods only according
to "mathematical" considerations. They always stress that
IRV's violation of monotonicity was only a "mathematical"
problem. They always stress that only mathematicians
consider e.g. the Condorcet criterion and the monotonicity
criterion important.  This is annoying and misleading.
</p>
<p>
The League also quotes Ramsey County Election Manager Joe Mansky as saying that
counting IRV elections is no problem:
"with the right computer software, 
we can count any 
ballot you want."
That's completely <i>false</i> because IRV elections simply cannot be counted in individual precincts.
It doesn't matter what software you have or how much work you are willing to do.  
It simply cannot be done.  IRV elections can only be counted <i>statewide</i> &ndash; as opposed
to range and plurality voting where precincts can count their own totals and send only
them to a statewide center.  This whole point is totally ignored by the League report
and would require a massive change in all or almost all US states' procedures.
</p>
<p>
The League also screws up in their appendix 3 where they discuss the constitutionality of
various voting systems.  They claim IRV is constitutional and Approval, Borda, and
Condorcet are not because IRV passes both these tests:
<ol>
<li>
There is no more than one vote per voter per office.
</li><li>
Second preferences do not hurt first preferences.
</li>
</ol>
It seems to <i>me</i>, however, that all four methods pass their first test, and indeed
IRV is unfair in the sense that much of a voter's vote is often
<a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">ignored</a>, whereas
with, e.g, Approval Voting, that is not the case.  Approval voting
votes are "more equal" in power than IRV votes because, if the election comes down to an A versus B tie,
then you with your  Approval Vote, even after you have chosen
your Approval Votes for all the candidates other than A and B, can then
break that AB tie your way.  With IRV, if there is a crucial A versus B tie, then
it is often the case that even if your ballot <i>states</i> that you prefer (say)
B over A, that that statement by you will be <i>ignored</i> and will <i>not</i>
break the tie.  However other IRV voters who expressed an IRV preference of A over B
<i>will</i> break the tie and be counted.  This seems <i>un</i>equal and "unfair."
The League's second test
seems to me to be rather ridiculous.  
I do not understand where in the Minnesota or US constitutions
this requirement is stated.  I do not believe the 1912 court decision
they cited can be taken seriously for contemporary purposes.  We have books and we have experts
on voting methods now.  The Bucklin system which was used for many years in many US states
to elect governors would be "unconstitutional" according to both the League's alleged tests.

<b>Here are 4 sentences by Steven Hill</b>,
"senior analyst for the Center for Voting and Democracy (CVD)" and
author of the book
<i>Fixing Elections: The Failure of America's Winner Take All Politics:</i>
</p>
<ol>
<lI>
"The instant runoff ensures the election of the candidate preferred by
most voters." 
<br>
<I>False</I>: <a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty"> counterexample election</a>.
</li>
<li>
"It eliminates the problem of spoiler candidates knocking off major
candidates."
</li>
<li>
"It frees communities of voters from splitting their vote among their
own candidates."
<br>
Sorry, the preceding two statements are <i>false</i> or misleading.
The "spoiler" problem in plurality voting is where voting 
for your honestly-favorite third-party candidate is strategically stupid
because it causes both him, and the least-worst major-party candidate, to both
lose.  Therefore you are best off under plurality voting by "betraying" your
favorite and voting for the least-worst major party candidate, thus
perpetuating <a href="Duverger.html">two-party domination</a>.
The exact same phenomenon can happen under IRV as is shown by e.g. this
<a href="TarrIrv.html"> example election</a>, and IRV also leads
to 2-party domination as is described there.
</li>
<li>
"It promotes coalition-building and more positive campaigning."
<br>
This statement perhaps is too vague to justify.  Anyhow Hill and the 
CVD give no historical evidence for it.  And there is some evidence
<a href="FraenkelG.html">against</a> it.
Another incredibly vague
and undefined claim made by the CVD in 
their 
"<a href="http://www.fairvote.org/irv/talking.htm">talking points for IRV (September 2005)</a>" 
web page is
"Creates a clearer mandate for a winning candidate's agenda, better direction for policy-making."
Well, let us just say, subjective garbage claims like that can be made about any 
voting system whatever and there is no way to refute them...   <i>real</i> and <i>valuable</i>
claims are those that cannot be made about every system, which actually
are clearly defined so one can hope to decide if they are true,  and which are demonstrably true.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Indeed, the CVD is a <b>font of falsities</b> about IRV:
<ol>
<li>
<a name="RBMscience"></a>
In the article by CVD founder Rob Richie, with Terrill Bouricius &amp; Philip J. Macklin
in <i>Science Magazine</i> 294,5541 (May 2001) 303-306:
"Used for decades in Australia and Ireland and considered in 13
state legislatures this year, IRV lets voters rank candidates in
preference order.  A voter's best strategy is to sincerely rank the
candidates."
<br><br>
<i>False!</i>
<a href="TarrIrv.html">Counterexample election</a> and
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">another</a> and
<a href="rangeVirv.html">another</a>!
This is one of the most basic and well known facts about IRV,
and Richie et al are simply telling a flat-out lie.
Not only in IRV, but in fact in <i>every</i> ranked-ballot voting system
<small>
in which unanimously top-ranked candidates win and in which
there is not always a "dictator" voter who can singlehandedly decide everything
</small>,
in at least some elections, it is <i>not</i>
a voter's best strategy to sincerely rank the
candidates.  This is called the <a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a> and
is one of the most famous and well known (if not <i>the</i> most
famous and well known) theorems in all of voting theory.
(So the CVD's ignorance of this theorem is rather instructive about their level
of expertise.)
To learn more about such "impossibility theorems," see 
#79 and #97 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>.
</li>
<!-- <li>
From later on in the same Richie-Bouricius-Macklin article:
"The American Political Science Association even uses IRV to elect its president."
<br><br>
<i>False!</i>  Simply another flat-out lie!
</li>
-->
<li>
Incidentally, this same <i>Science</i> piece also intentionally misleads in other ways.
For example in its note #1
it lauds the Ireland 1990 presidential election as an example of
a successful IRV election, simply ignoring
its <a href="Ireland1990.html">pathologies</a>.
In its note #2 it explains how <a href="https://rangevoting.org/Approval.htnl">approval</a>
voting strategic calculations could
seem complicated and could depend on how the other voters vote, neglecting to
mention that in IRV, strategic computations are <i>more</i> complicated and also depend
on how the other voters vote.  
In its note #3 they talk about how approval voting could
allow somebody with "strong
majority support" to lose, omitting to note that a similar phenomenon
<a href-="IRVpereira.html">occurs</a>
with IRV.
</li>
<li>
From the CVD web site: 
"No voting system is perfect, but IRV is generally considered the best method 
for measuring both the breadth and intensity of the voter's support for a candidate."
<br>
<br>
Well, since "measuring the breadth and intensity" is undefined meaningless hogwash,
we can't actually brand this as false.  However, among academic experts
IRV is "generally considered" to be a comparatively silly system with many flaws.  
<a href="ConsensusSumm.html">More</a> about
the state of expert consensus (or lack thereof) as of 2005.

<li>
And here is another bogus CVD

"[IRV] Minimizes `wasted' votes, votes that don't help elect a winner. 
To the fullest extent possible, your vote will contribute to electing a candidate that you like."
<br><br>
This is <i>false</i>.  In fact, large parts of your vote can be completely ignored by the IRV system.
(In contrast: with many other systems, such as <i>range voting</i>,  all of your vote is
used with none ignored.)
If you prefer A over B, and say so in your IRV vote, then IRV can elect B and not elect A,
<i>and</i> never even <i>look</i> at the fact that your vote said that you thought
A was better than B.  
This <a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty"> counterexample election</a> involves
plenty of such ignoring (only the "simplified" parts of
the votes in that election are looked at by IRV, resulting in a completely 
crazy IRV "winner" D disliked more &ndash; by approximately a 2:1 margin &ndash; than C).
The whole "spoiler" phenomenon can be considered to be about wasting votes &ndash; i.e. if
you vote for the third-party candidate you are "wasting" a vote which could have
been used to benefit the least-worst major-party candidate &ndash; and as we have
<a href="TarrIrv.html">seen</a> that still happens under IRV, still leading
to 2-party domination.
</li>
<li>
And here, right on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/instantrunoff/">front page</a>
of the CVD's "instant runoff bulletin board" (20 August 2006) is the 
false statement that
<blockquote>
Instant runoff voting eliminates concerns about "wasted votes" and the "lesser evil" dilemma.
</blockquote>
Both those statements are false.  In our <a href="TarrIrv.html">counterexample</a>
(or <a href="IRVpartic.html">this</a>)
we repeat for the umpteenth time, 
if you honestly vote Nader>Gore>Bush, then your vote is "wasted" and causes
both Nader and Gore to lose, whereas a dishonest vote for the lesser evil
Gore would have caused Gore
to win (which you prefer).

Dan Cooper correctly remarks: 
Approving of Kerry and Nader will never help create a Bush victory [under "approval voting"],
whereas ranking Nader above Kerry could help Bush win under IRV voting.
Once IRV voters understand that, strategic voting is guaranteed.

</p>
<blockquote>
<b>8.</b> We demand choices in our political system. This can be accomplished by proportional representation voting systems such as
<br>
Choice Voting (candidate-based),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mixed Member Voting (combines with district representation), and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Party List (party based);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
and semi-proportional voting systems such as
Limited Voting, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Cumulative Voting.
<br> 
All are used throughout the free world and by U.S. businesses, and community and non-profit groups to increase democratic representation. We call on local governments to lead the way toward more electoral choice and broader representation.
<br> 
<b>9.</b> We believe in majority rule and reject the present method of election without a majority. Accordingly, we call for the use of Instant Runoff Voting in chief executive races, (mayor, governor, president, etc.) where voters can rank their favorite candidates (1,2,3, etc.) to guarantee that the winner has majority support and that voters are not relegated to choosing between the lesser of two evils.
<br>
<b>10.</b> We believe in multi-party democracy for partisan elections as the best way to guarantee majority rule, since more people will have representation at the table where policy is enacted. We assert that introduction of a multi-party democracy is essential because
<ul>
<li>
The change in the structure of electoral politics will moderate the influence of extremist views and domination by the larger parties, and offer more fair representation to a greater number of citizens; and
</li><li>
A third party can validate and raise other points of view that need to be heard.
</li>
</ul> 
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately this platform is in error in several respects:
<br>
<b>(a)</b>
"Choice Voting" (at least as that word often is
used by <a href="http://www.fairvote.org">fairvote.org</a>) is a simplified form of <a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff (IRV)</a> voting, which is a <i>single-winner</i>,  hence <i>not</i> a proportional representation,
system. See this <a href="PropRep.html">discussion</a>.
(Also, the fact the Greens "believe in majority rule" completely contradicts their call for
"proportional representation," which they would recognize if they understood
these <a href="PropRep.html">ideas</a>.)
<br>
<b>(b)</b>
Instant runoff voting does <i>not</i> cause the winner to have "majority support"
as we keep saying again and again,
and keep referring you to this
<a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">counterexample election</a>.
<br>
<b>(c)</b>
Instant runoff voting does <i>not</i> prevent the "lesser of two evils" effect,
as we also keep saying again and again, referring you to, e.g,
this <a href="TarrIrv.html">counterexample</a>,
or <a href="IncentToExagg.html">this</a> one, or 
<a href="IrvHurtFav.html">this</a> or
<a href="IRVpartic.html">this</a>.
<br>
<b>(d)</b>
Sure, it'd be great to have "multi-party democracy" but the Green Party &ndash;
suicidally stupidly &ndash; here is endorsing a system <a href="TarrIrv.html">known</a> to
<a href="KISSirv.html">lead</a> to self-reinforcing 2-party domination!  
Death wish?
See this <a href="NoIrv.html">list</a>
of reasons US third parties should <i>not</i>  want IRV.
</p>

<p>
<b>From the Libertarian Party platform (amendment enacted 5 July 2002):</b>
</p>
<blockquote>
Electoral systems matter. The predominant use of
"winner-take-all" elections in gerrymandered, single-member districts fosters
political monopolies and creates a substantial government-imposed barrier to
election of non-incumbent political parties and candidates. We propose electoral
systems that are more representative of the electorate at the federal, state,
and local levels, such as proportional voting systems with multi-member
districts for legislative elections and instant runoff voting (IRV) for single
winner elections.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Libertarians here are considerably more accurate in their wording than the Greens,
but the bottom line is they still, suicidally stupidly, 
endorse IRV even though that is <a href="TarrIrv.html">known</a> to
<a href="KISSirv.html">lead</a> to self-reinforcing 2-party domination.
Again, see this <a href="NoIrv.html">list</a>
of reasons US third parties should <i>not</i>  want IRV,
stop having a death wish, and start endorsing a system that will actually lead to
third parties being able to stably exist.  Try <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.

<H3> Is there any truth hidden in the above false statements? </H3>

<p>
There's a little in some of them.
Similarly to what the LoWV says,
it is true that IRV is usually thought to be comparatively immune to manipulation
in practice.  But Approval voting was <i>designed</i> with that goal in mind,
a fact the LoWV report fails to mention.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Vancouver Columbian</i>
in its 22 March 2003 editorial "In Our View: A Better Ballot?"
said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"WA State Rep. Jim Moeller, a Vancouver Democrat and sponsor of HB 1390 [bill calling for IRV
elections], also hopes the method will make campaigns more civil. 
`You don't want to sling mud and call people names if you have a chance of 
being the second choice,' Moeller told The Columbian's Don Jenkins last week."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This may make logical sense.  We are not sure.  If one candidate is leading, it certainly
seems in the interests of the remaining ones to attack him or her.
There may be a case that IRV (or other voting methods &ndash; just which are unclear)
reduces "negative campaigning" (whatever that is), but we are unaware of any
clear and irrefutable argument for it (or even a clear <i>definition</i> of it).
It seems largely an unsubstantiated hope rather than a reality &ndash;
but it <i>might</i> have some truth.  One thing we can say for sure is that
IRV <a href="IrvExtreme.html">favors extremists</a>, which seems on its face to contradict
the notion compromise and centrism is a desirable strategy for candidates in IRV races.
</p>
<p>
Also, IRV <i>is</i> "immune to vote splitting" in the following (fairly weak)
sense.  Suppose the electorate (and the candidates) consists of
various disjoint "camps," where every voter in camp  <i>j</i>
ranks all type-<i>j</i> candidates ahead of all non-<i>j</i> candidates.
Then, 
</p>
<p>
<b>Theorem:</b>
<i>regardless</i> of how the camps "split their votes" among their-type
candidates,
<i>if</i> there exists a camp containing over 50%  of the voters, then
<i>some</i> candidate from that camp is guaranteed to win the IRV election.
</p>
<p>
Proof sketch: at some point a top-camp candidate will have >50% of
the top-rank votes (after transfers) and hence can never be eliminated.
Q.E.D.
</p>
<p>
<i>But</i> if no camp contains >50% of the voters, then
it is not the case that a candidate from the most numerous camp must
win an IRV election.
(E.g, camp A could have 35% and camps B and C 32 and 33% of the voters,
but a type-C candidate could still win if many of the B-voters transfer
their allegiance to
him after all B-candidates and appropriate other candidates are
eliminated, and
whether this happens <i>does</i> depend on how the B-voters [and A- and C-
voters] split their votes among the As and Cs.)
</p>
<p>
The property of the theorem is not a terribly strong property and it is
<i>not</i> unique to IRV.
(Still, it is a good IRV benefit.  Most ``weighted positional'' systems
like Borda disobey
this property, so in this sense IRV is superior to them.)
For example, <b>the property of the theorem is
also obeyed</b> by every voting system obeying the "winner in
Smith set" property,
such as Schulze beatpath voting, Heitzig River voting, Tideman ranked
pairs, many Condorcet methods, Copeland,
Nanson, and Woodall-DAC.  So IRV in no way specially enjoys some kind of 
anti-splitting property.
</p>
<p>
For another example, <i>approval voting</i> (AV) also obeys this property provided
camp members
approve all candidates from their camp and disapprove of all others, and
indeed AV then obeys
the much <i>stronger</i> property that a candidate from the most-numerous camp
then must win.
