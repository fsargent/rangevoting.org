<b>In hindsight</b>: Macron's approval fell swiftly during the first few months of 
his term (e.g. reaching 40% in both late August 2017 and late March 2018).
This perhaps indicates that France wishes in hindsight that
it had elected Melenchon?
In any case it is clear that M.Le Pen's second place finish far overstated her
true popularity and was an artifact of "vote splitting" among her rivals.

But in addition to the official vote, pseudo-election exit poll experiments using
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> and 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting were 
done by a 
<a href="https://www.gate.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article580&lang=fr">team</a>
of academics with government funding and cooperation.
And many professional pollsters (often funded by the media) carried out pre-election polls
using various methods.
</p>
<img src="https://rangevoting.org/ParisMathcApprvApril2017.png"> alt="Paris Match poll">
<p>
We begin with the 
<b><a href="http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Politique/Sondage-popularite-le-grand-bond-de-Melenchon-1231187">Paris Match</a></b>
pre-election poll
"among a sample of 1005 people
representative of the French population aged&ge;18. 
The representativeness of the 
sample was ensured by the quota method (sex, age, occupation of head of household, 
level of education) after stratification by region and category of agglomeration. 
Telephone interviews 7-8 April 2017."
</p><blockquote>
"Question: For each of the following politicians,
tell me if you have an excellent opinion, a good opinion, a bad opinion, a very bad opinion 
or if you do not know enough to say?"
</blockquote><p>
This really is best interpreted as a 
score-voting poll with 4 score levels (plus "don't know enough").
But unfortunately <i>Paris Match</i> only published the percentages of people expressing the
two good opinions (lumped together). 
That is what we have called "approval" in the figure above.
Also note, the <i>Paris Match</i> poll asked opinions of about &asymp;50 politicians,
but our plot above restricts attention <i>only</i> to
the six who contended for the 2017 Presidency.
These six in total got
68+55+48+41+32+27=<b>271</b>% approval.
There also were 5 other presidential candidates not included in the 
<i>Paris Match</i> poll (who, combined, got 4.04% of the official plurality votes).
Some prominent noncandidates included in the <i>Paris Match</i> poll were
(listed with their approval percentages)
</p><blockquote>
Alain Juppe 60, 
Francois Bayrou 49, 
Segolene Royal 45,

<p>
Meanwhile the pollster <b>IPSOS</b> maintains approval ratings versus time
data for many prominent French politicians 
<a href="https://www.ipsos.com/fr-fr/barometre-politique">online</a>;
we have listed many of those in the approval-summary 
<a href="#approvaltable">table</a> below, plus for the further non-candidates
mentioned above IPSOS had
</p><blockquote>
 Juppe 50/40/10,
 Bayrou 38/48/14,
 Royal (unpolled),
 Hollande 23/73/4,
 Sarkozy 29/66/5.
</blockquote><p>
One point of interest is that
IPSOS's high approval rating for Melenchon 
and low disapproval for Macron 
during April and/or May 2017 were <i>atypical</i> 
versus other times (i.e. their approval or disapproval versus time plots have
"spikes" when time&asymp;April).  
Specifically:
</p><ul><li>
Melenchon normally had about 30% approval during 2014-2018
but spiked to 56% in April 2017.
</li><li>
Macron normally had about 43% disapproval during the 2 years prior to his election
and about 52% during the year after, but near election time his disapproval dropped
to 27%.
</li><li>
Hamon, Juppe, Valls, Dupont-Aignan, and Bayrou's approval ratings
also rapidly changed close to election day,
although their changes more-resembled "stairsteps" than "spikes."
</li></ul><p>
This <b>rapid time-variation</b> makes it even more difficult to
decide who "deserved" to win on election day, Melenchon or Macron
&ndash; but it appears that
in an overall time-averaged sense (disregarding the spikes near
election day) France approved Macron more than Melenchon.
And also Macron was more-approved than all his other rival candidates
even without his spike.
<!--, and indeed may have been very unfortunate for France.-->
</p><p>
<b>Endorsements</b> after the first round:
</P><blockquote>
Fillon &amp; Hamon: endorse Macron
<br>
Lassalle, Arthaud: endorse nobody
<br>
Melenchon, Cheminade: anti LePen
<br>
Dupont-Aignan: endorse Le Pen
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Pairwise polls</b> of the form "if the 2-candidate runoff came down to X versus Y,
how would you vote?" were conducted by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_French_presidential_election,_2017">
many</a> pollsters.  The following table
summarizes the results of a large number of polls for
all 6 possible pairings among the top 4 official finishers

<p>
and note the official second-round result (a month later) was
Macron 66.1%, Le Pen 33.9%.
Unfortunately I do not have any pairwise polls involving 
Nicolas Dupont-Aignan
or Benoit Hamon,
but French media 
<a href="https://www.lci.fr/elections/sondage-presidentielle-hamon-repete-qu-il-battrait-le-pen-au-second-tour-mais-sur-quoi-se-base-t-il-2030856.html">claimed</a>
that Hamon's own privately commissioned polls showed that he would easily win the
Hamon:LePen pair.  In the official vote both Hamon and Melenchon suffered from
a "vote split," but of course that problem would not have existed 
in a pairwise "Hamon vs X" or "Melenchon vs X" contest.
<!--
Benoît Hamon would arrive far in front of Marine Le Pen. 
Problem: there will be no trace of a survey published on the issue.

Their exit poll locations and the counts of those polled

are greater because some voters opted not to
participate in the "alternate voting systems" exit poll experiment) were:

</table>
<p>
In all, they claimed that 6358 voters participated in the experiments, although
the first row of the table above sums to only 6304.  
These participant-counts ranged from 36% to 60% of the
total number of voters at those locations (on average 48% of them).
All the non-official 
voting methods at all polling locations agreed with the <i>Paris Match</i> poll
that the winner and second-place
finisher should be <b>{Macron, Melenchon}</b> in some order, 
and that the 3rd-placer should be <b>Hamon</b>.
However, <i>who</i> among
{Macron,Melenchon} should win, <i>depended</i> upon the voting method and polling location.

On average over all 3894 approval-style ballots collected, 2.48 candidates were approved.

<p>
The 82+3 voters who approved either <i>none</i> or <i>all</i> of the 11 candidates effectively did not vote;
this was 85/3894=2.2% <!--2.18%--> of the voters.
</p><p.
Unfortunately, the locations they sampled are more left-leaning than France as a whole &ndash;
since apparently more-left-leaning towns are more likely to permit the alternative voting systems
experiments to proceed on their turf.  One can use statistical methods based on
the official counts in each location to
try to correct for that, 
and the academic team indeed has (they published both raw and corrected results).  
However, this means that
deciding who of {Macron,Melenchon} "deserved" to win may not be feasible.
E.g. their corrected totals with score(-1,0,+1) were very close.
If the score or approval voting system(s) had been used in round#1 and then
a separate 2-man runoff were held, then the academic team agreed
with the pairwise polls that Macron would have defeated Melenchon
in that runoff.

<p>
Here are the approval percentages (corrected to apply, hopefully, to all France)
by the academic team study 
as well as the <i>Paris Match</i> approval
percentages,
IPSOS favorable/unfavorable/don't know April 2017 approval "barometer" ratings,
and official (first round) plurality vote percentages 
for comparison.
(For both the academic study, IPSOS, and the Paris Match poll I
estimate the &plusmn;1&sigma;
error bars should be roughly &plusmn;2%, e.g. for Macron regard 46.1 as "46.1&plusmn;2.")

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>
It is entirely possible that the candidate France most-wanted was J-L. Melenchon.
If so, then the official system unfairly prevented his deserved victory.
Clearly, Le Pen's "second place" official finish was far above the 4th-7th place finish
she truly deserved.  The underlying cause was that Melenchon and Hamon were
hurt by "vote splitting" while Le Pen was a fringe candidate who suffered almost
no vote splitting.  (The official voting method is vulnerable to vote splitting, 
while approval and score voting are not.)
</p><p>
However, since the decision between Macron and Melenchon is unclear, 
it also is entirely possible that the official winner E.Macron
really did "deserve" it.
</p><p>
Macron was a comparatively inexperienced newcomer to the French political scene.
After the election, his approval rating sank rapidly during
his first few months in office, reaching 40% in both late August 2017 and late March 2018.
But Melenchon's approval also fell, to about 30%. And Macron's approval
even at the reduced levels during his
post-election year, still exceeded all his election-rivals.  
So at least as of the date of this writing (April 2018) it appears France 
still thinks it made the best choice among the available options.
<!--
If those are not mere temporary fluctuations, then it would appear that in <i>hindsight</i>
France believes electing Macron was a mistake and more-wanted Melenchon.
