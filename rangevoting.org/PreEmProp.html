<h2> Only criteria range voting obeys, can be
good criteria for single-winner voting systems to obey </h2>

<p><small>Warren D. Smith, March 2018.</small></p>
<p>
<b>Abstract.</b>
The imprecise claim in the title is made precise, and proved as a theorem.
Although this theorem has some limitations it nevertheless seems adequate 
to upend a large amount of voting-system literature.
<p>
<blockquote>
It is not down in any map; true places never are.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Herman Melville (1819-1891), <i>Moby Dick</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>
The title's provocative claim sounds on the surface like some propagandistic
nonsense "FairVote" would come up with about 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>.
Indeed, infamously, "FairVote" once declared
<p><blockquote>
The only voting methods that should be weighed seriously for governmental elections 
are methods that do not violate the
"<a href="LNH.html">later no harm</a>" criterion
(plurality voting and forms of runoff elections and instant runoff voting) 
or only do so indirectly (such as Condorcet voting methods).
</blockquote><p>
which was completely ridiculous, and solely motivated by FairVote's backwards-directed
desire to "prove" Instant Runoff the greatest-ever possible voting method.
So might it be that I, as a known advocate of 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, am again merely working backwards
to prove my desired conclusion?  
</p><blockquote>
<b>Definition 1:</b>
For us "<b>Range voting</b>" shall mean the following voting method.
Each voter provides as her vote, a set of real number scores, each in [0,1],
one for each candidate.  The candidate with greatest score-sum, is elected.
</blockquote><p>
Well, rather remarkably given the
late date, this all is not nonsense &ndash; it is a <i>theorem</i>.
And perhaps the best explanation I can give for why it was previously overlooked, 
was because it was too obvious.
However, we must admit that
</p><ol type="a"><li>
It is a "theorem"
with a rather large asterisk attached about its applicability  (or that of its
underlying definitions) to the real world &ndash; we shall 
<a href="#theasterisk">explain</a> 
that in due time),
</li><li>
To achieve that, we need to make some precise definitions 
(or at least partial definitions) of
"single-winner voting systems," "good," and "criteria,"
which the reader might not adore.  I am perfectly happy with the first.
With the second, I only provide (and only need) 
a partial definition, but to the extent it
goes, I am ok with it modulo the later <a href="#theasterisk">asterisk</a>.
Finally to handle the third, we actually shall coin the new word "scriterion,"
note the "s," to signify we are speaking of a specific technical notion
of what voting-system criteria the <a href="#mainthm">Theorem</a>
is speaking about.  It does not speak about others.  
Our Theorem then potentially has various-strength versions,
with the stronger ones permitting wider "scriteria" notions.
(We'll initially start with a simple one, but some 
<a href="#strongerthm">strengthenings</a>
will be given later. Probably other strengthenings also could be devised.)
</li><li>
Note that our <a href="#mainthm">Theorem</a>
asserts only a <i>unidirectional</i> implication:
any scriterion disobeyed by range voting, cannot be a good scriterion.
It does <i>not</i> assert that any
scriterion obeyed by range voting <i>is</i> a good scriterion.
</li></ol>
<p>
Despite all those warnings and limitations, our Theorem remains quite remarkably
simple and powerful.
First of all, it affirms the pre-eminent position range voting holds 
among single-winner voting methods.
Second, many voting methods books have been published over the decades,
discussing many voting systems criteria, but none of them mentioned our Theorem.
And despite its limitations, this Theorem still is like a giant armed with a
shillelagh, smashing cruddy criteria right and left.  Plenty
of voting system criteria listed in those books, both 
</p><ol type="i"><li>
meet our technical requirements to be "scriteria," and 
</li><li>
now are instantly reduced to rubble.
</li></ol><p>
The "asterisk" attached to our Theorem can be quite bothering, but for practical purposes most
of the time does not bother us &ndash; that shillelagh still is doing
a hell of a lot of smashing, and few should be willing to dispute that.
</p><a name="mainthm"></a><p>
<b>THEOREM-WITH-<a href="#theasterisk">ASTERISK</a>:</b>
Only scriteria obeyed by range voting, can be good criteria for single-winner
voting systems to obey.
</p><p>
<b>Definition 2:</b>
A "<b>voting system</b>" shall mean a <i>function</i> F
mapping a set v of votes to the name w of a winner: w=F(v).
"Votes" are arbitrary information packets (e.g. bitstrings).
</p><a name="scrit1"</a><p>
<b>Definition 3:</b>
A "<b>scriterion</b>" specifies a set S of ordered pairs (x,y).
A voting system F "obeys" S
if the set of ordered pairs (v,w) with w=F(v) is a <i>subset</i> of S.
</p><p>
<b>Equivalent scriterion-obeyance notion:</b>
We instead could specify <i>complement(S)</i> (a set of "forbidden elections")
and demand the set of (v,w) from our
voting method have empty intersection with it.
</p><p>
<b>PROOF OF THE THEOREM:</b>
Consider the ideal voting system for superhuman honest voters:
"true utility voting" (TUV).  That is: each voter as her ballot states
the true utility,
for her, for each candidate's election, as an unrestricted real number
on some agreed-upon scale.
We elect the candidate maximizing utility-sum (summed over all voters).
The TUV system is not feasible in practice for actual humans for three reasons:
</p><ol><li>
There is no agreed-upon utility scale.
</li><li>
Even if there were, voters do not even know their own utilities.
</li><li>
Just one dishonest voter could give huge numbers,
singlehandedly throwing the election.
</li></ol><p>
But for <i>super</i>humans, TUV would be feasible, and would actually be the
unique best possible voting system in the sense it always would elect whatever option
maximized society-wide utility-sum.  (Zero <a href="BayRegDum.html">regret</a>.)
</p><p>
Therefore, only scriteria obeyed by TUV can be good scriteria
for single-winner voting systems to obey.  
Because any insistence on any other scriterion,
would immediately exclude the unique best voting system for superhumans,
as a matter of <i>foundational demand</i>.
That would be absurd and
would immediately brand the insistor as an idiot.
</p><blockquote>
The preceding paragraph can be viewed as a partial definition,
adequate for the purposes of this Proof, of "good."
We hereby brand any scriterion
failing to meet that goodness-requirement, as definitely "bad."
</blockquote><p>
Now for TUV and range voting,  F<sub>TUV</sub> 
is the <i>same</i> function as F<sub>range</sub>,
except that F<sub>range</sub> is restricted to a 
sub<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function">domain</a>.
</p><p>
Any scriterion obeyed by F<sub>TUV</sub> therefore
automatically is obeyed by F<sub>range</sub>.
</p><p>
Any scriterion <i>dis</i>obeyed by F<sub>range</sub>.
therefore automatically is disobeyed by F<sub>TUV</sub> 
and hence cannot be claimed to be a "good" criterion.
<!--(without the claimer looking like an idiot:)-->

<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p><b>Example 1</b>:
Consider this form of the <b>Condorcet-winner criterion</b>:
"whenever a candidate C exists who would defeat each rival pairwise in a
simple majority vote, then C must win."
Evidently this is a bad scriterion, since it is disobeyed
by range voting and TUV.  And indeed Fishburn already had made arguments against
Condorcet in 1974:
</p><center>
   <a href="FishburnAntiC.html">/FishburnAntiC.html</a>.
</center><p>
But range voting actually <i>does</i> obey the following
scriterion, which is a somewhat inequivalent
wording of the Condorcet criterion:
"whenever a candidate C exists who would defeat each rival X pairwise in a
vote with the same voting system but with all candidates besides C &amp; X
erased from all ballots, then C must win."
</p><p><b>Example 2</b>:
Consider this form of the <b>Majority-top criterion</b>:
"if &gt;50% of the votes rate some particular candidate C unique-top,
then C must win."
Again, this evidently is a bad scriterion, since it is disobeyed
by range voting and TUV. 
Unrelated arguments had also previously been made against majority-top, based on
the <a href="https://rangevoting.org/NSED.html">conjecture</a> that
any country using a system obeying it is at substantial risk of 
falling irreversibly into 2-party domination.
</p><p>
Range voting <i>does</i> obey this somewhat inequivalent wording of majority-top:
"if a majority of voters want to force X's election, they can."
This new wording, however, does not satisfy the requirements of the definition of "scriterion,"
nor even the below <i>k</i>th order variant for any particular k&ge;1.
</p><p><b>Example 3</b>: Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky's
"infinity criterion" (which TUV passes, but range voting fails)
"A voting method should not impose any finite bound on a voter's scores for candidates."
This would be a fine <i>counterexample</i> to our Theorem if we permitted as "criteria"
arbitrary English descriptions.  However, the Theorem  only permits
"scriteria" and this isn't a scriterion.  (It would have been a scriterion
if we replaced "should not impose any" with "must impose a" 
while demanding candidate-rating-style ballots,
in which case the Theorem would not have branded this as a "bad" scriterion,
nor would it have been a counterexample.)
</p><p><b>Example 4</b>:
Brams 2015's criterion forbidding the "<b>paradox of grading systems</b>"
is a "bad scriterion" according to our definitions, since
TUV disobeys it.
</p><p><b>Example 5</b>:
"<a href="LNH.html">Later no harm</a>" 
does not meet the demands of our 
above <a href="#scrit1">definition</a> of a "scriterion."
However, that problem is solved (proving LNH also is bad)
if we strengthen our Theorem by also allowing this wider
</p><a name="scrit2"></a><p>
<b>Definition 4</b> of "<b>2nd-order scriterion</b>":
A second-order scriterion S<sub>2</sub> is a set of 2-tuples
of ordered pairs (x,y).  A voting system F "obeys" it
if the set of 2-tuples 
</p><center>
<big>(</big>(v<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>), (v<sub>2</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>)<big>)</big>
</center><p>
of ordered pairs (v,w) with w=F(v), is a subset of S<sub>2</sub>.
</p><p>
We similarly may define "<b><i>k</i>th-order scriterion</b>" for any k&ge;1: just
replace "S<sub>2</sub>" by "S<sub>k</sub>" and "2-tuple" by "k-tuple."
</p><a name="scrit3"></a><p>
<b>Definition 5</b> of "<b>subdomain-invariant criterion</b>":
Any predicate concerning a voting system which, if true for voting system A,
necessarily also is true for voting system B whenever B's defining function is
the same as A's restricted to a subdomain.
</p><a name="strongerthm"></a><p>
<b>Strengthenings</b>:
The <a href="#mainthm">Theorem</a> 
(and its proof) still work if we replace the word "scriterion" in its
statement by "<i>k</i>th-order scriterion for any finite k&ge;1" or by
"subdomain-invariant criterion."
Also (pointed out by Ciaran Dougherty):
the theorem statement's "obeyed by range voting" can be strengthened to
"simultaneously obeyed by range, approval, and plurality voting."
</p><blockquote><small>
But Dougherty's strengthening comes with the further asterisk that a lot
of criteria in voting books,  are pretty much just not applicable to (or
at least <i>uninteresting</i> if you try to apply them to) approval
or especially to plurality. For example, if the criterion were discussing rank
orders...
</small></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="theasterisk"></a></p>
<b>THE ASTERISK:</b>
Since TUV was about honest voters ("superhumans"), the <a href="#mainthm">Theorem</a> 
presumably should not be applied concerning criteria that are about <i>strategy</i>.
It still is a valid theorem of mathematics, but our
justification for using the name "good" then would become dubious or vanish.
<p></p>
For example, 
"<a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> criteria" (FBC) or 
"<a href="TidemanRev.html#zihc">zero info honesty criterion</a>" (ZIH)
or the (much deprecated) "later no harm" criterion LNH
all arguably fall under the umbrella of this asterisk.
If we were to ignore this asterisk, then FBC would seem good as
far as the Theorem were concerned, while ZIH and LNH both would be bad.
