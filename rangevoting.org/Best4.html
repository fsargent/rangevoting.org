<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Regard this as "Part II" of the preceding 
<a href="BestVrange.html">Best Rank-Order Voting Systems versus Range Voting</a>.
We shall re-use notions, definitions, and understanding from Part I.
</p><p>
Part I gave methodology for provably identifying "best" voting systems
(measured via "Bayesian Regret") and used it to
<ol>
<li>
Identify the best rank-order-ballot voting system for honest voters
under the RNEM
("random normal elections model");
</li><li>
Show the superiority of "range voting" versus every rank-order-ballot
voting system in 3-candidate RNEM elections,
for any mixture of honest and strategic voters.
</li></ol>
We now go further by identifying the pseudo-best rank-order-ballot voting system 
for <I>strategic</I> voters in N-candidate elections.
(This is under the RNEM, and for a certain kind of "strategic voting" we call the 
"moving-average strategy"; here "pseudo-best" means, essentially, that the voting system
is best for strategic voters who all have independent
random notions of the presumed winning
chances of the candidates. "Best" and "pseudo-best" coincide 
if N&le;3. Severe difficulties arise if one tries to handle "best" for N&ge;4.
Readers unhappy with the "pseudo-best" concept can console themselves with our
<a href="#Thm1">theorem</a>
that "pseudo-best rank-order system" and "best weighted-positional system"
mean the same thing under the RNEM.)
At least if the issue of "best" versus "pseudo-best" is ignored,
we show the superiority of Range Voting over every rank-order system
for <i>any</i> number N of candidates with 3&le;N&le;31 for V&rarr;&infin;
<i>honest</i> voters, and also for <i>strategic</I> voters,
and finally if 3&le;N&le;9
for any <a href="#Plots">mixture</a> of honest and strategic voters.
We also <a href="#Tab1">tabulate</a> the RNEM Bayesian Regrets and "wrong winner probabilities"
of these and other voting systems, for many values of N, to about 4 decimals.
Finally, we
examine the N&rarr;&infin; limit, showing that all <i>sufficiently large</i> N, 
honest range voting has regret which in the limit
is <i>zero</i> relative to that of "random winner," whereas various
other voting methods like Approval and Borda have asymptotically <i>non</i>zero 
relative regret; 
and strategic range=approval
voting has asymptotic regret which is a constant factor times <i>smaller</i> than that of
random winner, although certain other voting methods (e.g. plurality) with
strategic voting have asymptotically the <i>same</i> regret as random winner.
</p><p>
All our results can be or are proven in fully rigorous mathematical style <i>except</I>
<ol type="A">
<li>
The results with N&le;31 depend on   
certain numerical integrations;
</li><li>
We show that the regret of range voting is less than the regret of the best rank-order system
by plotting two regret-versus-electorate-composition curves, and seeing one curve always 
is above the other.
</li></ol>
While this level of rigor seems good enough for the purposes of economists and 
political scientists,
it falls short of the standards of ultrapure mathematicians.  
Part I had already outlined 
mechanical methods
for converting proofs of this sort to full rigor. 
We show how those techniques can be extended to also work here, but we
have not, and 
doing so would be even more painful here than in Part I, especially for larger N.

<h3>1. Introduction
</h3>

<p>
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a>
had explained the "correlation based procedure" for 
computing Bayesian Regrets in the V&rarr;&infin; limit of V-voter RNEM elections
for a large variety of voting systems.  
Two kinds of multidimensional integration problems arose inside
that procedure:
<ol>
<li>
Computing "correlations" and "variances";
</li><li>
Computing "regrets" and/or "wrong-winner probabilities."
</li>
</ol>
In Part I, we evaluated the correlations and variances for many voting systems
(including range voting and the best-rank-order-ballot and best-ratings-ballot systems) in
3-candidate elections as <i>closed formulas</i> involving mathematical constants
such as &pi;.  
We then used those formulas to evaluate the regrets and wrong-winner probabilities
by either numerical or symbolic integration (indeed, we showed how all these 
could also be done
symbolically in closed form, but in some cases the formulas are large).
</p><p>
But it is possible instead to do both kinds of integration numerically.  
If we employ the simplest kind of numerical integration procedure &ndash; 
Monte Carlo integration &ndash;
we then get a quite simple computer program adequate to reach 4-decimal accuracy
for all numbers N of candidates with 3&le;N&le;31.
</p><p>
There is one problem, though.
If correlation matrices are computed using inexact numerical-integration methods
rather than exact formulas, they can sometimes
fail to be positive definite.   (But of course, genuine
correlation matrices are always positive definite symmetric,
and with 1s in each diagonal entry.)
Most of the time, this is not a problem,
which is because, as a consequence of "Gershgorin's circle theorem"
from linear algebra, any sufficiently small-norm symmetric perturbation of a positive definite
symmetric matrix, still is positive definite.  <i>However</i>, as we saw in Part I,
many voting methods yield "degenerate" aka "reduced-rank" correlation matrices, which
are merely positive <i>semi</i>definite.  For them, an arbitrarily small 
perturbation <i>always</i> exists which moves us outside of the domain of positive definite
matrices!   With indefinite correlation matrices, we're dead &ndash;
the whole "correlation based procedure"
from <a href="BestVrange.html#Sec5">section 5 of Part I</a> grinds to a halt.
</p><p>
This obstacle can be dodged in those cases (such as "weighted positional" voting systems 
with 100% honest voters) where exact formulas are available giving every entry
of the correlation matrices (see <a href="BestVrange.html#Sec51">section 5.1 of Part I</a>).
It occasionally struck in other cases, but I was able, by either perturbing the matrix entries by
a fixed perturbation by at most a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, or by
doing several re-runs with 
different random seeds (or both), to avoid
this problem in every case.
</p><p>
An engineer, confronted with this problem, might apply a numerical method
(e.g. Higham 2002 &amp; 2008) for replacing a putative correlation matrix by the nearest matrix
which genuinely <i>is</i> positive definite symmetric with unit diagonal, thus "repairing"
the problem. 
However, in this paper I am trying to be a mathematician, not an engineer,
and my goal is to <i>prove</i> statements about optimal
Bayesian Regrets of voting methods &ndash;
or at least, provide an incomplete proof which we show could be
mechanically completed, by carrying out certain 
computations with "interval arithmetic" 
starting from rigorous error bounds &ndash; this
is a lesser
standard of "proof" which I regard as still adequate for many purposes.
Some kinds of computations &ndash; 
e.g. carried out by "bounded depth arithmetic circuits"
&ndash; are clearly going to work well with interval arithmetic.  But it is <i>not</i> 
immediately clear
that would be the case for Higham's algorithm, which involves a fairly complicated
matrix process iterated to convergence.
I want everything to be maximally simple.
I therefore have abstained from these kinds of repair-attempt here.
</p><p>
The output of the program is given in <a href="#Tab1">table 1</a>.
<i>If</i> the random number generators are trusted, then "Chernoff bounds" show (for all the
integration problems here) "exponential tails," which means we can be highly confident the numbers
the computerized Monte-Carlo
outputs, are not far from the truth.  Based on various re-run checks, we believe the standard
errors in all numbers are at most a few units in the last decimal place.

<b>Table 1.</b>
<b>Wrong winner percentages</b> and <b>V<sup>-1/2</sup>Regrets</b> for voting methods under
N-candidate V-voter RNEM with V&rarr;&infin;.
Values were computed 
either from exact formulas and/or by correlation-based procedure using separate
Monte Carlo integrations to compute <i>both</i> correlations and regrets.
(For N&le;3, see 
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a>.)  
Honest Range Voting is superior (i.e. has less regret)
to the best rank-order voting system for each N with 3&le;N&le;31.
If we instead have strategic voters, then the same thing happens (at least, if 
the distinction between
"pseudo-best" and "best" is ignored)
indicated by comparing
"strategic approval=range"
versus the strategic rank-order systems.
When N=4, strategic range voting
is also superior to the best "semi-strategic" rank-order system, which is "top-2" voting.

<b>NOTES ABOUT THE TABLE:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>How to make the table-entries rigorous via a mechanical computation:</b>
It would be possible in principle &ndash; we have not done it, but a sufficiently 
determined reader could, at least for small Ns &ndash;
to employ <i>rigorous</i> numerical integration techniques to
replace every number in table 1 with arbitrarily tight rigorous upper and lower bounds.
That is because all of our integrals are integrating standard Gaussians times linear functions
of the coordinates, over certain polytopal-cone regions.   Those integrands are well behaved
because 
they have both rapidly decreasing tails and also
easily-computed |derivative| bounds.  Therefore numerical integration
via summation over lattice points inside a big ball, will produce an answer whose error
is boundable using (a) the derivative bounds, (b) tail mass-bound for integral outside
the ball, (c) by using "interval arithmetic" to cover errors caused
by inexact arithmetic.
The second integration to find regrets and wrong-winner probabilities
employs the results of the first integration (to find correlations, etc.)
inside its integrand.  Therefore errors in the earlier results will contaminate the 
later ones, but since these can be incorporated inside the interval arithmetic they will not
ruin anything.
</p>
<p>
By <b>semi-strategic</b> voting in a 4-candidate election, we
mean this.  Before the election begins,
two candidates are (randomly) named by God as the two "frontrunners." 
The voters now vote the maximum-allowed vote for whichever of these two they prefer 
and the minimum-allowed vote for the other.
(This is intended to maximize the vote's "impact" on the 
frontrunner-vs-frontrunner race, the only pairoff 
that, they believe, probably matters.)   Then, 
they vote honestly about the two remaining candidates
(i.e. rank them honestly relative to each other, and subject to the constraint that
the two frontrunners are artificially ranked top and bottom).
With semi-strategic voters, we shall prove in <a href="#Thm3">theorem 3</a>
that the best rank-order-ballot voting system for 4-candidate RNEM (V&rarr;&infin;)-voter 
elections, is <b>"top-2"</b> voting,
i.e. the weighted positional system with weights <nobr>(+1, +1, -1, -1).</nobr>
</p><p>
The notion of <b>strategic</b> voting we shall examine in this paper is the 
<b>moving-average strategy:</b>
Before the election begins,
<b>"God"</b> randomly chooses, and publicizes,
an ordering of the candidates from presumably-most-likely-to-win to
presumably-least.   (The two most-likely are the two "frontrunners.")
Each voter now votes the maximum-allowed vote for whichever of the frontrunners she prefers
and the minimum-allowed for the other.
She then proceeds down the rest of God's ordering in decreasing-presumed-likelihood order,
giving each candidate either the maximum- or minimum-allowed vote
(subject to the constraint that the vote still be legal according to the rules of 
the voting system, given all her preceding decisions)
<i>depending</i> on whether its utility (for that voter)
exceeds or is less than the average-utility among the
preceding candidates.
</p><p>
<b>Notation:</b>
Many rows in <a href="#Tab1">table 1</a>
consider the effect of <i>mis-using</i> our optimal voting systems.
For example, if we find the best rank-order voting system for strategic voters, we could
consider what happens if non-strategic, i.e. honest, rank-order voters employ that method
instead &ndash; see line 5 of the
<a href="#Tab1">table</a>.
Or conversely, what happens if strategic voters try to
employ the rank-order voting system (which had been stated and derived in
<a href="BestVrange.html#Sec6">section 6 of Part I</a>)
that is best for honest voters? &ndash; see line 15.
</p><p>
Semi-strategic voting, since it is partially honest, might intuitively be expected to yield
regret lower than fully-strategic voting.
Line 10 and 12 of <a href="#Tab1">table 1</a>
confirm this conjecture in 4-candidate RNEM (V&rarr;&infin;)-voter elections &ndash;
but note from line 7 that even the best semi-strategic <i>rank-order</i>
voting system still has worse regret than fully-strategic
4-candidate <i>range voting</i> (which in turn has worse regret than honest range voting).
<!--</p><p>Ordering: by increasing regret when=4 -->
</p><p>
<b>FIRST MAIN RESULT &ndash; THE SUPERIORITY OF RANGE VOTING:</b>
<br>
Table 1 (and our other, unprinted, calculations of the same ilk when 10&le;N&le;30)
indicate that for each number N of candidates with 3&le;N&le;31
<i>range voting is superior</i> (i.e. has less regret, in the V&rarr;&infin; voter RNEM) 
to the best rank-order system
<i>both</i> for fully-honest <i>and</i> for fully-strategic voters &ndash;
at least, if the distinction between "best" and "pseudo-best" is ignored, otherwise
we still may conclude range's superiority versus the best <i>weighted-positional</i> system.
</p><p>
<b>Honest-strategic voter mixtures:</b>
Based on that one would guess that when 3&le;N&le;31
range is superior to the best rank-order
voting system for any <i>mixture</i> of H-fraction honest and (1-H)-fraction strategic
voters(every H with 0&le;H&le;100%).
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a> had confirmed that guess for N=3 candidates.
This paper shall confirm it also for every N with 4&le;N&le;9,
but things get a little trickier.
The difficulty is that, with N=3 
Part I had shown Borda voting to be a best rank-order voting system,
<i>regardless</i> of whether we have honest voters,
strategic voters, or any mixture.  
But when 4&le;N the (pseudo)best rank-order voting system <i>depends</i> on H.
</p><p>
<b>Further plans:</B>
<a href="#Sec6">Section 6</a>
explicitly identifies the pseudo-best 
rank-order voting system for an honest+strategic voter H-mixture.
When 4&le;N&le;9, it never is Borda for any value of H; but Borda does nearly as well as these
best systems especially for small N and high H.  
Substantially greater regret for Borda versus the pseudo-best rank-order system
is only seen (for honest voters) at fairly large N, e.g. N=31.
</p><p>
We then <a href="#Plots">plot</a>
regret-versus-H for both range voting and the (pseudo)best rank-order voting system
to verify range's superiority at a glance [since the range-regret curve lies below the
(pseudo)best-rank-order-curve for every H].
The same numerical methods used to compute <a href="#Tab1">table 1</a>
are re-used in constructing these plots.  Again, by use of interval arithmetic and rigorous
numerical integration, one could in principle mechanically convert all these curve-plots
to fully-rigorous proofs, but we have not done so.
</p><p>
Finally, <a href="#Sec7">section 7</a>
then considers the limit N&rarr;&infin; of a large number of candidates, and
proves theorems about the asymptotic behavior of the regrets of various voting methods.
</p>

<a name="Sec2"></a>
<h3>2. Pseudo-best vs Best</h3>
<p>
If one tries to find the "best" rank-order voting system for 
moving-average-type strategic voters, one encounters difficulties.  
The problem is that the voting
system can know (or deduce from the strategic ballots with very high probability 
when V&rarr;&infin; of
making a correct deduction)
"God's order."
Once it has acquired this knowledge, the voting system can then attempt to compensate
for the strategic ballots by acting in an "unfair" way, i.e. by treating different candidates
unequally.  For example, God's two "frontrunner" candidates, even when ranked first
by a voter, presumably would  <i>not</i> 
be given the maximum number of points by the best weighted-positional
voting system &ndash; and
candidates ranked differently by God would be
treated differently by the voting system handling any particular ballot.
This kind of voting system seems unacceptable in practice because it <i>assumes</i> voters
are dishonest/strategic.   Well, of course, that was the whole point&ndash; but 
what if some voter actually is honest? In that case the voting system
often would artificially re-rank her top-ranked candidate non-top, "refusing to accept"
and "altering" her honest vote because "it knows she is lying"!
This kind of behavior simply does not seem politically acceptable.
</p><p>
For this reason, it seems better to ask for "pseudo-best" rank-order voting systems.
These minimize Bayesian Regret under the assumption that the voters 
(1) use moving-average strategy, (2) each voter does that under an independent and
random notion of what "God's order" is.
Pseudo-best voting systems treat all candidates equally.
</p><p>
However, when we actually <i>evaluate BR</i> for a pseudo-best voting system, we shall
employ the usual assumption that there is only <i>one</i> "God's order" and all the
voters use it as the basis for their strategy.
Note that the assumptions used when optimizing the voting system design and
the assumptions used when evaluating that design <i>differ</i>.
This is the whole point of "pseudobest" versus "best."
I admit it is somewhat artificial but I did not see any better way to proceed.
</p><p>
The best versus pseudo-best issue did not arise in
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a> because the best and pseudo-best
rank-order voting systems in 3-candidate elections are the <i>same</i> (both Borda).
However when we have N&ge;4 candidates as in the present paper, they differ.
<a href="#Sec3">Section 3</a>
explicitly identifies the pseudo-best 
rank-order voting system for moving-average-type strategic voters 
in N-candidate RNEM elections.
</p><p>
<b>More detailed look:</b>
The <b>truly best</b> voting system for strategic voters would have a <i>matrix</i> M of
weights such that a candidate would receive score M<sub>ij</sub> if
a voter ranked him <i>i</i>th while God's ordering ranked him <i>j</i>th.
It would be possible in principle (but we shall not do it) to compute the
optimum matrix &ndash; in which M<sub>ij</sub> was the expected utility of the candidate
ranked <i>i</i>th by our (assumed strategic) voter and <i>j</i>th by God &ndash;
and then to compute the Bayesian Regret of the resulting voting system using the
correlation-based technology from 
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a>.
</p><p>
I consider such matrix-voting systems morally unacceptable:  the winner ought to 
depend <i>entirely</I>
on the votes and <i>not at all</i> on 
a priori
perceptions from "God" of likelihoods of winning.
But even if we were to accept this kind of voting system, 
we then would encounter a different problem
as soon as we tried to use it:
how would we decide what "God's order" was to be?
The different candidates doubtlessly would argue and sue each other and the election authority
endlessly to try to manipulate their 
position in it.
</p><p>
If we demand that the voting system employ <i>absolutely no</i> information about "God's order"
we presumably should have it act as though all God-orderings
are exactly equally likely.
Unfortunately the voting system, in its quest to optimize societal utility, could try to "outwit"
such restrictions by "deducing" God's ordering from the votes themselves, <i>then</i> using
the full matrix M.   If we forbid that and demand that it <i>really</I> act as
though all God-orderings
are exactly equally likely, then
the optimal (as-restricted) voting system for strategic voters 
&ndash; the <b>pseudo-best</b> voting system &ndash;
must be a <i>weighted positional</i> system with weights 
W<sub>i</sub>&prop;&sum;<sub>j</sub>M<sub>ij</sub>.
</p><p>
Equivalently, we could simply <i>demand</i> a weighted positional voting system, 
in which case the best weights for strategic voters (maximizing societal utility) will 
yield the (genuinely)
<i>best</I> weighted positional voting system.   So, to summarize the outcome of
the  preceding argumentation as a "theorem" (albeit that may be a misnomer since
it is somewhat in the nature of a "definition"):
</p>
<a name="#Thm1"></a><p>
<b>THEOREM 1 (PseudoBest Rank Order=Best Weighted Positional):</b>
The best weighted positional voting system
(i.e. 
minimizing Bayesian Regret for strategic voters under some model of strategic voter behavior)
is the <i>same thing</i>
as the pseudo-best rank-order-ballot voting system.
</p><p>
Before the reader dances off into the sunset
feeling that the "pseudobest" definition has evaded all problems...
there can still be one more problem:
With some voter strategic behaviors, the "best" weighted positional system could actually
have <i>greater</I> weights for the second-ranked candidate than the top-ranked one!
In that case, the voters of course would no longer <i>use</i> that strategic behavior
in reality &ndash; they'd e.g. switch to ranking their true-favorite "second." The problem here
is not that the "best weighted positional" = "pseudobest" definition is wrong; it is
that whatever underlying 
voter strategic behavior model was used, was unrealistic.   We shall encounter
this exact difficulty in <a href="#Sec3">section 3</a> and propose a cure involving 
averaging weights in increasing-weight blocks.
</p>

<a name="Sec3"></a>
<h3>3. Best rank-order voting system for strategic voters
(especially using "moving-average" strategy)
</h3>

<p>
We begin by considering a very wide class of voter "strategies" &ndash;
not just the ones Part I had been considering based on the assumption by voters that
everybody besides two known "frontrunner" candidates had negligible winning chances.
Instead allow voters to use <i>any</i> function F to  determine their
votes from candidate-utilities and
pre-published information about the candidates and their estimated election chances.
Call a voting system <b>fair</b> if it treats all candidates and voters equally, i.e.
is symmetric under reordering of either.  (Previous authors have called fair voting methods
"anonymous and neutral.")  We shall only consider fair voting systems in the rest of
this paper.
</p>
<a name="UndPrinc"></a>
<p><b>UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE 
(optimality of weighted positional under very wide class of voter strategies):</b>
<br>
It should be obvious to any reader who has understood the logical flows in 
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a>
(see especially its sections 1 and 6)
that  the optimum (regret minimizing) fair rank-order voting method in the RNEM with
V&rarr;&infin; voters is a
<i>weighted positional</i> system in which the weight for the <i>k</i>th-ranked candidate
is the <i>expected utility</i> of that candidate for a random voter
under the RNEM, <i>conditioned</i>
on F producing a rank-ordering ranking him <i>k</i>th.
These weights are just a certain set of constants which can be computed once and for all given
the definition F of voter strategy.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remark:</b>
In consequence, I would expect Approval voting to still provably be superior to every
rank-order voting system,
for most reasonable strategy notions, for any mixture of honest and strategic voters,
in 3-candidate RNEM elections.
(However, we are intentionally leaving <i>that</i>
somewhat vague; the reader will have to check
it for any particular strategy notion.)
</p><p>
We now drop total generality to focus on the moving-average strategy.
</p><p>
<b>Incidental Observation (last-ranked's utility almost irrelevant):</b>
In any rank-order-ballot voting system, voters employing the moving-average strategy
will produce a rank for God's last-numbered candidate which is, under the RNEM, 
<i>uncorrelated with and independent of</I> the utility of that candidate
(since this vote is determined purely by the utilities of the <i>other</i> N-1 candidates)!
More difficulties with correlation matrices will be discussed next section.
</p><p>
<b>A useful sequence Q<sub>k</sub>:</b>
To identify the best fair rank-order voting system for this kind of strategic voter, 
a useful sequence of quantities to know are
Q<sub>k</sub>,
the expected utility of a candidate, <i>conditioned</i> on
a voter regarding him as having greater utility than the average-utility of k-1 given other
candidates.
I.e, Q<sub>k</sub> is the expected value of a standard normal deviate 
conditioned on the fact it is greater than the average of
k-1 other independent such deviates.
If 2&le;k this is, as a k-dimensional integral over a halfspace, 
</p>
<center>
Q<sub>k</sub>
=
2&int;&int;&hellip;&int;<sub>(k-1)x<sub>k</sub>&ge;(x<sub>1</sub>+&hellip;+x<sub>k-1</sub>)</sub> 
x<sub>k</sub>P(x<sub>1</sub>)P(x<sub>2</sub>)&hellip;P(x<sub>k</sub>)
dx<sub>1</sub>dx<sub>2</sub>&hellip;dx<sub>k</sub>.
</center>
<p>
where P(x)=(2&pi;)<sup>-1/2</sup>exp(-x<sup>2</sup>/2)
denotes the standard normal density function.
We can evaluate the integral immediately by rotating the coordinate system so that one of
the axes becomes perpendicular to the hyperplane 
</p>
<center>
(k-1)x<sub>k</sub>=x<sub>1</sub>+&hellip;+x<sub>k-1</sub>.
</center>
<p>
In that case the integrals over all the other k-1 directions can be replaced by just the value
at the origin, so the k-dimensional integral becomes 1-dimensional, with value
</p>
<center>
Q<sub>k</sub>
&nbsp; = &nbsp; 
2[(k-1)/k]<sup>1/2</sup>&int;<sub>0&le;x&lt;&infin;</sub>xP(x)dx
&nbsp; = &nbsp; 
[2(k-1)/(&pi;k)]<sup>1/2</sup>.
</center>

<b>THEOREM 2 (Best rank-order systems for strategic voters):</b>
For V voters employing the moving-average strategy, the best (i.e. least expected regret) fair
rank-order voting system under the RNEM in the V&rarr;&infin; limit is, for 2&le;N&lt;&infin;,
the weighted-positional system whose weights are
in decreasing order
S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup> for
1&le;J&le;N.
We have
S<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=Q<sub>2</sub>
while
for 2&le;J&le;&lfloor;N/2&rfloor; they are given by this formula
</p>
<center>
S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
&nbsp; = &nbsp; 
[T<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup> - T<sub>N+1-J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>]
<font size="+3">/</font>
[B<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup> + B<sub>N+1-J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>]
</center>
where
<center>
T<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
&nbsp; = &nbsp;
&sum;<sub>J&le;k&lt;N</sub> Q<sub>k+1</sub>2<sup>-k</sup>binomial(k-2, J-2)
,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
&nbsp; = &nbsp;
&sum;<sub>J&le;k&lt;N</sub> 2<sup>-k</sup>binomial(k-2, J-2) 
</center>
<p>
and for J&ge;&lceil;N/2&rceil; we can get the weights from the negation symmetry
S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>+S<sub>N+1-J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=0.
Here 
binomial(b,a)=b!/[a!&middot;(b-a)!]
where 0!=1. 
</p>
<p>
<b>CAVEAT:</b>
<i>However</i>, when N&ge;6 these weights S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
need to be "adjusted" to cure the "disease" that some of them increase with J,
see text below.
<p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
The sum-based formula also gives the right answer for S<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup> 
provided binomial(a,b) with negative a or b are interpreted in the correct limiting sense.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof (of Theorem as supplemented by Caveat):</b>
From linearity of expectations we have that
&sum;<sub>1&le;J&le;N</sub>S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=0.
From negation symmetry we have
S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>+S<sub>N+1-J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=0 for 1&le;J&le;N.
From the first step in the definition of the moving-average strategy, we have
S<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=Q<sub>2</sub>.
Now the remaining weights not yet determined by these relations are
S<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
for
2&le;J&le;&lfloor;N/2&rfloor;.
For these we argue as follows.  
Why would our strategic voter rank a candidate <i>J</i>th?
If she ranked all except <i>i</i> (i&ge;0)
of the J-2+i candidates numbered m=3,...,J+i 
(where m numbers them in "God's order")
maximum, then also ranked God's <i>(J+i+1)</i>th-numbered candidate
maximum, then that <i>(J+i+1)</i>th-numbered candidate would be ranked <i>J</i>th in
the voter's strategic rank-ordering and would have expected utility Q<sub>J+i+1</sub>,
and this event would occur with probability proportional to 
<nobr>2<sup>2-J-i</sup>binomial(J-2+i, i)</nobr>.
The powers of 2 come from the fact that each question of the form "does candidate X's
utility lie above or below the average of the preceding candidates?" is
an unbiased coin flip.  The binomials come from the fact that the probability
that N coin flips yield exactly Z heads is 
<nobr>2<sup>-N</sup>binomial(N,Z).</nobr>
Now use 
<nobr>binomial(b,b-a)=binomial(b,a)</nobr>
and let k=J+i to get the claimed formula
for T<sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>.
</p><p>
It is also possible for <i>J</i>th rankings to arise
via voters who rank that candidate <i>min</i>imum, in which case 
the same formula arises "thinking negated" where the <i>J</i>th-ranking
from top corresponds to the <i>N+1-J</i>th ranking from bottom.
Between these we have accounted for every possibility.
(The denominator just comes from normalizing the probability distribution; and since
we may multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same arbitrary constant, we
use that to simplify the exponents in the power of 2.)
</p>
<p>
This causes the best voting system for strategic voters in <b>2-candidate</b> RNEM elections to
be weighted positional with weights 
<nobr>(Q<sub>2</sub>, -Q<sub>2</sub>),</nobr>
which when rescaled by &radic;&pi; is
<nobr>(+1, -1),</nobr> 
i.e. simple plurality voting.
Similarly the
best voting system for strategic voters in <b>3-candidate</b> RNEM elections has
weights 
<nobr>(Q<sub>2</sub>, 0, -Q<sub>2</sub>),</nobr>
which when rescaled by &radic;&pi; is
<nobr>(+1, 0, -1),</nobr> 
i.e. Borda voting.
</p>
<p>
We already knew both these facts from 
<a href="BestVrange.html">Part I</a>, but for
<b>4-candidate</b> RNEM elections we move into new territory
with the "root3 voting system."
Its weights [rescaled by (3&pi;)<sup>1/2</sup>] are <nobr>(&radic;3, 1, -1, -&radic;3).</nobr>
<p>
Incidentally, note that root3 voting 
is the first example (N=4)
where the best weighted-positional voting
systems for honest and for strategic voters <i>differ</I>.
</p>
<p>
One can now continue on trying
to derive the best rank-order voting systems for strategic RNEM voters
for N-candidate elections for <nobr>N=5,6,7,&hellip;</nobr>
We always get a weighted positional system, whose weights 
are certain rational linear combinations of the Q<sub>j</sub>.
When <b>N=5</b> they are [rescaled by <nobr>8(3&pi;)<sup>1/2</sup></nobr>]
</p>
<center>
(8&radic;3, 8+3&radic;2, 0, -8-3&radic;2, -8&radic;3)
</center>
<p>
However, a funny thing happens when <b>N=6</b> (and presumably for all N&ge;6):
we find that 
S<sub>2</sub><sup>(N)</sup>&gt;S<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup>!
That would mean that a voter would be better off ranking
her favorite frontrunner <i>second</i> rather than first...
contradicting the 
validity and whole underlying rationale of
the "best rank-order voting system for strategic voters."
Presumably the right <b>cure</b> for this is to replace any 
increasing block of weights by their averages 
&ndash; albeit when N gets larger 
that just leads to further 
diseases, see <a href="#Tab2">table 2</a>, which require more curing.
With the cures suggested there &ndash;
namely that each <i>block</i> of B non-decreasing weights needs to be replaced by B
repetitions of its mean, and this adjustment needs to be re-done until the weights
form a non-increasing sequence &ndash;
the resulting voting system will have the property under the RNEM that
a candidate who receives score X from a strategic voter, will, in fact,
then have expected utility X. 
(This iterative adjustment process must terminate/converge since each adjustment <i>decreases</i>
the sum of the squares of the weights, hence the process cannot "loop forever.")
That property justifies our claim that the voting system is
"optimal" for this kind of voter &ndash; it elects the candidate with the greatest expected
(conditioned on the votes) utility.
<b>QED.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Must "best voting methods for strategic voters" <i>exist?</i></b>
We have seen that they exist in the RNEM for <i>moving-average strategy</i> with N&ge;2
candidates and V&rarr;&infin; voters.
But it is not clear to me that they must exist in <i>general.</i>
The problem is this.  Our 
"<a href="#UndPrinc">underlying principle</a>"
makes it clear that for any F
defining the strategic behavior, a unique best voting system will exist under
the V&rarr;&infin; RNEM, <i>but</i>
it might happen that that voting system is such that F no longer 
constitutes "sensible strategy."  One could, of course, then alter F to make it "more
sensible" and then see what voting system results, and then alter F again, and so on.
The problem is: this
iterative process might enter an infinite loop and never terminate.
So my current answer to this question is "sometimes, but perhaps not always."
</p>
<p>
<b>More general (albeit perhaps mysterious) remark:</b>
it is well known that there is no such thing as "best strategy"
if one attempts to generalize Von Neumann "game theory" to games with more than 2 players.
So the whole question does not really make sense.   "Nash equilibrium" is an attempt to
salvage game theory which often is useful, but for the purposes of voting theorists in
large elections, is extremely useless.  [For example,
an election  in which every voter votes for the 
agreed-by-all-to-be-worst candidate "Hitler," who wins...
is a "Nash equilibrium."]
</p><p>
This explains why we are always focusing on some specific voter behavior F as a strategy
(e.g. the moving-average strategy) instead of enquiring what <i>is</i>
"the best strategy" &ndash;
there is no such thing.

<b>THEOREM 3 (Best Semi-Strategic Rank-Order=Top-2):</b>
The best (regret-minimizing)
semi-strategic voting system, under the RNEM with V&rarr;&infin; voters,
in 4-candidate elections, is "top-2" voting, i.e. the
weighted positional system with weights
proportional to (+1, +1, -1, -1).
</p><p>
<b>Proof:</b>
By our <a href="#UndPrinc">underlying principle</a> from section 2,
it has to be weighted positional with weights proportional
to expected utilities (in the eyes of any given voter) conditioned on that voter's vote.
Because of our postulate/definition 
that "God" chooses the two frontrunners (and two non-frontrunners)
randomly in a way unrelated to 
all voters' utilities, and because of our definition of "semi-strategic" voting, 
the two frontrunners and two non-frontrunners are exactly symmetric, so their
weights must be the same, and by translation and scaling we can make them be (+1,-1).

<p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
Note that in all the cases above, det(CC<sup>T</sup>)=0 so that the vote-vote
correlation matrix CC<sup>T</sup> is <i>not</i> positive-definite; it
is merely semidefinite.  A zero-eigenvalue eigenvector is (1,1,0,...,0),
but this is not bothersome since strategic voters always vote (x,-x) in
the first two coordinates and hence never "activate" this eigenvector.
</p><p>
A much more annoying indefiniteness problem occurs with
5-candidate psubest-strategic-rank-order voting,
<pre>
      [ 1.0000 -1.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 ]
      [-1.0000  1.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 ]
CC<sup>T</sup> = [ 0.0000  0.0000  1.0000 -0.7071 -0.7071 ]
      [ 0.0000  0.0000 -0.7071  1.0000  0.0000 ]
      [ 0.0000  0.0000 -0.7071  0.0000  1.0000 ]
</pre>
where the exact formula for 0.7071 is 2<sup>-1/2</sup>.
This also has det(CC<sup>T</sup>)=0, arising from the unique eigenvector with
zero eigenvalue, which is <nobr>e=(0, 0, &radic;2, 1, 1).</nobr>
The reason this is much more annoying is that voters <i>always</i> vote in ways non-orthogonal
to this eigenvector, and hence with vote-utility correlation matrices generated by approximate 
Monte-Carlo methods, there is a decent probability
that the "correlation based procedure" from part I
will try to Cholesky-factor a matrix with a negative eigenvalue &ndash; which, 
of course, is
impossible.
</p><P>
Experiments with the Monte-Carlo code showed, however, that 
<ol type="">
<li>
Mixing in even a small percentage of honest voters always seems to cure the indefiniteness problem.
</li><li>
With 100% strategic voters, we (usually, depending on the random seed)
can "adjust" the vote-utility correlation matrix by a tiny perturbation of order
10<sup>-9</sup> in each entry
(i.e. well below the levels of random noise from Monte Carlo)
to make it become positive definite.
</ol>
</p><P>
This same problem arose in other cases too, but the same fix has always worked
in our experience so far.

<h3>5. Some remarks on some other voting systems
</h3>

<p>
Alan Gibbard, in his proof of his version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, 
focused attention on the following two randomized voting methods, which, he showed,
were the unique two "strategy-proof" rank-order voting systems (and probabilistic mixtures
of these two):
<ol>
<li> <b>Random ballot:</b>
A ballot is selected at random, and the winner is the candidate it ranks top.
</li>
<li> <b>Random pair:</b>
A pair of candidates (call them A  and B)
are selected at random. 
All other candidates besides A &amp; B are eliminated.
The winner is whoever wins the
A versus B simple-majority vote based on the ballots.
</li>
</ol>
In other words, strategic and honest voting, in these two 
lottery-voting systems, are the same thing.
</p>
<a name="Thm4"></a>
<p><b>THEOREM 4:</b>
Under the RNEM with V&rarr;&infin; voters, "random ballot" has the same 
regret as "random winner."
Also, "random pair" has the same regret as "strategic plurality voting."
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b> is immediate from
the definition of the RNEM and our model of strategic plurality
voting.
<b>QED.</b>
</p>

<p>
In the real world, our model of the two "frontrunners" being "selected randomly by God"
is not completely correct.
I suspect, indeed, that the two frontrunners have better quality on average than 
random candidates.  (But this certainly is not <i>always</i> the case. For example,
two US presidents often selected by historians as the "worst" are George W. Bush and 
Warren G. Harding.  It is hard to believe that their respective third-party opponents
Ralph Nader and Eugene V. Debs would have made worse presidents than them.  Debs was actually
a political <i>prisoner</i> at the time of the election but 
Harding, once elected, pardoned him.)
If so, then random pair in the real world presumably would have <i>worse</i> regret than
strategic plurality voting.
</p>

<h3>6. (Pseudo)Best rank-order voting system for strategic+honest voter mixture
</h3>

<a name="Thm5"></a>
<p>
<b>THEOREM 5 (Best rank-order system for honest+strat voter mix):</b>
The pseudo-best <!--(i.e. regret-minimizing) -->
rank-order voting system in N-candidate elections
in the V&rarr;&infin; voter RNEM with a mixture of H-fraction 
honest and (1-H)-fraction strategic, voters, is weighted positional
with weights 
<center>
H&middot;G<sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup>+(1-H)<u>S</u><sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
</center>
where G<sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup> from 
<a href="BestVrange.html#AppA">Part I's appendix A</a> are the optimum weights for
honest voters, and 
<u>S</u><sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup> from our <a href="#Thm2">theorem 2</a>
are the optimum weights for
strategic voters.
</p>
<p>
The <b>proof</b>
is immediate from the 
<a href="#UndPrinc">underlying principle</a>
from <a href="#Sec3">section 3</a>.
</p><p>
With the optimum voting system known, we then can employ the known methodology from
<a href="BestVrange.html#Sec8">section 8 of Part I</a>
to evaluate its Bayesian regret for an H:1-H honest+strategic
voter mixture.  When I did so using our usual
numerical-integration-based "correlation-based procedure,"
the result was the following plots.  The other curve plotted is the regret for
range voting using the same H:1-H voter mixture &ndash;
the strategic range voters are using
moving-average strategy and thus are effectively using approval voting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Interesting aside:</b>
The best rank-order system is only a little better than Borda
when N&isin;{4,5}.
</p><p>
As you can see immediately from the plots (and the case N=3 is covered in Part I)
</p>
<p>
<b>CLAIM:</b>
Range voting is superior to every rank-order
voting system (even the best) in the V&rarr;&infin; voter RNEM, for N-candidate 
elections with 3&le;N&le;9, at any voter-honesty fraction H with 0&le;H&le;100%,
provided we ignore the distinction between best and pseudobest.
(That is, more precisely: the regret of range voting is less than the regret of
the pseudo-best rank-order system at every H, where the "pseudo-best" system
minimizes regret in a model where the strategic voters each have independent uniform-random 
beliefs about "God's likelihood order," <i>but then</i> actual regret is evaluated in a setting
where there is only one, publicly known, such order.)

(by <a href="#thm1">theorem 1</a>)
is the "pseudo-best rank-order voting system."
The best and pseudo-best rank-order systems coincide in the 3-candidate case but
not for more than 3 candidates as here.

<h3>7. Large numbers N of candidates
</h3>

<p>
What about 7, 8, 9,..., candidate elections?
It would be nice to have a theorem proclaiming range voting's superiority versus
the best rank-order 
system for <i>every</i> number N&ge;3 of candidates.
That is a good question.  It is often possible to prove 
&int;A(x)dx&gt;&int;B(x)dx
despite the absence of closed formulas for either integral.
We know what the best rank-order system is for honest voters (see
<a href="#Sec6">Part I's section 6</a>) and we know the
pseudo-best system
for strategic voters (here)
so that we know what "A(x)" and "B(x)" are; the difficulty
is that our integrals are multidimensional.
An interesting task for future authors, then, would
be to develop suitable "comparison theorems" enabling 
such proofs.  
</p><p>
Since I currently lack
such tools, it is useful to consider the limit of 
N&rarr;&infin; candidates.  The idea is
that if we can show something for both
N&le;31 and for N&rarr;&infin;, that makes it plausible that
it works for all N.
</p>
<a name="Thm6"></a>
<p>
<b>THEOREM 6 (Range voting's regret is small for large #candidates):</b>
For honest range voting in the RNEM with V voters, V&rarr;&infin;, 
as the number of candidates N becomes large,
the regret is O(1/lnN)<sup>1/2</sup>
times the regret of "random winner."
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
Use the results about the variances associated with the G<sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
in <a href="#AppA">Part I's appendix A</a> 
to see that all the "normalization factors" for range voters
will be <i>equal</i> up to relative error 
O(1/lnN) (except for an arbitrarily small fraction of voters, which hence will have
an arbitrarily small effect on total utilities).
We can now use, e.g, Chebyshev's bound on probability densities with bounded variance
and more strongly, Hall's work cited in that appendix showing exponential tail bounds; and
also we can use the fact that all voters  are <i>independent</i> and have <i>independent</I> 
utility-versus-range-vote errors, combined with the Chernoff bound, to see that,
with probability&rarr;1, <i>all</i>
the range-vote totals will be the same as the corresponding
true-utility-totals,
up to additive errors whose root mean square has order 
&plusmn;V<sup>1/2</sup>(lnN)<sup>-1/2</sup>.
Meanwhile the <i>maximum</i> among the N true utility totals will almost surely be of order
V<sup>1/2</sup>(lnN)<sup>+1/2</sup>.  
Thus (now again using facts about the  G<sub>k</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
from <a href="#AppA">Part I's appendix A</a>) even 
the maximum <i>among</i> the errors in approximation of utilities by vote totals 
will still be far smaller &ndash; by a factor of order 
(lnN)<sup>1/2</sup> at least &ndash; than the maximum utility,
<b>QED.</b>
</p>
<p>
In contrast,
</p>
<a name="Thm7"></a>
<p>
<b>THEOREM 7 (Other regrets are large for large #candidates):</b>
For each of these weighted positional voting systems:
plurality, antiPlurality, Borda, and median-as-threshold approval voting
(or, indeed, <i>any</i> weighted positional system in which at least a positive
constant fraction of the system-defining weights differ by
at least a positive constant fraction of full scale from the optimum weights
given in <a href="BestVrange.html#Sec6">Part I's section 6</a>)
in the RNEM with V honest voters, V&rarr;&infin;, 
as the number of candidates N becomes large,
the regret tends to a <i>positive constant</i> times
the regret of "random winner."
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
Each vote will, as an approximation to utility, have additive |error|
(on average for each voter)
a constant fraction of full scale.   All these errors are independent,
leading via the central limit theorem
when V&rarr;&infin;
to the vote totals having an expected additive |errors| 
(as an approximation to summed candidate-utilities)
of order V<sup>1/2</sup>, which (note) is the same typical
order as the |utilities| themselves
and all these errors are 
independent in the V&rarr;&infin; limit.
Therefore, if we elect the candidate with maximum vote rather than maximum utility, we 
will lose utility (i.e. experience regret) of the same order as the maximum utility.
<b>QED.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
I conjecture that the 
pseudo-best rank-order system (for V&rarr;&infin; strategic voters under the RNEM)
has the same order regret as strategic approval voting
and random winner, but with a better
constant factor than random winner.  
This would follow immediately if we could prove that at least a positive constant 
fraction of the <u>S</u><sub>J</sub><sup>(N)</sup>
are equal, as empirically appears to be the case, for large N.
</p>
<p>
<b>REMARK:</b>
I conjecture that the best rank-order system (for V&rarr;&infin; honest voters under the RNEM)
has the same order regret as range voting but with a greater
constant factor due to its effective artificial uniformization of 
the intercandidate utility spacings.  
It easily may be shown that Borda, median-as-threshhold Approval, and Plurality 
have successively worse
constant factors in their regrets in the large-N limit.
I also conjecture that strategic approval voting also obeys <a href="#Thm7">theorem 7</a>
and with a strictly better constant factor than random winner.
</p>
<a name="Thm8"></a>
<p>
<b>THEOREM 8 (Strategic and Mean-based "honest" Approval asymptotically same):</b>
Strategic (moving-average strategy) and honest (mean-based threshhold)
have with probability&rarr;1 asymptotically the same regrets
in the RNEM with V honest voters, V&rarr;&infin;, 
as the number of candidates N becomes large.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
The idea is that the moving average is essentially the same as the full average
(both converge to 0 under the RNEM) for almost all of the N candidates, when N&rarr;&infin;.
Hence the approximations of utility-totals by vote-totals
will have asymptotically the same distributions for both voting methods.
<b>QED.</b>
</p>
<a name="Thm9"></a>
<p>
<b>THEOREM 9 (Strategic Plurality for large #candidates):</b>
For strategic plurality voting,
in the RNEM with V honest voters, V&rarr;&infin;, 
as the number of candidates N becomes large,
the regret is <i>asymptotic</i> to the regret of random winner.
(This is also true for the "random ballot" election method.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
Consequence of our exact regret formulas and
<a href="BestVrange.html#AppA">Part I's appendix A</a> &ndash;
in its notation the expected regret of 
strategic plurality is <nobr>G<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup>-G<sub>1</sub><sup>(2)</sup></nobr>
which when N&rarr;&infin; is asymptotic to the
expected regret
G<sub>1</sub><sup>(N)</sup>-0
of random winner or random ballot.
<b>QED.</b>
</p>
</p><p>
Another question is: "what about other statistical/political
models besides RNEM (such as D-dimensional
politics models, etc)?"  Can future authors prove analogous results to ours
in those models?  With the help of some fortuitous miracles we <i>are</i>
able to accomplish that in some cases. 
That will be explained in a new paper "<a href="BestVot2.html">part III</a>."
