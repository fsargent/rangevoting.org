<b>Notation:</b>
If a and b are events,
let "a&supe;b" mean "in the view of any fixed individual: a is preferable to b,
or that individual does not care which of a or b happen."
We write a&sim;b ("the individual is indifferent about whether a or b happens")
to mean "a&supe;b and b&supe;a."
We write a&sup;b to mean "a&supe;b and not a&sim;b."
Let "p<b>?</b>A:B" mean
"a lottery causing A to happen with probability p and B with probability 1-p."
Then here are some interesting possible axioms which &supe; could satisfy.
<dl>
<dt><b>Totality Axiom:</b></dt>
<dd>
For all events a,b either a&supe;b, or b&supe;a, or both, i.e. a&sim;b.
</dd>

<dt><b>Continuity Axiom:</b></dt>
<dd>
<!-- Archimedean:
For all a,b,c: if  b&supe;c,  there exists some p>0 such that  (p?a:b)&supe;c. -->
If A&sup;B and B&sup;C then B &sim; p?A:C for at least one p with 0&lt;p&lt;1.
</dd>

<dt><b>Dominance (via convexity) Axiom:</b></dt>
<dd>
For all p with 0&lt;p&lt;1:
<ul>
<li>
If A&supe;B and A&sup;C, then A &supe; p?B:C.
</li><li>
If B&supe;A and C&sup;A, then p?B:C &supe; A.
</li><li>
If A&sim;B and A&sim;C then A &sim; p?B:C.
</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>Transitivity Axiom:</b></dt>
<dd>
<!-- If a&supe;b and b&supe;c then a&supe;c.  
But this can be replaced with the weaker: -->
If a&sim;b and b&sim;c then a&sim;c.
</dd>

<dt><b>Herstein-Milnor Lottery Axiom:</b></dt>
<dd>
<!--  this version is stronger than Herstein-Milnor:
For any events a,b,c:
a&supe;b if and only if
for any p with 0&le;p&le;1,
(p?a:c)&supe;(p?b:c). -->
If A&sim;B then 
&frac12;?A:C &sim;&frac12;?B:C.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Here are some theorems.
</p>
<p><b>Existence Theorem for monotonic utility function (P.C.Fishburn 1983):</b>
Totality, Continuity, Dominance, and Transitivity imply that there exists
a real-valued function u() so A&supe;B &hArr; u(A)&ge;u(B),
where u( p?A:B ) is a continuous increasing function of p when 0&le;p&le;1 if A&sup;B
(and is constant in p if A&sim;B).
</p>
<p><b>Existence Theorem for linear utilities (J.von Neumann &amp; O.Morgenstern 1947):</b>
Totality, Continuity, Dominance, and Herstein-Milnor imply that
there exists a "utility function"  u  which assigns to each lottery  L
a real number  u(L)  with the following three properties:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Strict monotonicity (MonT):</b><dt>
<dd>
     u(a) &ge; u(b)  if and only if  a&supe;b.
</dd>
<dt><b>Lottery utilities are expected utilities (Lin):</b></dt>
<dd>
     u(p?a:b) = p&middot;u(a) + (1-p)&middot;u(b).
</dd>
<dt><b>Uniqueness up to transformations of scale (AffUniq):</b></dt>
<dd>
    For any two functions u, v  that both satisfy the preceding two properties,
    there are real numbers  r,s  such that  v = r + s&middot;u.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
These are essentially the properties economists usually take for
granted when speaking about individual "utility." 
</p>
<p>
This second theorem is a standard starting point.
What do we think of it?  Some (not I, but apparently some) would dispute the
Continuity axiom.  E.g. to paraphrase a dispute on the subject:
<blockquote>
<b>Anti-Continuist:</b> Any probability p>0 that my child dies (no matter
how small p is),
is worse than me losing 1 penny of money.  Therefore the
Continuity axiom is false.
<br>
<b>Continuist:</b> I know you are lying, because I know
you bent down to pick up a penny
and therefore stopped watching your child for 30 milliseconds.  
Also, you are not
presently tossing pennies over your child's head to protect her against incoming
meteorites.
</blockquote>
<p>
<small>If (essentially) we discard the continuity
axiom, then it still is possible to prove analogues of the Theorem but which 
involve utility values in Nelson's "non-standard" reals (the field extension that arises by including an
"infinitesimal" quantity  &epsilon;).</small>
</p><p>
Some (not I, but perhaps some) also might dispute the Totality axiom.
</p>
<p>
The axiom that people seem to be the most willing to discard is the
Lottery Axiom since, e.g, they regard uncertainty as
somehow bad.  Fishburn in 1983 brilliantly considered the consequences of that and
proved the following therem:
</p>
<p><b>Theorem of nonlinear utilities (Fishburn 1983):</b>
Totality, Continuity, Dominance, 
and the "Symmetry Axiom" below &hArr; there exists a skew-symmetric
bilinear functional SSBF on 2-tuples of lotteries such that  A&supe;B &hArr; SSBF(A,B)&ge;0
and that SSBF() is unique up to "similarity transformation."
[Skew-symmetry means SSBF(A,B) = -SSBF(B,A) and bilinearity means
SSBF(p?A:B, C) = p&middot;SSBF(A,C) + (1-p)&middot;SSBF(B,C)
and 
SSBF(C, p?A:B) = p&middot;SSBF(C,A) + (1-p)&middot;SSBF(C,B).]
</p>

<p>
<b>Fishburn's Symmetry Axiom:</b><br>
If A&supe;B, B&supe;C, A&supe;C, and B &sim; &frac12;?A:C, then
p?A:C &sim; &frac12;?A:B &hArr; p?C:A &sim; &frac12;?C:B.
</p>

<p>
You are warned that these skew-symmetric bilinear nonlinear utility functionals
can be rather strange and hard to use.  
(They allow intransitive
preference "cycles" and generally disobey the Herstein-Milnor axiom.
Quick sanity check: have you, personally, ever felt that A was better 
than B was better than C which in turn was better than A for three options A,B,C?)
Almost nobody besides Fishburn ever has used it.
Also, anybody disputing the Herstein-Milnor Lottery axiom
would quite plausibly dispute Fishburn's symmetry axiom too.
Finally, it is important to keep in mind that
Fishburn's utilities are the <i>same thing</i> as ordinary utilities if we are
talking about deterministic events.

<h2> Harsanyi's argument "Social Utility" is the average of individual utilities </h2>

<p>
Let u<sub>k</sub>(e) denote the utility (according to individual k) of
an event e.
We want to investigate how to aggregate the individual utilities into
a "social utility" saying "how good e is for all of society."
For what reason should we claim that social utility
is just the <i>average</i> of individual utilities?
</p>
<p>
J.C.Harsanyi, in a 2-page article involving no mathematics whatever
[J.Political Economy 61,5 (1953) 434-435],
came up with the following nice idea:
"Optimizing social welfare" means 
"picking the state of the world all individuals
would prefer if they were in a state of uncertainty about their
identity." 
I.e. if you are equally likely to be anybody, then your
expected utility is the summed utility in the world divided by the
number of people in it &ndash; i.e. average utility.
Then by the linear-lottery property (Lin) of
von Neumann utility, it follows that social utility is averaging.
</p>
<p>
Actually, Harsanyi nowhere connected to von Neumann's axiomatic development, but
he should have because it connects beautifully.
Indeed, Harsanyi's paper can justifiably
be criticized as the work of a mathematical idiot, because
he also neglected to note the key point that 
<i>von Neumann utility is only unique up to, and only defined up to, scaling</i>.
The whole idea of averaging individual von Neumann utilities, then, can <i>only</i>
even be talked about at all if all individuals somehow have uniquified their utility
functions by adopting a common scale.  
</p>
<p>
One way to do that would be to <i>assume</i> the existence of two magical special events,
which everybody can be assumed to view as having the same utility-difference,
e.g.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The world is destroyed by a sudden giant explosion,
</li><li>
Everybody is magically transplanted into identical bodies in identical pleasant
situations on a new planet that magically appears.
</li></ol>

<small>
<p>
And for a yet another
approach to proving utility is additive starting from a set of axioms, see
[Uzi Segal: Let's agree all dictators are equally bad,
Journal of the Political Economy 108,3 (June 2000) 569-589].
Segal basically uses the approach we just outlined, except for a sleight of hand where
he uses his "dictator indifference" axiom to play the role of our "two magical events" to
set up a common scale.  Anyhow, I for one do not agree that
"all dictators are equally bad"; it appears to me that some have been good.
</p>

<h2> Social utility = averaging via new approaches not depending on lotteries </h2>
<p>
Some would dispute the axioms underlying all that.
For example, some might dispute the Lottery axiom:
<blockquote>
<b>Objector:</b>
A lottery awarding a million dollars to A with probability 1/2 and to B with
probability 1/2, is <i>better</i> than just giving A the money or just giving B
the money because it is more "fair" and I also value fairness.
</blockquote>
Or in the other direction, many investors argue
the lottery is <i>worse</i> than the deterministic award
because we are "risk averse" and regard uncertainty itself as a bad thing.
</p><p>
If Herstein-Milnor Lottery axiom is discarded,  
linearity (Lin) fails whereupon many social utility
aggregation methods become permitted besides just averaging.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there are also other axiom sets (by Warren D. Smith)
which also yield the "averaging=social aggregation" (or one can say "summing" in place
of "averaging" since the two yield equivalent preferences) correspondence
but via reasoning that <i>never involves probabilities</i> and lotteries:
See puzzles 36 and 37 <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p36">here</a>.
</p>
</p><p>
But these still do not really settle the matter because
there also is room for people to dispute some of <i>those</i> axioms,
as is discussed in puzzle 38.
The question of which axioms about "social goodness" to accept,
is probably not something that can be settled by mathematics.
Still, I think every reasonable person would agree that
all these axioms are <i>usually</i> at least <i>approximately</i> true.
