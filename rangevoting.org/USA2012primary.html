<h2> USA 2012 presidential election viewed through prism of voting method reform </h2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, April 2013 
(also with some contributions from Jameson Quinn)</small></p>
<h3> Plan </h3>

<p>
We shall review the 2012 USA presidential election contrasting what happened with the 
official <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-based 
voting system, with what would have happened using 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> or
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting.
To do this we take advantage of the fact that about 100 nationwide polls
were conducted using these alternative systems.
</p><p>
The General election and Democratic party primary would still have come out the same.
The Republican party primary would have changed substantially and probably for the better
if changed to use score or approval voting and merged into the whole general election
(so that the whole populace voted on all these candidates);
a substantially different set of candidates would have performed well;
there would have been less  "wild variability" and "randomness"; and there would
have been a better chance that a Republican could defeat Obama (i.e. the Republican party
itself would have been better off switching voting systems).  Approval voting
<a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">tends</a> to have a "pro-centrist bias," versus 
plurality's and IRV's pro-extremist 
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">biases</a>, and that might also have happened in this election
provided we regard Cain, Bachmann, Perry, Santorum as more "extreme" and "strange" as
opposed to regarding Huntsman &amp; Pawlenty as more "centrist."
</p><p>
Also, as usual, the official system <i>tremendously</i> distorted the level of support
for third-party candidates, making it appear they had almost none whereas in fact it
was substantial.
</p>


<h3> The General Election </h3>
<p>
The general
election, since essentially a 2-man race between Obama &amp; Romney, was boring
from the standpoint of voting method theory.

In the rightmost score-voting table, the "means" were calculated via

mean for Obama = (38&times;2+16&times;1-11&times;1-34&times;2)/(38+16+11+34) = 0.1313

</center>
<p>
If however we instead calculated them via
</p><center>
mean for Obama = (38Y+16X-11X-34Y)/(38+16+11+34) = (4Y+5X)/99
<br>
mean for Romney = (30Y+23X-14X-31Y)/(30+23+14+31) = (9X-Y)/98
</center>
<p>
for <i>any</i> scores X,Y with 0&le;X&lt;Y (not necessarily Y=2 and X=1,
for example Jameson Quinn prefers X=1, Y=3 yielding equispaced scores), 
then we'd <i>still always</i> conclude "Obama defeats Romney" so this conclusion is robust.

<p>
The only development of much interest was statistician Nate <b>Silver</b>
(whose "FiveThirtyEight"
forecasts and models are often published in the <i>New York Times</i>)
successfully predicting not only Obama's 2012 victory, but indeed Silver's model
correctly called all 50 US states  plus the district of Columbia.
</p><p>
We therefore focus on the <b>primary</b> elections.
</p>
<h3> The Primaries </h3>
<p>
The Democratic Party primary was even less interesting: 
President Obama easily won their (re)nomination
with almost no opposition, winning every state by a massive margin. 
</p><p>
The <b>Republican</b> Party primary, however, was a prolonged and massive 
joke.  Or perhaps better phrases are "national embarrassment" and
"slow moving political  train wreck."
The Republicans (and entire country)
would certainly not have been worse off, and might have been far better off,
if they had used <a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>
for their primary.
</p>
<a name="RCPgraphic"></a>,
<img src="GOPprimary2012.png" alt="Plurality tracking polls: RCP average 2012"/>
<p>
Why?  With plurality voting, what tends to happen is that two candidates, via luck, or
past history, or a big dose of advertising money, appear temporarily to be
"the two most likely to win."  Then they <b>shoot up</b> hugely in the polls since nobody
wants to "waste their vote" on anybody who is not a contender.  This in turn
causes them to get money donations (nobody wants to donate to non-contenders)
causing them to appear more convincingly to be "one of the top two" etc.
So largely by random chance, two candidates get selected and for the rest of
Time, the race is just between those two.  That's unfortunately what usually happens
and it is ridiculous &ndash; the Republican Party and USA both deserve better than
"most wanted among two randoms."
</p><p>
However, in this race, that did not happen.  It kept <i>trying</i> to happen, though.   A random,
often incredibly asinine, candidate would appear, somehow create the impression he/she was one of 
the Top Two, then shoot up in polls and votes.  
As you can see from Real Clear Politics' graphical attempt to track and average 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style polls
of the GOP contenders throughout the Republican primary, first Bachmann shot up to 
top in the polls (actually RCP seems to have missed the 15-17 July nationwide 
<a href="PPP_Release_National_0719.pdf">poll</a>
showing that, which we've added); then fell to low numbers (she eventually dropped out).  
Then Perry shot up to top, then fell, even more dramatically.
Then Cain.  Then Gingrich.  Finally Santorum.
Eventually, Romney, who'd managed to stay "one of the top two" <i>throughout</i>,
emerged on top simply by dint of staying power even though widely disliked;
and note he too then experienced a great rise in the polls at the end.
(Romney's only previous elected office was as 1-term Massachusetts governor;
he did not run again since it seemed clear that 
if he tried he could not be re-elected.  Romney mainly distinguished himself in this race by
probably the greatest number of major "flip flops" ever seen from a major US
presidential contender.)
At that point,
one might have expected Huntsman (or Paul?) to shoot to the top just to continue the 
roller-coaster pattern,
but by that time Romney had accumulated so many votes that it was fairly clear that 
Huntsman could not credibly claim to be "likely to win" (nor even "second most likely to win")
even if he too could hitch a Random Rocket Ride. 
Therefore, voters and donors abandoned him and that did not happen.
</p><p>
All those sudden amazing rises
were not at all logical in the sense that the rocketing candidate suddenly 
got to be a lot better in any objective sense.  No: it always 
was a fad, caused by the strategic imperatives of the stupid
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> Voting System.  
[Perhaps the fact that in this race, for the first time
in a long time, unlimited money by corporations and rich donors was allowed,
was one reason things were so volatile.]
After said incredo-rise, the candidate would usually fall flat on his (or her) face by 
revealing his/her massive asininity in the most public and clear possible manner, causing
him/her no longer to be reckoned "top two most likely to win" producing
an equally dramatic fall.  This kept happening.  
Romney's eventual final rise also was not caused by any great improvement in perceptions
of him independent of the GOP race: 
his favorable:unfavorable rating started out in late 2010 
and early 2011
as 36:29 and 40:30,
in January 2012 was 39:37,
dipped to a low of 37:47 in early April,
in late June 2012 had recovered to 43:43,
and by the time of the Nov. 2012 election it was 49:45.
The net change actually was a <i>drop</i>!
</p><p>
You have to realize than many of the candidates <i>were</i> ludicrous.
For example Cain had never held <i>any</i> elected office and made a living as a 
"motivational speaker" talking about how he had in earlier days
been appointed head of the
"Godfather pizza" restaurant chain (after still earlier managerial 
experience in "Burger King") which I guess was supposed to inspire other people
to also become pizza chain managers.
Perry famously 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvmKnFY4uk">announced</a>
during a nationally televised debate that he was going to trump 
all his wimp rivals at budget cutting,
by totally eliminating 3-5 departments of the Federal government.
But then, a minute later, he could not remember how many and which ones!
Bachmann earned the sobriquet &quot;<a href="BachmannIsNuts.html">batshit crazy</a>&quot;
for her continual propensity to utter the most absurd notions of what was going on in the world.
Gingrich was the former speaker of the USA house, who'd <i>resigned</i>
as the result of an ethics scandal (not exactly a strong qualification)
and he'd played a leading role in the failed impeachment of President W.J.Clinton
over his philandering (oh sorry, Gingrich's stance was it was because Clinton lied about doing 
it, not because he did it),
which also was unlikely to impress the bulk of the public, especially since Gingrich himself 
had such a long history of repeated embarrassing marital failures/imbroglios that it
actually made Clinton look good by comparison.
</p><p>
Eventually after many such amazing rises and falls
of candidates revealed as embarrassments... Romney, who had lots of money and 
managed mostly to avoid the highest levels of stupidity, won even though widely disliked.
</p><p>
The net result was that the Republicans nominated a contender (Romney) unable to beat Obama.
But Jon <b>Huntsman</b>, as former Utah Governor (two terms, won re-election with over 78% of
the vote and had very high approval ratings among Utahans, e.g. over 80% at end of second term
and sometimes 90% during terms)
Ambassador to China, and wealthy businessman, on paper
seemed the most qualified.
Utah was named the "best managed state" by the Pew Center on the States during his terms.
And Nate Silver's model 
suggested Huntsman was the <i>most electable</i> versus Obama (indeed 
some models predicted he was the <i>only</i> Republican 
able to defeat Obama), see graphic below.  However... Huntsman got nowhere!
</p>
<img src="SilverHuntsmanModel.png" alt="Silver model predicts Huntsman the most electable"/>
<center>
From "Choose Obama's Re-Election Adventure," <i>New York Times</i> 3 Nov. 2011.
Silver's "Obama versus X" model 
<br>
regards Gingrich and Santorum as nearly equivalent to Perry,
but makes no forecast about Ron Paul.
</center>
<p>
Similar remarks could be made about 
(two term MN Governor, approval:disapproval ratings of 46:40, 49:49, 42:52 among
Minnesotans during and after terms) 
Tim <a href="Pawlenty11.html">Pawlenty</a>, also a highly qualified and perhaps
comparatively electable Republican.
Pawlenty <b>dropped out</b> of the US presidential
race in August 2011 &ndash; I repeat, <i>August</i>, before even a single vote had been cast
&ndash; an 
apparent victim of plurality voting pathologies (he did not believe he could "catch a
rocket ride" because he'd used up his early pool of money without succeeding in 
creating the impression
he was one of The Top Two Most Likely To Win, thus judged himself unlikely to be 
able to attract a huge
pool of further money, etc).
</p><p>
That was just <b>absurd</b>.  Why should the most qualified and electable candidates 
feel/be unable to run just because they couldn't reach top-two 
poll status  <i>before the game even began?</i>
</p><p>
This early nationwide 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a>
poll by Quinnipiac University (21-28 Feb 2011; note it also includes many
&ndash; here <i>italicized</i> &ndash; "contenders" who
actually made no attempt to run for 2012 president; they unfortunately omitted Perry
but based on data we shall present later Perry would have done poorly with score voting)
indicated that actually Pawlenty and Huntsman both initially enjoyed
<i>better</i> mean assessments than <i>every</i> Romney-rival
(Bachmann, Santorum, Gingrich, Paul) all of whom, mainly due to the 
"random rocket ride" phenomenon, far out-primaried them both:
</p><hr><pre>

This suggests the Republican party would have been better off, providing 
the USA with a better debate, among more-impressive and logical candidates, 
yielding them a greater chance of winning, if they had instead employed <b>score voting.</b>

Other score voting style polls using allowed-score-set {+2, +1, -1, -2}

Unfortunately for our purposes, these pollsters included

<blockquote>
<b>Ninety {+2, +1, -1, -2} nationwide score voting polls.</b>
Each poll sampled usually slightly more than 1000 pollees (but occasionally
substantially more) by telephone.
ABC News/Washington Post polls 
and Tarrance/Lake  (also called "Battleground") were very similar
(see at <a href="#ABCWword">top</a> for wording).  
AP &amp; Rasmussen used similar samples and wording  but 
replacing "strongly" with "very"; Reuters/Ipsos &amp; Pew used AP's wording but with
"somewhat" unfavorable
changed to "mostly"  unfavorable.
<b>Asterisks (*):</b> the wording for Pawlenty in this poll explicitly mentioned that he was a
possible <i>vice presidential</i>
pick, whereas all the other polls' wording just gave a name, mentioning no office.
The NBC/WSJ polls used <i>5-point</i> scale 
{very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative, very negative}
where here we've discarded the neutral counts (Obama 13% and Romney 26%).
We unfortunately have no poll data at all of this type for 
Gary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson">Johnson</a>, 
Buddy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Roemer">Roemer</a>, 
Jill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Stein">Stein</a>,
and 
Virgil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Goode">Goode</a>.
(Indeed, yet another embarrassing commentary on US elections is that Ann Romney and Michelle Obama
both were the subject of far more polls and press than these legitimate candidates.)
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Note by Jameson Quinn about 
&quot;<a href="MedianVrange.html#GMJ">Graduated Majority Judgment</a>&quot;
system:</b>
GMJ is similar to average-based range voting except that 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
it is based on 
<a href="MedianVrange.html">median</a>
not average rating, and 
</li><li>
with a certain "tie-breaking scheme" added.
</li></ol>
<p>
Quinn redid the above table computing, in addition,
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>
What would have happened using average-based ratings but based on {+3, +1, -1, -3} 
equipspaced scores (call this "AVG31"; in contrast AVG21 is based on {+2,+1,-1,-2})
</li><li>
What would have happened if GMJ were then used.
</li></ol>
<p>
Regarding each individual poll (mono-colored block) in the above table as an
"election," Quinn found that GMJ and AVG31 completely agreed about
the full ordering of the candidates <i>except</i> for the following differences:
</p><table bgcolor="yellow">
<tr bgcolor="orange"><th>Which poll</th><th>Candidates affected</th>
<th>AVG21 order</th>
<th>AVG31 order</th><th>GMJ order</th></tr>
<tr><td>Tarrance/Lake Sep 2010</td><td>Pawlenty, Obama</td><td>2,3</td><td>2,3</td><td>3,2</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>AP/GfK Oct 2011</b></td><td>Obama, Cain, Romney</td><td>1,2,3</td><td>3,1,2</td><td>1,2,3</td></tr>
<tr><td>AP/GfK Dec 2011</td><td>Ging, Sant, Bach, Cain, Perr</td><td>4,5,6,7,8</td><td>4,5,6,7,8</td><td>5,4,6,8,7</td></tr>
<tr><td>AP/GfK Feb 2012</td><td>RonPaul, Romney</td><td>2,3</td><td>2,3</td><td>3,2</td></tr>
<tr><td>GWU/Battleground Feb 2012</td><td>RonPaul, Romney</td><td>4,3</td><td>4,3</td><td>3,4<br>(near tie)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The most important among these is obviously the AP/GfK Oct 2011 result. 
With AVG21
the average-based order agrees with GMJ's.
The issue is that with {&plusmn;3, &plusmn;1} score, Obama gets
pulled down by his higher negatives, whereas with GMJ his net positive is all that matters. 
Quinn argues that GMJ is doing it right in this case.
Smith would, however, argue that which is doing it "right" would depend on whether we really
agree the correct numerical scores ought to be {&plusmn;3, &plusmn;1}
(the voters were not given numerical scores, they were merely given verbal
descriptions such as "very favorable" and "somewhat unfavorable")
and also on whether we believe those voters were being "honest" or "strategic."
Pretending for the purposes of argument the voters <i>had</i> known the scores were
{+3,+1,-1,-3}, then if those high-negatives for Obama were honest &ndash;
i.e. the voters really did have bimodal opinions about him while having unimodal
(single peaked) opinions about Romney &amp; Cain &ndash;
then Obama <i>should</i> come in
last among these 3 candidates (agreeing AVG31),  but if those high negatives instead
were due to those voters
1-sidely strategically <i>exaggerating</i>
in an effort to hurt Obama, then he should come in first (agreeing GMJ).
This demonstrates how 
GMJ tends to correct for strategic "1-sided exaggeration" by voters better than 
average-based range voting.
<small>[End of GMJ note.]</small>
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
<b>Conclusions:</b>
Obama would have defeated all rivals 
with {+2,+1,-1,-2} score voting.  But the second-place finisher is not clear:
it might have been <b>Pawlenty, Paul, Romney, or Santorum.</b>
(The statistical and temporal fluctuations are great enough that we cannot decide who,
but the <i>earlier</i>-listed candidates perhaps seem a bit more likely than the later-listed.)

This all is <i>restricted</i> to the candidates polled this way;
we <i>do not know</i> how Johnson, Roemer, Stein, and Goode would have performed
since we have no data for them.
Note that Ron Paul got greater mean ratings than Mitt Romney on 2 (later) occasions and less on
4 (earlier) occasions.  [And Paul also outscored Romney in a {+2,+1,-1,-2}-score-style
poll conducted online by Public Religion Research Institute 7-20 March 2012
among adults age 18-24 (not shown).]  So one could claim it would have been Paul.
Remember, the date that matters is 6 Nov. 2012, and <i>more recent</i> polls
within our table have more relevance to that date.
Santorum similarly outscored Romney in later (but not earlier) polls of this kind,
but Paul in turn usually outscored Santorum.
Also, Pawlenty outscored Romney in the two later out of the three such polls
we are aware of that included him (but this matter is
confused by the asterisk, and Pawlenty had a much greater fraction of voters who
said they "did not know enough" to score him).

<h3> Approval Voting </h3>

<img src="AppPrimaryGOP2012.png" alt="Approval versus time"/>

<p>
This graph shows "how approved" each candidate was at different times.
The vertical axis is 1000F/(F+U) where F and U are
the fraction of the population rating him "favorable" and "unfavorable"
in some poll at that time.    (Multipoll average used if more than one at same time.)
The horizontal axis is (a somewhat distorted version of) time.
(The <a href="USA2012Approval.txt">underlying dataset</a>.)
There is a lot of "noise," some of it due to genuine changes in public opinion,
but a goodly fraction is genuine statistical noise in those polls
(which you can mentally remove by "smoothing" the curves).
Most of the polls plotted sampled 1000 people, and if (say) half provided an
opinion of that particular candidate 
while the other half refused, then that datapoint since based on only 500
respondents would have standard error &plusmn;32.
[And that's pretty large: &plusmn;32 is a 64-wide interval which is 21% of the
300-wide range graphed, and two standard deviations worth of noise would be 43% of
fill graphed range, and then there is additional noise due to slight
methodological differences between different pollsters.
Also note Obama as the most-well-known candidate seemed to have the least noise,
as expected.]
</p><p>
It also is interesting that {Paul, Pawlenty, Huntsman}
all did better reckoned by approval fraction than
any of {Bachmann, Perry, Gingrich, Cain},
but almost exactly the opposite happened with the official method,
plurality voting.  
</P>

<h3> On Wild Variability </h3>

<p>
As we <a href="#RCPgraphic">saw</a>, the plurality-style poll numbers fluctuated wildly
often changing by a <i>factor</i> <b>exceeding 5</b> for a <i>single</i> candidate.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Example:</b>
Perry had about 5% in mid-June 2011, 
rose to 30% in mid-September, then dropped back  to about 6% in mid-January 2012.
</blockquote><p>
Also, some candidates had over 500 times fewer votes than others.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the {+2,+1,-1,-2} <b>score</b>-voting
means did not fluctuate nearly as much.  The lowest-ever
poll number for anybody was -0.78 and the greatest ever +0.33
on a -2 to +2 scale, which if we translated the scale to "0 to 4" to allow
easy comparison with plurality polls, would be a 1.22 to 2.33 subrange, which is
variability factor&le;<b>1.9</b>, among <i>all</i> candidates and <i>all</i> times polled.
I.e, with score voting
the most popular candidate at peak had 1.9 times the support of the least-popular one 
(among those polled) at min.
</p><p>
That immediately tells you that score voting provides more realistic and 
less-crazily-varying "random" results than plurality voting.
Plurality voting would have yielded 6 different Republican winners, 
</p><center>
<u>Bachmann</u>, Cain, <u>Gingrich</u>, <u>Perry</u>, Romney, Santorum.
</center><p>
depending on the date,
out of the 8 
<a href="#RCPgraphic">graphed</a> candidates.
Among the same 8 candidates, {+2,+1,-1,-2} score voting would
have yielded only 4 winners (depending on date)
</p><center>
Cain, <u>Paul</u>, Romney, Santorum,
</center><p>
(which note are <i>not</i> a subset of the 6 &ndash; the <u>underlined</u> candidates
are the set-difference)
with Pawlenty becoming an additional 5th winner if included as a 9th candidate.
</p><p>
The greatest-ever <b>approval-fraction</b>
in our graph was 617 (Paul in August 2012; second-greatest was 602 for
Obama in March 2011) and the least-ever was 286 (Perry in late October 2011; second-least 
was Gingrich's 303 in early Feb. 2012).  This is a total range of variation of
a factor 617/286=<b>2.13</b>.  
The greatest variation seen for any <i>single</i> candidate was Perry
who fell from 478 in late Aug. 2011 to 286, a factor 417/286=<b>1.67</b>.
These again are far smaller than the variations under plurality-style voting.

<h3> Miscellaneous about Ron Paul &ndash; I. "most approved" on 8 August </h3>

<p>
<small>
A substantial fraction of this section is quoted almost verbatim from 
<a href="http://ingotnews.com/post/29079364317/new-presidential-poll-barack-obama-and-ron-paul-in-a">IngotNews.com</a>.  
We warn the reader that the Pulse poll seems atypically pro-Paul; 
e.g. other pollsters at other dates found
lower "favorable" percentages for Paul.  Indeed, this poll represented the highest-ever approval
fraction known to me, for any candidate during the whole campaign.
</small><p>
In a poll conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, released 8 August 2012, 
which matched up presidential candidates Barack Obama and Ron Paul, 
one thousand likely voters said that they have near-equal preference when given a 
choice between Obama and Ron Paul.
Here are the results from the poll, when a randomly selected group (via phone) 
were asked the following question &quot;Suppose in this year's
Presidential Election you had a choice between Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Barack Obama. 
If the election were held today would you vote for Republican Ron Paul or Democrat 
Barack Obama?&quot;
</p><center>
 45% Ron Paul;  47% Barack Obama;  6% Some other candidate;  2% Not sure
<br>
Margin of sampling error &plusmn;3 percentage points with 95% confidence.
</center>
<p>
Meanwhile in an independent nationwide poll by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. held 5-7 August
(sampled 1008 by phone) asked "If Barack Obama were the Democratic Party's candidate and
Mitt Romney were the Republican Party's candidate, who would you be
more likely to vote for &ndash; Obama, the Democrat, or Romney, the
Republican?"  The results were:
</p><center>
 47% Mitt Romney;  49% Barack Obama;  4% Neither/Other;  &lt;0.5% No opinion
</center>
<p>
<a name="PaulGoodFav"></a>
Also interesting were the favorability ratings found by the Pulse poll:
</p><center>
58% of those surveyed have a favorable view of Ron Paul, while just 36% have an unfavorable view. 
<br>
Compare this to Mitt Romney (50% favorable, 45% unfavorable) and 
<br>
Barack Obama (51% favorable, 48% unfavorable).
</center>
<p>
Evidently, at least at that time,
Paul rose above Romney &amp; Obama and presumably to the top in terms of
<a href="Approval.html"><b>approval</b></a> voting.
This contrasts with the fact Paul never got past third place 
(he may not have even reached third)
using 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>  voting, which seems a massive
distortion of democracy.
</p>

<h3> Miscellaneous about Ron Paul &ndash; II. Vote splitting </h3>
<p>
The Pew Research Center in an 11-16 January 2012 poll (1207 registered voters sampled)
asked
voters whom they'd vote for in a 2012 election between Obama &amp; Romney,
and also under the supposition Ron Paul would run as a third-party candidate.
</p>
<table cellpadding="15" align="center">
<tr><td>
<table bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><td>Obama</td><td>Romney</td><td>Other/don't know</td></tr>
<tr><td>50</td><td>45</td><td>6%</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td>
<table bgcolor="pink">
<tr><td>Obama</td><td>Romney</td><td>RonPaul</td><td>Other/don't know</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td>32</td><td>18</td><td>6%</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Evidently, Paul thus-running would have assured a (clearer) Obama victory, because Paul would
have extracted over twice as many votes from Romney as Obama.
(As it was, Paul did not run.)
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> voting
does not suffer from this unhealthy "vote splitting" phenomenon.
Thus with the (unfortunately used) 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> system, Paul was discouraged from running;
but with approval, at least if he believed in his
<a href="#PaulGoodFav">above</a> record high favorable:unfavorable rating,
Paul would have been very <i>en</i>couraged to run.
