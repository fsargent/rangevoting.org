<H2> Yee Pictures illustrating voting method behavior </H2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, January 2007</small></p>
<p>
Ka-Ping Yee in 2006 introduced a wonderful
way to examine single-winner election methods
via computer graphics.  
Versions 2.0 and above of my program <a href="IEVS.c">IEVS</a>
(<i>I</i>nfinitely <i>E</i>xtendible <i>V</i>oting <i>S</i>imulator;
see <a href="assets/documents/IEVSinputs.txt">example input</a>)
support generation of Yee-type pictures and the pictures in this directory were produced
by using IEVS.
</p>
<p>
To explain how Yee pictures work: imagine the N "candidates" are N fixed
points in the Euclidean plane.
The voters also are points in that plane, but imagine they are random points
sampled from a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution with prescribed variance and 
prescribed centerpoint (peak location) <i>(x,y)</i>.
Imagine these voters conduct an election to choose a winner.
Voters prefer candidates that are nearer to them ("utility is a decreasing function 
of voter-candidate distance").
We then <i>color</i> the pixel at <i>(x,y)</i> with the color of the winner
(selected from a fixed N-color palette).  Do this for every 
<i>(x,y)</i> and the result is a multicolored picture.
You get different pictures depending on the candidate-coordinates, the
voting method used, and the variance of the Gaussian.
</p>

<H2> Some simple symmetrical point sets </H2>
<H3> First example: 3 candidates at the vertices of an equilateral triangle </H3>

<p>
All election methods ever seriously proposed  return the same Yee-picture (at left;
the candidate-locations are indicated by the little circles)
</p>
<img src="assets/images/vorEqTri.bmp" alt="vorEqTri.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/worstEqTri.bmp" alt="worstEqTri.bmp">
<p>
All those methods perform "optimally," i.e. elect the best winner for society always
in this scenario.  If they instead were to elect the <b>worst</b> winner,
we'd instead get the picture at right.
</p>

<H3> Second example: 4 candidates at the vertices of a square (the corners of the image) </H3>

<p>
<i>Almost</i> all election methods ever seriously proposed  return the same Yee-picture
(at left):
</p>
<img src="assets/images/vorSquare.bmp" alt="vorSquare.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/irvSquare.bmp" alt="irvSquare.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/irvPent5.bmp" alt="irvPent5.bmp">
<p>
which again represents optimal performance.
But not all: the <b>IRV</b> (instant runoff) method returns a rather different (and crazy)
picture (using for the voter-Gaussian's &sigma;=196 in each axis direction; the picture
is 200x200), at middle.
If we go to pentagonal rather than square symmetry (rightmost picture), 
then <b>IRV</b> behaves better  &ndash; it always elects the optimal winner in
the large #voters limit &ndash; but in some ways it behaves even more peculiarly:
here there is a <i>pentagonal ring</i> of "tough to call" elections in which IRV
(due to voter randomness) occasionally returns a suboptimal winner.  The <i>truly</i>
tough-call elections are near the center of the pentagon,
but that is not the way IRV perceives it.
</p>

<H2> A set of 14 random points </H2>

<p>
The points are:
(120,126), (64,158), (102,114), (35,164), (66,161), (146,164), (153,59), (115,101), 
(136,112), (95,59), (117,37), (164,80), (31,153), (170,82).
The picture window is [0,199]x[0,199] with the origin in the lower left corner.
In all the pictures in this section the utility function is
1/&radic;(12000+Distance&sup2;) and the Gaussian has &sigma;=70 in each axis direction.
</p>
<p>
In the limit of a large number of voters, all of the following voting methods
<ol>
<li>
The hypothetical <b>optimum</b> method (best societal utility winner), 
</li><li>
all "<b>Condorcet</b> methods" with honest voters
<blockquote>
The theorem that with honest voters distributed centrosymmetrically about
any given pixel, and utility a decreasing function of voter-candidate distance,
a Condorcet winner always exists and is the closest candidate to that pixel,
apparently was first proved by
[Otto A. Davis, Morris H. DeGroot, Melvin J. Hinich:
Social Preference Orderings and Majority Rule,
Econometrica 40,1 (Jan 1972) 147-157,
see thms 1 and 4 and corollary 2].
It also was mentioned by
[Richard D. McKelvey:
Intransitivities in multidimensional voting methods and
some implications for agenda control,
J.Economic Theory 12 (1976) 472-482.]
</blockquote>
</li><li>
<b>Approval</b> voting with "oblivious random threshold" (that is, each voter approves
candidates closer to them than R, where each voter independently chooses R
at random according
to some fixed everywhere-positive probability density on the positive reals),
</li><li>
<b>Approval</b> voting with the following kind of strategic voter:
(a) hold approval election, (b) hold another this time with voters approving
candidates above a utility threshold, disapproving those below, and toss a fair coin to
decide whether to approve anybody whose utility is
exactly equal to the threshhold &ndash; where each voter uses the utility of
the previous round's winner as her threshold, (c) keep re-doing approval elections
as in (b) until a steady state (same winner every time) is reached (which we can prove
will happen with probability&rarr;1)
</li><li>
<b>Arrow-Raynaud</b> voting with honest voters.
</li></ol>
all provably always yield the same Yee picture,
namely the "<b>Voronoi diagram</b>" (at left):
</p>
<img src="assets/images/voronoi666.bmp" alt="voronoi666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/bramssanver666.bmp" alt="bramssanver666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/approval666.bmp" alt="approval666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/approval666Z2.bmp" alt="approval666Z2.bmp">
<p>
The <b>Brams-Sanver "preference approval voting"</b> method (pictured middle above)
empirically also exhibits optimal performance 
in this case (honest voters using mean candidate utility as approval threshhold).
However one occasionally encounters 2D scenarios in which the
Brams-Sanver picture and the Voronoi diagram do not completely coincide.
[Example: Take &sigma;=100 and three candidates at
(60,60), (140,140), (60,160)
or the last point can be replaced by (120,60); in both cases the picture
will disagree slightly with the Voronoi diagram near (100,100).]
And <b>approval voting</b> also does not coincide with the Voronoi diagram <i>if</i>
voters use the strategy of approving candidates above mean utility and
disapproving those below (2nd from right picture above); this method appears to give
centrist candidates a big advantage and in this case obliterated 7 of the candidates
(including 6 of 8 non-central "outsiders") down to zero win-region.
(A 2X-zoomed out version of the same picture is at the far right.)
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, <b>IRV</b> (honest voters, lefthand picture below)
exhibits crazy behavior in which about half the candidates can never win,
many others do not lie within their own win-regions, the win regions can exhibit crazy shapes
(including severely-nonconvex, disconnected, and non-simply connected...), and
there are a lot of "close call" (random dot) regions representing 
election "near-tie nightmares."  
Incidentally, IRV supporters have told me they believed it was <i>rare</i> for
IRV to fail to elect a Condorcet winner (when one existed).  They're wrong: <i>every pixel</i>
in this picture where the IRV picture differs in color from the Voronoi pixel,
is a counterexample.
Observe that IRV gives "outsiders" or "extremists"
a large advantage over "centrists." [Note: if we tell IEVS to use more voters,
then the randomness in the pictures diminishes, but it costs a lot
more computer time.  In all these pictures, each pixel has <tt>TopYeeVoters=256</tt>
which, roughly, means that each pixel is based on votes from &asymp;2500 voters. I actually
prefer to use this parameter setting as opposed to trying much harder to take 
the number of voters to &infin;, because that way we can see the presence of
"near-tie election nightmares" easily in the picture.]:
</p>
<img src="assets/images/irv666.bmp" alt="irv666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/bucklin666.bmp" alt="bucklin666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/nauru666.bmp" alt="nauru666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/coombs666.bmp" alt="coombs666.bmp">
<p>
2nd from left above is
honest <b>Bucklin</b> voting, which I suppose exhibits better behavior than IRV
(since at least with Bucklin every candidate here can win), but which also has crazy,
severely non-convex and non-starshaped win-region shapes (despite the fact Bucklin 
is a "monotonic" voting method), and which also exhibits
win-regions (magenta at top and light grey at right) not containing their candidates.
Second from
right is <b>Nauru</b> voting, which seems for honest voters to improve over <b>Plurality</b>
(right hand picture <i>below</i>).
Rightmost is 
<b>Coombs</b> voting, which is the best-behaved of this
series for honest voters (although a complete disaster for strategic voters).
</p>
<p>
Here's a chain of related, but progressively less expressive and
hence (for honest voters) worse, voting methods.
We begin (lefthand picture below)
with honest (but "rescaled" &ndash; each voter rescales utilities so 
her best choice is 99 and her worst is 0 before voting them) <b>range</b> voting.
The picture is very similar to the Voronoi diagram, but slightly distorted;
and note that the magenta candidate is outside its win-region.
[If there were no rescaling, or if there were an additional candidate very far away (well outside
the pictured area) then the distortion would have been zero and range voting
would have yielded exactly the Voronoi diagram.]
(Honest <b>continuum cumulative</b> voting yields a picture almost indistinguishable from
range voting in this case.)
Honest <b>Borda</b> voting is the 2nd from left picture below &ndash; 
it behaves similarly, but now the distortion is larger,
and note that
4 candidates lie outside their win-regions
and that some win-regions have slightly (but clearly) non-convex shapes.
(Borda is less expressive than range voting since voters cannot express strength of preference.)
</p>
<img src="assets/images/range666.bmp" alt="range666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/borda666.bmp" alt="borda666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/dabagh666.bmp" alt="dabagh666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/plurality666.bmp" alt="plurality.bmp">
<p>
Honest <b>Dabagh</b> voting (picture 2nd from right above) is much less expressive
than Borda since Dabagh voters can indicate only their first and second choices.
On this candidate-set, Dabagh is a complete disaster.
Note how, incredibly, it actually <i>swaps</i> the brown and purple regions
&ndash; and the yellow and grey regions at the top left(?!) &ndash;
versus the Voronoi diagram. 
Finally at the far right is plain <b>plurality</b> voting, which is the least expressive of
all (voters can only indicate their top choice); 
it is in some ways even more of a disaster than Dabagh, obliterating all
the centrist candidates down to zero-win-regions (and the light-blue candidate is
not in its own win-region).  <b>Venzke's disqualified plurality</b> voting 
method (which is supposed to improve on plain plurality) yields the exact same picture
as regular plurality voting in this case.
</p>
<p>
Below are the four methods that (with range voting) are the best according
IEVS's Bayesian regret measurements. From left to right, 
<b>Range+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Approval(mean-based threshold)+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Brian Olson's IRNR system</b>,
and <b>Chris Benham's MCA system.</b>
(Some of these don't look too good, so how can these methods be the "best"? Well,
IEVS also takes account of a vast number of non-geometric scenarios.  Just because methods
do not perform terribly well in these Yee-type 2D geometric scenarios, does not
necessarily prevent good performance in others.)
Notice how the top-2-runoff between the top two range voting finishers tends
to help correct for distortions caused by "normalization" effects in plain range voting.
(It also tends to fix problems caused by "strategic voting," since even strategic voters
will vote honestly in the runoff round, but
that is not an issue here since these
pictures involve honest voters.)  Thus the range+top2runoff picture (left below) does 
look quite good, i.e. greatly resembles the optimum-winner (Voronoi diagram) picture.
IRNR looks worse (e.g. several winners not in their own win-regions, some weird shapes)  
but still not too bad,
albeit MCA and Approval+top2-runoff look pretty bad.

Below (left three) are two related voting methods based on eigenvector and Markov-chain ideas.
In the middle is the Voronoi diagram again (for comparison)
on the left is the <b>Keener eigenvector</b> system (which appears to behave very similarly
to Range and Borda), and on the right is <b>Sinkhorn</b>.
Note how Borda and Sinkhorn appear to favor the centrists (perhaps due to "teaming") in
contrast to honest plurality voting (rightmost picture two-above) which kills them
and favors the extremists (presumably as
a result of "cloning" or "vote splitting," which are the opposite of teaming).
On the far right (since we had to put it somewhere) is <b>Woodall-DAC</b>,
which note refuses to permit the dark-blue and dark-green candidates to win anywhere.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/WoodallDAC666.bmp" alt="WoodallDAC666.bmp">
<p>
On the left below is <b>Top median rating</b> which is like range voting but
based on median rating not average rating.  Presumably because of the less-smooth
functional dependence of median as opposed to average, top median rating exhibits
some strange pathologies not suffered by range, as well as many more
"near-tie nightmare" elections.  In contrast to range, it cannot be recommended 
even for honest voters. Second from left is <b>Lowest median rank</b>, which is
like top median rating and range, only worse due to less voter expressivity,
less smoothness, and more "near-tie nightmares."
</p>
<img src="assets/images/topmdrating666.bmp" alt="topmdrating666.bmp">

<img src="assets/images/voteforagainst666.bmp" alt="voteforagainst666.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/worst666.bmp" alt="worst666.bmp">
<p>
Second from right is <b>vote for and against</b> where you vote +1 for your favorite and -1 for
your most-hated candidate, and highest total score wins.  The reason it
looks like random dots everywhere is presumably because exact, and almost-exact, ties
are exceedingly common with this method (at least in 2D scenarios with honest voters).
A subjectively very similar picture happens with <b>anti-plurality</b> voting where
you simply vote against your most-hated, and the least-named candidate wins.  Again
(and more obviously), ties and near-ties are exceedingly common.  Both these failed methods
illustrate the importance of designing your voting method so as to make ties <i>un</i>common.
Finally, above on the far right
is the hypothetical societally <b>worst</b>-possible (social utility minimizing)
election method,
which, it may be proved, always coincides with the "furthest point Voronoi diagram":
</p>

<p>
We do not wish to give the misleading impression that
<b>vote for and against</b> and <b>anti-plurality</b> 
<i>always</i> yield a "random-dot" picture and
always a tie or near tie.  In the equilateral triangle and square 3- and 4-candidate
symmetrical scenarios we began with, both harmlessly yield the usual picture.
<!--
And in the following 3-candidate scenario,
both yield the (rather boring) picture below left
(which is certainly rather unfair &ndash; but at least,
it is not filled with election-ties):
</p>
<img src="assets/images/antiplurSqueeze.bmp" alt="antiplurSqueeze.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/antiplurRSqueeze.bmp" alt="antiplurRSqueeze.bmp">
-->

<!-- BUGGY
<p>
Below is <b>Rouse's method</b> (which is sort of like Nanson-Baldwin but with an extra level
of recursion).  Contrary to rumor, it is <i>not</i> a Condorcet method 
&ndash; there is a 3-vote, 3-candidate
counterexample, but without me telling it to you (and without you hunting for it:)
you can just see that immediately by observing
the discrepancies between the Rouse picture and the Voronoi diagram.
(These are not very large discrepancies, but they are quite real.)
</p>
<img src="assets/images/Rouse666.bmp" alt="Rouse666.bmp">
-->

<H3> Another random 14-point set (which turned out to have only 13 points...) </H3>
<p>
Range voting with "honest" voters (who cast <i>rescaled</i> utilities as their range votes &ndash;
rescaled so their best choice gets 99 and their worst 0) does <i>not</i>
yield the optimal Voronoi diagram &ndash; although it usually comes close
&ndash; but it does <i>if</i> there is some additional
"ultrabad" candidate very far away (far outside the bounds of the picture frame).
Here is a side-by-side comparison of Voronoi (on the left) and <b>range</b> (middle)
but for a different random 14-point set, 
(69,173), (152,133), (27,164), (162,46), (27,164), (82,156), (170,30), (116,129), 
(49,85), (114,101), (72,41), (134,118), (106,111), (81,83), [and the utility function is
1/&radic;(12000+Distance&sup2;) and the Gaussian has &sigma;=70 in each direction]
so you can see they differ (but not by a lot):

<p>
[Only count 13 candidates?  There are 2 candidates exactly co-located at (27, 164)
thanks to my brilliant random number generator...]
<b>Approval</b> voting with mean-utility as threshold
(righthand picture) also does <i>not</i> yield
the Voronoi diagram.  It obliterates many candidates and seems to favor
centrists over extremists.
This kind of voting can be regarded as what range voting will do but with <i>strategic</i>
voters acting with zero information about the other voters.
That illustrates the severe hit that we take when the voters become strategic rather than honest.
We'll examine that topic more soon...
</p>

<H3> More IRV pictures </H3>

<img src="assets/images/voronoi10E.bmp" alt="voronoi10E.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/irv10E.bmp" alt="irv10E.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/irv10D.bmp" alt="irv10D.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/irv10C.bmp" alt="irv10C.bmp">
<p>
The 3 pictures on the right are <b>IRV</b> 10-candidate elections for
random sets of 10 points; the middle two pictures actually are 
the <i>same</i> 10-point candidate-set but different pictures because of
having different standard deviations on their voter-gaussian.  
Lefthand picture is the corresponding <b>Voronoi</b> diagram.
Note the large number
of disconnected and/or bizzarre-shaped win-regions, including regions with "holes."
Note also the large number of "squeezed out" can-never-win IRV candidates, and the
commonness of "tough call elections" (random dot clouds covering substantial fractions
of the picture).   Every pixel in which the Voronoi
pixel color differs from the IRV pixel color, is an election where IRV refuses to elect a
Condorcet ("beats all") winner.
</p>

<H2> Cloning </H2>

<p>
The following pictures illustrate the effect of candidate "cloning."
Here is the situation before any cloning is done:
</p>
<img src="assets/images/VorNoClon6.bmp" alt="VorNoClon6.bmp">
<p>
Now clone the green candidate in the top right with 6 additional clones.
[&sigma;=100; 
Coordinates: 
(40, 40), (160, 160), (165, 169), (155, 169), 
(165, 151), (155, 151), (170, 160), (150, 160).]
</p><p>
The leftmost picture is the <b>Voronoi</b> diagram (Optimum,
Condorcet methods, Arrow-Raynaud, 
approval voting with oblivious threshold, etc.) which is immune to the effect of cloning.
[Actually many Condorcet methods are <i>not</i> clone-immune &ndash; but they all are
in the pictorial 2D scenarios studied here.]
The very different picture second from left is <b>Borda</b>, 
which is highly vulnerable to cloning.  Note how 
Borda's blue winning-region has shrunk drastically thanks to the cloning, 
to the extent where the blue candidate
nearly lies outside its own winning region.  
(Evicting a candidate from its winning region <i>can</i> occur
via cloning with Borda.)
With Borda, a party can simply run an army of essentially identical clones to assure victory.
</p>
<img src="assets/images/VorClon6.bmp" alt="VorClon6.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/BordaClon6.bmp" alt="BordaClon6.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/PlurClon6.bmp" alt="PlurClon6.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/IrvClon6.bmp" alt="IrvClon6.bmp">
<p>
Second from right is <b>Plurality</b> voting,
which also is highly vulnerable to cloning &ndash; but in the opposite manner.
Plurality voting tends to "split the vote" among the clones, killing them
and causing their opponent (blue)
to win.  Indeed, blue now wins so hugely that some of the clones diametrically
opposed to everything the blue candidate stands for, have had their
winning-regions entirely swallowed up by Blue  and indeed now lie within the blue region &ndash;
purely because their views happened to be <i>popular</i>!
(There also are a lot of "tough call" near-tie elections, which presumably
is additional "noise" caused by "spoiler" effects.)
At the far right is <b>IRV</b>, which is a method theoretically immune to cloning.
And indeed,
it successfully prevents the blue region from either growing or shrinking &ndash; although
it has some other problems in that it unfairly discriminates among the clones 
(favoring "extremists" over "centrists" as usual) and suffers
a lot of "tough call" near-tie elections in which the election outcome is almost random.
(Don't let anybody ever tell you that in IRV ties and near-ties are "negligibly rare.")

<img src="assets/images/RangeClon6.bmp" alt="RangeClon6.bmp">
<img src="assets/images/RangeXClon6.bmp" alt="RangeXClon6.bmp">
<p>
Above at left is <b>Sinkhorn</b> which seems to act like Borda but evidently is
even <i>more</i> vulnerable to cloning.  
Second from left is <b>Approval with mean-utility-as-threshold</b>.  
It theoretically should have comparatively good clone-immunity; and indeed the blue region
suffers only a little shrinkage &ndash; 
its main problem is unfair discrimination among the clones
(favoring "centrists" over "extremists" as usual).
Second from right is <b>Range</b> which is
theoretically immune to cloning and indeed exhibits good performance here, aside from
the usual distortion caused by
voter "re-normalization" when converting utilities into range scores.
That distortion vanishes if an additional "super-bad" candidate exists very far
away. To illustrate that, we re-run Range with a new 9th candidate at (1400, -1400) 
far outside the [0,199]x[0,199] picture window (rightmost image).
</p>
<p>
Below are the four methods that (with range voting) are the best according
IEVS's Bayesian regret measurements. From left to right, 
<b>Range+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Approval(mean-based threshold)+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Brian Olson's IRNR system</b>,
and <b>Chris Benham's MCA system.</b>
Technically speaking, as far as I know none of these 4 systems are cloneproof. 
However, as you can see they often exhibit behavior which seems a lot
like a cloneproof voting method.

Below-left is <b>Woodall-DAC</b>, a complicated but very interesting method which we 
do not recommend.
It may have its problems, but it has the virtue of being theoretically immune to 
candidate-cloning.  On the right is <b>Coombs</b> which is <i>not</i> clone-immune despite its
apparent similarity-of-definition to IRV (which is clone-immune):

<p>
In the IRV picture,
note how moving the center of society
<i>toward</i> the blue candidate can actually cause us to <i>leave</i> the 
blue-wins region and enter a red-wins or green-wins region.  
That is caused by "non-monotonicity."  
IRV proponents often claim that non-monotonicity is
a rare phenomenon in IRV elections.
But as you can see from this and other IRV pictures, it isn't all that rare.
</p>
<p>
The plurality picture illustrates maximally simply how the blue-wins region can fail to
contain the blue candidate.  Indeed, one can construct
3-candidate plurality elections in which the blue-wins
region is arbitrarily far-separated from the blue candidate.
</p>

<H2> Some 4-candidate elections (mostly suggested by Ka-Ping Yee) </H2>

<p>
From left to right: <b>Voronoi</b>, <b>Plurality</b>, <b>IRV</b> and <b>IRV again</b>
but now with many more (about 40000) voters per election (each pixel is one election).
As you can see, IRV yields a rather peculiar-shaped red win-region.
This also illustrates a common phenomenon in IRV elections that I call the "shadow world."
That is, the win regions in IRV are polygonal, but you often get shadowy
polygonal regions filled with random dots kind of lying on top of real regions. 
These "shadow" regions go away when you vastly increase the number of voters per 
election, making it
clear they are caused by "noise" due to "tough-to-call" elections.  However, it is
often difficult to tell (without enormous computer time expenditure)
which regions are "real" and which are "shadows."
In the present case it takes about 200,000 voters per election before the boundaries
in the picture finally appear crisp (the shape from the 40000-voter picture
is genuine).
In practice, elections in
the shadow regions would have almost-random outcome or would lead to election administration
"chad counting" nightmares.

The three pictures below
from left to right: <b>Voronoi</b>, <b>Plurality</b>, and <b>IRV</b>.
Both this and the above picture
illustrate how plurality elections with honest voters
can "squeeze out"
a candidate, unfairly preventing it from winning <i>anywhere</i>.  Also, we have
below two examples in the same picture of IRV featuring <i>two-component
disconnected</i> win regions (for green and yellow) &ndash; and the green candidate does
not even lie inside its own win-region.

Below from left to right are 
<b>Voronoi</b>, <b>Plurality</b>, <b>IRV</b>,
and <b>IRV again</b> now with many more (about 40000) voters per pixel-election.
Two of the plurality winners lie outside their win-regions.  The rightmost IRV picture
demonstrates something truly amazing &ndash; a win region containing a <i>hole</I>
with no apparent reason for existing.  The blue sea contains a triangular green "island."
Why is it there?  The green candidate is not anywhere near, indeed it lies outside
both the blue and green win-regions.  Yee has verified that the green island is genuine
(indeed, with 200,000 voters per pixel, it crispens up and becomes somewhat larger),
not a fake "shadow."  However, that is far from clear from the "shadow world" situation in
the first IRV picture.
This island has the property that the more voters you use per pixel, the
larger and clearer it appears.  Every election in the island is "tough to call"
and the situation only clarifies when <i>many</i> votes are counted.

"Squeeze out" is not a problem solely afflicting plurality voting. It can also
occur with IRV.  Below on the left is
<b>Voronoi</b>, middle is  <b>IRV</b> and on the right is <b>Plurality</b>; 
the centrist yellow candidate loses
everywhere under both IRV and Plurality (honest) voting.
