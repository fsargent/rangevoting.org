<H3> Plan/Goals  </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Learn: What range voting is, what some other voting systems are, compare
properties.
<LI>
If time, learn about "Bayesian Regret" and our computer simulations indicating objective
sense RV better than all common voting system proposals
<LI>
Separate minitalk introduces "Proportional Representation" multiwinner voting systems
<LI>
These talk-slides will appear on web at 
<A

<h3>Plan:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Define</b> Plurality, IRV, Approval, Range, Borda, &amp; Condorcet voting methods.
Do examples.
</li><li>
<b>Compare</b> them in terms of a set of properties I think the CO legislators
should care about, including
<ol type="a">
<li>
"voter expressiveness"
</li><li>
"participation,"
</li><li>
"favorite betrayal" &amp; "spoilers"
</li><li>
"clone immunity,"
</li><li>
"monotonicity,"
</li><li>
(perhaps, if mucho time: DH3 pathology & response on removal of
"irrelevant loser")
</li><li>
reaction to strategic voting  (some theorems)
</li><li>
Tendency to elect "extremists" or "centrists"?
</li><li>
"additivity" and ability to count in precincts vs statewide
</li><li>
"Burr Dilemma"
</li><li>
how people react to these systems &ndash;
   Are they too complicated?  Error rates. Honesty rates.  Exit poll
studies. Backsliding.  Etc.
</li><li>
ability/inability to use simple non-computerized voting machines
</li><li>
worries about "near-tie" chad-counting &amp; election administering
"nightmares"
</li><li>
election auditability &amp; security issues
</li></ol>
Will illustrate most of those with simple election examples, sample ballots,
</li><li>
<b>Bayesian Regret</b> and how it indicates Range
is the "best" of these systems.
</li><li>
<b>Real-world</b> political
elections examples from
Democrats, Republicans, other countries; "2-party domination";
&amp; how it would benefit politicians, not just how it would
benefit voters.
</li><li>
Primaries?  Influence of Cash?  **3parties as Insurance??
</li><li>
Who uses Range Voting? Valedictorians, Olympics, <b>Honeybees</b>...
</li><li>
**Introduction to <b>"proportional representation"</b>
multiwinner systems.
</li></ol>

<h3> Here's what motivates <i>me</i>...???omit </h3>
<br>
1. We argue "range voting" is the best single-winner voting method
among all commonly proposed alternatives.  Measurements &amp; estimates 
<a href="LivesSaved.html">indicate</a>
that if adopted instead of the currently most-used system, "plurality voting,"
humanity's lot would improve by an amount comparable to or exceeding the
improvement got from switching from undemocratic forms of government to
democracy.   Conservative estimate:
each day's delay in getting range voting
costs (in statistical sense) 5000 lives.
</p><p>
2. We argue (by analysing an explicit political <a href="StratSumm.html">strategy</a>
to get it)
range voting is, in fact, an obtainable dream.

Speaker is  mathematician who co-founded the CRV in 2005.

<H3>Are many other voting systems too...  Also there are many <I>Variant Rules</I> for these systems... </H3>
<P>Australia forces IRV voters to rank-order <I>every</I> candidate. Other 
places allow voters only to order <I>some</I> &amp; omit others (automatically 
last-ranked). Some places force voters to rank their top K choices (for some 
fixed value K, such as 2 or 3) but no more. In range-voting, "no opinion" ("X") 
scores can also be permitted; these do not affect a candidate's average (then is 
common to refuse to permit somebody to win if he has too-few genuine, i.e. 
numerical, scores).

<OL>
  <LI>With IRV usually only about 7 of the 14 candidates can ever win. The other 
  7 are "zeroed out" and can never win, even when they are exactly located at 
  the center of the voter distribution. 
  <LI>The 7 favored candidates are usually the 7 "extremists." The 7 "centrists" 
  (located nearest the center of the picture) tend to be the ones IRV zeros out. 
  The "extremist" win-regions grow into, invade, and take over "centrist 
  territory." 
  <LI>IRV also exhibits some other strange phenomena. In several cases, a 
  candidate has a <I>disconnected</I> win-region, for example the yellow region 
  in the leftmost picture. (Why is that yellow "island" there in the middle of 
  the olive-green "sea"? The yellow candidate is nowhere near. Surely the three 
  candidates that actually <I>are</I> located on the island ought to win there? 
  But no &ndash; IRV never permits any of them to win.) There are also several other 
  "islands" and split win-regions in these pictures. 
  <LI>It turns out that every pixel where the IRV color disagrees with the 
  Optimum color is an example of a situation in which IRV refuses to elect a 
  "beats-all winner" who would defeat every opponent head-to-head. Some 
  IRV-defenders have contended that such behavior is very rare. As you can see, 
  that is not so; it can be quite common &ndash; happens for roughly 1/4 of the pixels 
  in each IRV picture. You are looking at about 40,000 examples of this "very 
  rare" behavior. 
  <LI>Why the "random dot" regions? "Tough call" near-tie elections... </LI></OL>

2007 PILOT PROGRAM - M100 METHODOLOGY - VOTING

When the Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) method is used for a particular contest,
voting for one's top choice or choices is the same as if IRV were not used.
Each voter is allowed to vote for as many candidates as there are seats to be
filled in column A (see Exhibit I – Example IRV Ballot).

Each voter is then allowed the opportunity to indicate two alternate candidate choices, 
one per column in each of columns B and C, ranked in order of preference.

The voter has the option to choose alternate candidates.

For example, in the Office of Mayor contest there is one seat to be
filled. Each voter may vote for one candidate in column A, and then may indicate
a first alternate candidate choice in column B, and a second alternate candidate
choice in column C. In the City Council contest there are four seats to be filled. 
Each voter may vote for as many as four candidates in column A, and then may
indicate a first alternate candidate choice in column B, and a second
alternate candidate choice in column C.

COUNTING - FIRST ROUND
Only column A will be considered in the first round of counting.
If a voter overvotes in column A, no votes in that contest on that ballot will be
considered.  A voter may undervote in column A.
In the first round of counting, all ballots will be counted exactly
as if IRV were not used, with the exception that any results from columns B and C 
will be ignored.
If a sufficient number of candidates receive total votes exceeding the threshold of
victory for all seats in that contest to be filled, normal procedures apply
and there will be no need for a second round of counting. If all the seats are not
filled, those candidates which have won seats will be removed from further
consideration, and a number of candidates not exceeding twice the
number of remaining seats to be filled will advance to the second round of
counting, those candidates being the ones with the greatest numbers of first round
votes.

COUNTING - SECOND ROUND
If a second round of counting is required, the counting shall be
performed according to the following procedures:

A) Counting a single-seat contest:
1) Ballots shall be maintained in separate groups according to where or
how they were cast, by precinct or one-stop polling locations, or by
mail.
2) For each such group, ballots shall be separated into four stacks,
designated Stack A, Stack B, Stack C, and Stack O.
3) If a ballot was overvoted in column A, it shall be placed into
Stack O.
4) If a ballot contains a vote in column A for either runoff
candidate, it
shall be placed into Stack A. Because these votes have already been
counted in the first round, there is no need to count them again.
5) If a ballot does not contain a vote in column A for either runoff
candidate, but does contain a vote in column B for either runoff
candidate, it shall be placed into Stack B.
6) If a ballot does not contain a vote in either column A or B for
either runoff candidate, it shall be placed into Stack C.
7) Stack B ballots shall be counted by machine or by hand. Only those
votes cast for either runoff candidate in column B shall be considered.
These totals shall be added to the totals for those candidates from the
first round of counting.
8) Stack C ballots shall be counted by machine or by hand. Only those
votes cast for either runoff candidate in column C shall be considered.
These totals shall also be added to the totals for those candidates from
the first round of counting.
9) Repeat steps 1-8 as necessary until all ballots for the entire
jurisdiction have been counted.
10) The runoff candidate with the greatest total votes shall be
declared the winner.
B) Counting a multi-seat contest:
1) Ballots shall be maintained in separate groups according to where or
how they were cast, by precinct or one-stop polling locations, or by
mail.
2) For each such group, ballots shall be separated into five stacks,
designated Stack A, Stack B, Stack B2, Stack C, and Stack O.
3) If a ballot was overvoted in column A, it shall be placed into
Stack O.
4) If a ballot contains as many votes in column A as there are total
seats to be filled, and all such votes are for candidates who either won seats
in the first round or advanced to the second round, it shall be placed
into Stack A. Because these votes have already been counted in the
first round, there is no need to count them again.
5) If a ballot contains in column A exactly one undervote or exactly one
vote for a candidate who did not win a seat in the first round and did
not advance to the second round, and does contain a vote in column B
for any runoff candidate not already voted for in column A, it shall be
placed into Stack B.
6) If a ballot contains in column A more than one undervote or more than
one vote for candidates who did not win seats in the first round and did
not advance to the second round or at least one of each of these, and

voted for in column A, it shall be placed into Stack B2.

<H2>How "honest" versus how "strategic" are voters? </H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Plurality: about <B>90%</B> of voters with Nader or Buchanan favorite (in 
  USA 2000) actually voted for somebody else. <I>Huge</I> strategic dishonesty. 
  (Devastates USA "third parties." Massive 2-party domination in USA: 99.5%.) 
  <LI>IRV: less clear at present, but every IRV-using country has developed 
  massive 2-party domination in all IRV seats. ("Spoiler effect" still happens, 
  remember.) 
  <LI>Range voting: surprise! A lot of voter "honesty" and non-strategy. Only 
  about <B>25%</B> of range voters vote in maximally-strategic, 
  maximally-exaggerating-for-punch, "approval style" (all 9s and 0s, no 
  intermediate scores). [See: <A href="http://math.temple.edu/~wds/homepage/works.html">
USA range voting study (paper #82)</A>, <A HREF="OrsayTable.html">French RV study</A> or our <a href="index.html?%3F">TX governor race exit study</A>]
</LI></UL>
<P>Good. More voter honesty &#8658; better, less-strategically-distorted election 
results for all. But why happens? </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Psychological reasons &ndash; Range gives them more expressiveness and ability 
  to be honest, and they don't want to waste that? 
  <LI>Experiment on yourself! Do you <I>want</I> to give every candidate 9 or 0? 
  You really don't want to, do you? 
  <LI>Some strategic imperatives motivate more than others. Voters say "why 
  should I dishonestly say the Socialist gets a zero, when honestly I feel he 
  deserves 3 out of 9?" Socialist has no chance anyway, many voters aren't so 
  worried they feel they need to lie to kill him off. Non-strong motivation to 
  be strategically dishonest. Hence a lot of useful honesty will happen. 
  <LI>Result (in our range voting USA exit poll in 2004): <I>hugely</I> more 
  votes for third-party contenders relative to Bush &amp; Kerry (but they still 
  lost) </LI></UL>

<A name=cash></A>
<H2>Importance of CASH as opposed to QUALITY </H2>
<P>August 2007. Ames, Iowa. Romney overwhelmingly wins GOP straw poll. (Results 
delayed due to malfunctioning Diebold voting machines.) Romney spent <I>$1 
million</I> on TV ads and to bus thousands of his supporters to Ames (many-hour 
bus rides, free wining &amp; dining) and pay "poll tax" fees so they could vote 
for him in this poll! Far-outspent all rivals. </P>
<P><I>Why</I> pay $1 million to fakely-win a <I>straw poll</I>??? Senseless? 
Unfortunately, is method to this madness. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Plurality voting &#8658; strange dynamics. 
  <LI>Voters strategically foolish to vote for anybody not in top two. 
  (Otherwise your vote "wasted.") 
  <LI>So you have to convince voters you are in the top two. 
  <LI>Not about convincing them you are the <I>best</I>. About convincing them 
  you are <I>leading</I>. That takes CASH. 
  <LI>Politicians call this "momentum." 
  <LI>Then voters "strategically forced" to vote for you and donors "forced" to 
  give $ to you. (Like it or not.) 
  <LI>So by creating a fake-lead in Iowa, Romney could well actually get a 
  <I>real</I> lead (or real 2nd-place) in Iowa; that in turn gives him 
  "momentum" in the USA as a whole! </LI></UL>
<P>BUT politics would be <I>HEALTHIER</I> if it were not about cash, not about 
constructing PR-illusions, not about "momentum" and trying to force voters to 
vote for you even though they dislike you &ndash; and more about actual 
candidate-<I>quality.</I> (You can be good quality choice <I>without</I> 
$millions.) </P>
<P>With favorite-safe systems like Range Voting, voter <I>not</I> "strategically 
forced" to vote against her true favorite when others lead in polls. Cash and 
faking leads are less important and quality is more important. </P>
<H3>Primaries </H3>
<P>Republican Party would <I>also</I> be healthier. Suppose Romney is 
poor-quality <I>but</I> manages to win the GOP nomination via such manipulations 
(made possible by plurality voting system in primaries and in straw polls). 
<I>Then the entire GOP has been hurt</I> and likely to lose presidency to a 
Democrat. Suppose GOP instead were to use <I>range voting</I> in primary and 
straw polls. Then would tend to nominate higher-quality candidates. That helps 
entire GOP and gives them better chances against the Democrat nominee 
(especially if the Dems foolishly do not use range voting in <I>their</I> 
primaries, hence they nominate low-quality choice). </P>
<P>(And could make the same argument about Hillary Clinton from the Dems' perspective...)
</P>
<H3>D &amp; R parties &ndash; listen up! Our computer sims &#8658; you will gain 
&#8776;<A href="RandElect.html">30-60%</A> better 
chances to win the presidency if your party switches to range voting primaries! 
</H3>
<P>
Iowa 2008.  10 Rs, 10 Ds competing.  Plurality system:  voters "strategically forced"
to vote for one of the "leading 2" even if not their favorite; we get the best-of-two.
(E.g. Hillary Clinton
probably one of the two.  Even if 65% of Dem voters want non-Hillary, HC could still
easily win Dem nomination due to anti-HC vote-split, etc.) 
Range voting: more like we get best of all 10.  Which yields better result for the USA 
(and for your party's chances in the later general election)?
<P>
Because expect 10 Dem &amp; 10 Repub candidates in primaries, range voting will
have maximized <i>quality advantage</i> versus
plurality &amp; approval.  <a href="RandElect.html#RangePlur">Computer sims</a>:

<H2>How to evaluate/compare voting systems &amp; seek best &ndash; 4 ways </H2>
<DL>
  <DT><B>0. Compare "properties" (as we've been doing)</B>
  <DD>Pros: Educational.  Cons: which properties matter and how much, is <I>subjective</I> and eternally <I>debatable</I>; also just because a method fails some property
<I>logically</I>, tells you nothing about how <I>frequent</I> and how <I>serious</I>
that property-failure is in practice.   
  <DT><B>1. Look at human elections through <A 
  href="FunnyElections.html">history</A>, or artificial 
  ones (paid subjects).</B> 
  <DD>Pros: Real; right sample space. <BR>Cons[Historical]: Often hard to assess 
  how "good" different election results were or would have been and what results 
  "would" have occurred had other election method X had been used instead. (And 
  subjective. And you'll be accused of bias.) Also, still not really correct 
  sample space (since space might <A 
  href="Duverger.html">change</A> over time with new 
  X...). <BR>Cons[Paid subjects]: Very expensive. Not really real. 
  <BR>Cons[Both]: Little data &#8658; low statistical significance &#8658; few results. And 
  people lie to pollsters. 
  <DT><B>2. Has Darwinian Evolution (or "Intelligent design")
made any animals that vote as important part of their life-cycle?</B>
  <DD> Yes! Already been done at least twice (social insects)!! 
  <I>Hundreds of trillions</I> of very-important-to-the-insects elections so 
  far! <I>All</I> voting systems considered (in some sense). 
  Real (arguably more real than with humans - more years, more important to lives). 
  Lots of data &#8658; high 
  significance.  
  <DT><B>3. Measure "Bayesian regret" of different election methods via computer 
  election simulations. </B>
  <DD>Pros: Large amounts of data &#8658; statistical significance is no problem. 
  Artificial cyber-voters better than humans: Can read their "minds" to find 
  their true desires unpolluted by lies (measured in standard "happiness units" 
  too). <BR>Cons: Computer results out = only as good as the assumptions &amp; 
  models in. Only try voting systems you try, not all possible. <BR>Pros: Can 
  try large number of assumption sets &amp; models. If so lucky that in 
  <I>all</I> of them, one voting method robustly is best, convincing. <BR>Con:

  <LI>Each voter has a personal "utility" value for the election of each 
  candidate. (E.g., if Nixon is elected, then Jill Voter acquires -55 extra 
  lifetime happiness units.) In computer simulation, "voters" &amp; "candidates" 
  are artificial, and the utility numbers are generated by some randomized 
  "utility generator" and assigned artificially to each candidate-voter pair. 
  <LI>Now the voters vote, based both on their private utility values, and (if 
  strategic voters) on their perception from "pre-election polls" (also 
  generated artificially within the simulation, e.g. from a random subsample of 
  "people") of how the other voters are going to act. <BR><FONT size=-1>(Note. 
  Some people here have gotten the wrong impression that this is <I>assuming</I> 
  that voters will be "honest" or that we are assuming that honest range voters

  correct: These assumptions are not made.)</FONT> 
  <LI>Election system E elects some winning candidate W.

<H2>Introduction to <B>"proportional representation"</B> multiwinner systems 
</H2>
<P>If 51% Democrat voters, you could easily get 100% Democrat winners. 
(Massachusetts.) 51% Women voters, but way less than 51% women in the Senate. 
12% Black voters, but way fewer in Senate. Only one atheist ever served in 
congress (or so they claim). Etc. </P>
<P>This is <I>disproportionality.</I> Many people feel it would be better if 
representatives were more... representative. For a voting system to offer any 
<I>guarantee</I> of that, it needs to be for <I>multiwinner</I> elections, e.g. 
17-candidate, 5-winner elections. </P>
<P>Many naive ways to turn single-winner methods into multiwinner ones (e.g. 
"multiwinner plurality" where the top-W finishers win the W seats and you are 
granted W plurality votes) can totally fail to deliver proportional results. 
North Carolina's IRV-variant for multiwinner elections should tend to deliver 
100% Democrat (or 100% Republican) winners, contrary to the professed 
aims of those behind that legislation. </P>
<P>"Hare/Droop reweighted STV" system (used in Ireland) is complicated. Involves 
rank-ordering votes, "reweighting" of votes so when X wins, then those who voted X 
now have their votes "deweighted" according to a magic formula, and then 
continue on to select next winner (then new reweighting) etc. Formula must be 
just right to get "proportionality theorem." Bizarre voter strategies (e.g. 
intentionally vote for no-hoper so your vote will retain high weight on an iffy 
seat; intentional vote-splitting in exactly the right proportions choreographed 
by parties distributing randomized "how to vote" cards) have been observed. </P>
<P>In "party list" systems (used in many countries, Germany, Israel, 
Netherlands) you do not vote for <I>candidates</I>, you vote for <I>parties</I>. 
A party with 27% of the votes gets 27% of the seats. But... that totally removes 
<I>individual accountability</I> and can have heavy biases based on party-size. 
(E.g. what if you aren't <I>in</I> a party?) </P>
<P>Harder to compare multiwinner systems ("Bayesian Regret" methodology only 
works for single-winner systems) and "properties" more complicated &amp; less 
understood. </P>
<P>There is a provably-proportional multiwinner version of range voting called 
<a href="RRV.html">reweighted range voting</a (RRV). It seems both simpler and better than 
Ireland's STV scheme and in the 1-winner case it is Range (better than IRV). 
</P>
<P>By act of Congress, multiwinner elections are currently <I>illegal</I> in the 
USA for Federal seats. </P>

<H2>Proportional Representation versus Single-Winner / Summary</H2>

<ol>
<li>
Single-winner voting systems "nonrepresentative" but aim to pick 
highest-quality winner. PR systems (involve <i>multi</i>winner elections)
sacrifice both perceived winner quality and accountability of politicians to voters,
but seek to produce winners more "representative" of the electorate.
</li><li>
Range voting is single-winner and hence not PR.
<small>However, there 
is an alternate form of Range Voting designed for multiwinner elections and designed to exhibit proportionality,
called 
<a href="RRV.html">reweighted range voting</a> (RRV) &ndash; described in
paper #78 at <a href="http://math.temple.edu/~wds/homepage/works.html">http://math.temple.edu/~wds/homepage/works.html</a>.
</small>
</li><li>
PR federal elections are <a href="SupremeCt.html">plausibly</a>
<i>unconstitutional</i> in the USA.
If are constitutional, then conceivably PR could be achieved in the House of Representatives
at least as far as the large states are concerned (but this probably would exacerbate 
power imbalance between large versus small states); but PR would be unachievable for
Senate, US Presidency, and state governorships.
</li><li>
Which approach is better?  Unclear philosophically, unclear
based on historical evidence, and unclear based on economic statistical evidence.
No consensus exists.
</li><li>
Therefore I am <i>unsure</i> PR is an improvement &ndash; but feel <i>confident</i> that 
switching from plurality voting to 
range voting is an improvement.
<small>(Much easier to <i>understand</i> and <i>measure</i>
the relative quality of <i>single</i>-winner voting systems since can use 
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>,
but no analogous quantity known for multiwinner systems.)</small>
</li><li>
PR tends to get rid of 2-party domination.
But not the only way to do that.
The plurality + top-2-runoff(2nd round) 
single-winner system <a href="HonestRunoff.html">led</a>
in most or all of the large number of countries in which it has been tried,
to having more than 2 important parties.
</li><li>
The very fact that neither PR nor non-PR (mainly plurality-voting-based)
democracies exhibit obvious superiority
over the other suggests that a democracy based on 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range</a> or Approval voting
could
be significantly superior to either (since good reason to believe it
will be significantly superior to plurality-based majoritarian democracy).

<H2>Asset Voting &ndash; the simplest PR system (but untried) </H2>
<P>There is one <I>remarkably simple</I> but <I>unconventional</I> kind of 
provably-proportional voting: <B>Asset Voting.</B> "Unconventional" because 
<I>both</I> the voters and the candidates participate. (Warning: this bothers a 
lot of people, and also prevents asset voting from being used at all in 
abstract scenarios with candidates that are not people, such as choosing pizza 
flavors.) Asset proven (in terms of certain criteria) superior to <i>any</i> 
"conventional" system. </P>
<P><B>Forest Simmons' simplified version of
<u>Asset voting</u> to elect W winners from C candidates, 0 &lt; W &lt; C:</B> 
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Each vote is "name one candidate" (plurality-style).
  <LI>A candidate's "score" is the number of times he is named.
  <LI>Now regard each score as the amount of an "asset" now owned by 
  that candidate. The candidates now negotiate; any subset of them may 
  redistribute their assets among themselves. 
  <LI>After all negotiations and redistributions end, the W "wealthiest" 
  candidates win. </LI></OL>
<P><SMALL>In variants, only certain kinds of redistributions are permitted, for 
example the candidates in increasing order of "wealth" drop out, redistributing 
their assets among the remaining ones as they do so. This "poorest first" 
variant has the advantage that it forces the procedure to <I>end</I> quickly and 
everybody <I>knows</I> when it has ended. </SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>
You can also 
compromise and, e.g, provide the voter with <I>three</I> plurality-style 
ballots, enabling her to split up her vote three ways &ndash; or fewer by using more 
than one ballot to vote for the same candidate. </SMALL></P>

<P>This is a make-believe analogue of the 2000 US presidential election. It's 
unrealistic in several ways, the most obvious being that it was a 
<I>one</I>-winner election, not a multiwinner election (asset voting <I>can</I> 
be used for single-winner elections but is <I>intended</I> for 
more-than-one-winner elections). Ignore the unreality. We are just trying to 
illustrate how it might work in a simple and familiar way. </P>
<P>In this election, Nader could decide to drop out of the picture and award his 
20 asset points to Gore. (Both Bush and Gore would, no doubt, try to make deals 
with Nader to try to get his assets. But, let us suppose that Nader, after 
considering his options, the offered deals, and the fact he considered his views 
closer to Gore's than to Bush's, preferred Gore.) In that case, Gore would win 
with 37+20=57 asset points to Bush's 38. (Buchanan could <I>also</I> decide to 
give his assets to some candidate, but in the particular scenario here, 
Buchanan's decision would not be able to change the winner.) </P>
<P>Now if this <I>were</I> a <i>2</i>-winner election, then both Bush and Gore would be 
winners no matter what Nader and Buchanan decided to do (albeit either Bush or 
Gore could in theory cause either Nader or Buchanan to be a winner by 
sacrificing their own chances &ndash; not likely). </P><BR>
