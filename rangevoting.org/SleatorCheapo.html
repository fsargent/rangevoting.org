<H2> Sleator's "cheapo" plan for semi-secure voting </H2>

<p><small>By Danny Sleator with Warren Smith.</small></p>

<p>
CMU professor and  computer scientist <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator">Danny Sleator</a>
objected that the <a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">Rivest/Smith ThreeBallot, VAV</a>, 
and similar secure voting
plans, although
about as simple as could possibly be hoped for, 
still were either just too complicated or too great a change in current
procedures, to easily gain acceptance.
To overcome that, Sleator invented the following, which I call in his honor, the
"cheapo" plan.  It is simpler and easier, at the cost of providing somewhat less security.
</p>

<H3> The plan </H3>

<p>
We use a normal
optical scan ballot, except that each ballot has a serial
number on it.  When I'm about to vote, with probability say
p&asymp;1%, I'm selected to be a "receipt voter."  Otherwise I'm a
regular voter.  If I'm a regular voter, I just mark my
ballot, check it with the machine, and put it in the ballot
box.  If I'm a receipt voter, then the machine issues me a
duplicate copy of my ballot which I take home with me.
</p>
<p>
Then, just like the 
<a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">ThreeBallot</a>
system, all ballots are posted on a web
site, along with the corresponding serial number.  The
voters who get receipts can check that their vote has been
properly posted.  Any large scale fraud would be provably detected
because it would have
overwhelming probability of modifying many of the receipt
votes.  It's of course essential that nobody know which
voters (or which serial numbers) got receipts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slight security hole:</b>
The receipt voter could sell his vote.  But the incentive is
pretty small, since I'll only get a receipt with such a
small probability.  You should probably know whether or not
you're going to get a receipt immediately before you vote.  So vote
buying can only affect a maximum of 1% of the voters.
</p>

<H2> Criticisms </H2>

<p>
<b>1.
The value p&asymp;1%</b> may be
too small.  If the government decides to cheat and move the election by 1%
to swing it, then the total number of voters who are proveably defrauded=1%*1%,
the total number of voters who are provably defrauded <i>and</i>
protest=1%*1%*1%, which is 1 in a million.
That might not be high enough.
(The government could just round up the few protestors and 
shoot them, at that point.)  Perhaps a better value is p&asymp;10%.
(Sleator's point is, whatever is the <i>best</i> value of p, must be better than
the current system which has p=0.)
</p>

<p>
<b>2.
Bundling</b> multiple races onto one ballot is a big mistake because
then a giant number of patterns are possible on that ballot, allowing
the voter to sell his (<i>un</i>copied) vote to a bidder who specifies
the full pattern and looks on the bulletin board later
to be sure it got posted.
This remark rather hurts Sleator's original intent of staying as close
as possible to current procedures.
</p>

<p><b>Sleator responds to this bundling criticism:</b>
Suppose we fix it this way.  Each race (or
each candidate in the case of range voting) on each ballot
has its own serial number.  The presentation on the web site
is totally unbundled.  However, for simplicity to the
receipt voter, the whole thing is copied and left bundled.
This should work fine.
</p>

<p>
The thing I haven't really figured out cleanly is how to
make sure that the pollworkers don't end up knowing which
ballots were copied and which weren't.  Maybe everybody gets
a folded up piece of paper when they leave.  The receipt
voters get a copy.  Everybody else gets garbage.  The
instructions on the outside of the paper says "Open this
when you get home.  If it's a receipt, check it against the
web site, otherwise just throw it out."
</p>

<p>
<b>3.
Collusive attacks</b> 
were discussed in the 
<a href="Rivest3B.html#collusive">old 3ballot full details</a>
page.
Sleator's cheapo scheme is vulnerable to them too
(although by adjusting the value of <i>p</i> we can hope to get the optimal tradeoff
between vulnerability to vote-buying and vulnerability
to collusive attacks).
It is possible to use the same fixes we recommend there to defend against
those attacks, also here, but that makes it more
complicated, which goes against Sleator's game plan of keeping everything maximally simple.
