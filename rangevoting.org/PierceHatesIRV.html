Pierce County spent a lot of money on a new voting method for a few
county offices in November's election, and most voters didn't
like it a bit.
Auditor Pat McCarthy said ranked-choice voting will cost county
taxpayers about $1.7 million, which is half of the overall $3.4 million
it cost to put on the 2008 general election.
</p><P>
Although Pierce County voters changed the county charter last year to
allow the new voting method, it appears they've changed their
collective mind. Two of three voters who responded to a survey were
opposed to the concept.
</p><P>
"It was overwhelming," McCarthy told members of the state Senate
Government Operations and Elections Committee on Friday. "The
majority did not like it."
</p><P>
That was based on nearly 91,000 voters who filled out a questionnaire
that accompanied mail-in ballots.
</p><P>
Ranked-choice voting, sometimes called instant runoff voting, allowed
voters to indicate their first, second and third choice in a race. If no
candidate gets more than 50 percent of the total number of votes in the
first round of counting, the second choice on ballots of the last-place
candidate are then counted. That continues until one candidate finally
gets a majority.
</p><P>
McCarthy, who won a close election in a four-way race for county
executive, joined election officials from Yakima and Chelan counties to
give state lawmakers a report on the election. The state used online
voter registration, and 37 of the 39 counties &ndash; all but King and
Pierce &ndash; conducted their elections entirely by mail.
</p><P>
Pierce was the only county to use ranked-choice voting, and for only a
few county races. Pierce voters got a second, conventional ballot to
vote for president, governor, Congress and local races.
</p><P>
McCarthy said she considered the election "an amazing success,"
even though she didn't care much for the new method. She said the
computer system and algorithms worked and that most voters understood
how to fill out the ballots.
</p><P>
State Sen. Pam Roach, R-Auburn, a committee member, took issue with that
assessment.
</p><P>
"How can you say it was a success when voters didn't know who
the executive was for two weeks?" Roach asked. "That absolutely
was a disaster."
</p><P>
Processing ranked-choice ballots did slow down the tally, McCarthy said,
but the method had nothing to do with how close the races were. Her own
race for executive wasn't decided until three weeks. But McCarthy
pointed out that a couple of legislative races were so close that even
using conventional voting methods, they required a recount and
weren't decided until earlier this week.
</p><P>
The decision to adopt the new voting method was approved by 53 percent
of voters. McCarthy said she thinks voters were eager to switch to
something else because they were still angry about the previous election
when they were forced to pick a Democratic, Republican or other
political party's slate of candidates.
</p><P>
She said she hopes the County Council will give voters a chance to
reconsider the charter amendment that created ranked-choice voting.
</p><P>
Susan Eidenschink, treasurer of the Tacoma-Pierce County League of Women
Voters, blamed the long lines at the polls on Election Day on
McCarthy's decision to have fewer polling places.
</p><P>
"We're interested in seeing it expanded," she said of ranked
choice. "We feel it definitely deserves more of a trial than this
one election."
</p><P>
Krist Novoselic, chairman of FairVote, echoed that sentiment. The former
Nirvana bassist is now a local government official in rural Wahkiakum
County and said he's worked to get Memphis, Tenn., and Telluride,
Colo., to try ranked-choice voting.
</p><P>
Committee chairwoman Sen. Darlene Fairley, D-Lake Forest Park, said
she's been listening for years to people and groups who are
supporters of the new voting method, but she has no interest in seeing
it extend beyond the borders of Pierce County.
</p><P>
"I'm with those folks who said they were confused," Fairley
said.
</p><P>
"This sounds just insane," said Sen. Eric Oemig, D-Kirkland, a
committee member.
