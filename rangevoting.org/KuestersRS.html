<H2> A bust to Rivest-Smith ThreeBallot and VAV "anti-fraud voting" protocols?  </H2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith 16 May 2011</small></p>
<p>
Ralf K&uuml;sters, Tomasz Truderung, and Andreas Vogt
(all at University of Trier, Germany) in a preliminary (2011) paper titled
<a href="index.html?%3F">Verifiability, Privacy, and Coercion-Resistance: New
Insights from a Case Study</a>,
found an unexpected bust of the 
<a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">Rivest-Smith</a> low-tech
"secure/antiFraud voting" schemes "ThreeBallot" and "VAV." 
</p><p>
However, in practice this "bust" looks to be not as severe a problem
as it might at
first seem, and at present it still looks likely that Rivest-Smith
would, if implemented,
raise voting in <i>large</i> elections to new levels of security far beyond
what humanity ever
accomplished previously.   Unfortunately the KTV attack seems serious in
<i>small</i> secret-ballot elections.
</p><p>
I will now try to explain the bust, and then explain considerations which
appear, for large elections, to "bust the bust."

<h3> The KTV attack </h2>
<p>
They assume there are a large (but minority) set of dishonest voters and
(collaborating with them) a dishonest central election authority. The
dishonest voters each cast (in an A versus B election using "ThreeBallot")
</p><center>
   <tt>xo, ox, ox</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  [which would have been a vote for B and against A]
</center><p>
keeping the first SingleBallot for receipt purposes.   Dishonest Voter
phones her
dishonest contact at the central authority to inform them of her SingleBallot's
serial number.
The dishonest central authority uses that information to mispost her   <tt>xo</tt>
SingleBallot as  <tt>ox</tt>,  but the dishonest voter agrees never to complain
about that
mispost.   The corrupt central authority counts this as three
votes for B, not (which it honestly should have been) one vote for B (in the form,
more precisely, of 2 for B and 1 for A).
That is, the dishonest voter effectively is permitted to submit
</P><center><tt>
   ox, ox, ox
</tt></center><p>
as her vote (which if she'd tried that directly, would have been
rejected by the checker machine).
</p><p>
The full set of SingleBallots that the corrupt election authority then
falsely claims exists remains a valid set provided the minority
of colluding cheating pro-B voters is smaller than
the set of pro-A honest voters.
</p><p>
So... it looks to me like they are right: this is a valid attack.
</p>

<h3> Various "election verifiability" criteria </h3>
<p>
KTV then point out that there are different criteria for (what they
call) "election verifiability".
Rivest &amp; Smith's protocols satisfied the criteria that
<ol><li>
 any voter can check her ballot appears correctly on the bulletin board
</li><li>
 anybody can verify the bulletin-board-posted votes total to the
officially-claimed total
</li></ol>
<p>
Those seemed good to Rivest+Smith, <i>but</I> as KTV point out
are not good enough to grant (what they call) "global"
verifiability, which means
</p><ol start="3">
<li> if the published election result is not correct, that has to be
publicly detected. [I presume this only is possible if the set of
colluding cheaters is small enough as a fraction of the population.]
</li></ol>
<p><b>Question:</b>
Is global verifiability achievable at all?
(Apparently Kuesters et al do not offer an opinion on this question?)
</p>
<h3> Is this really a bust, for practical purposes?</h3>
<p>
Frauding elections must be considered from a cost and benefit point of view.
E.g. consider the "Tweed Ring" which used election fraud to take
over New York City (and to a lesser extent New York State) during
about 1865-1872.
These fraudsters were easily and reliably able
to accomplish numerically-enormous frauds, and
the rewards for these fraudsters were tremendous.  Tweed 
diverted a large
fraction of New York City's finances into his own and his friends and
co-conspirators'
pockets, becoming one of the richest men in the country.  
(He founded his own bank in order to 
store his loot.)  Furthermore,
he was able to commit the frauds with the aid of a fairly small number of
conspirators.   The number of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed">Boss Tweed's</a>
co-conspirators is not clear and depends on definitions...
arguably there were only 8 or so key conspirators, but
also arguably perhaps as many as 1000 participated.  Tweed
eventually was jailed, escaped, but re-jailed and died in jail.
</p><p>
In the KTV attack, to shift the B-over-A margin by 2M votes, you need at least M
colluding conspirators.   That is a very small
</P><center>
VoteShift <big>/</big> #Conspirators
</center><p>
ratio (2),
compared to the Tweed ring (more like 60000).
That makes the risks much larger and
the benefits much
smaller for KTV's Fraudsters.   Furthermore, suppose even just one of KTV's
colluding cheating voters, happened to be an agent provacateur (or
just later had a
change of heart).  She tells the corrupt election authority
"I'll be happy to join in your election rigging scheme."
She submits her vote as per Kuester et al's instructions,
sends them her serial number so they can modify her vote...
and all is fine... <i>except</i> then she reneges on the deal and complains
that they altered her SingleBallot!
</p><p>
Even if she sends them her SingleBallot for verified destruction by
them, she still could keep a copy of it (thanks to digital
signatures)... which alone would suffice to prove the fraud in court!!!
</p><p>
So it seems to me, <i>yes</i>, the Kuesters collusion-attack works, <i>but</i> they
all must have total trust in each other.   If just one
collaborator actually is a double agent... then they're busted.
And, they have to worry about that risk even if there is no double agent.
</p><p>
Therefore, this attack in practice may not hurt much.
I doubt it is possible for any Tweedlike Fraud Ring to have total
trust in more than 1000
colluders, so they could shift at most 2000 votes from A to B.
That's a tiny vote-shift
in New York City, accomplished at great risk to them.  It would be able to
alter only a tiny fraction of elections, and a fraction not
predictable in advance. 
</p>
<blockquote><small>
During 1897-2011, no New York City mayor election has been decided by fewer than
50,000 votes, and only two by fewer than 250,000.
</small></blockquote><p>
 From a cost-benefit point of view this whole
fraud was not even worth trying.   The KTV attack in this setting
seems almost no threat.
On the other hand, in a vote with only 20 voters of which, say,
5 (plus the tallier) were corrupt
colluders, the KTV attack would be a serious problem.  Fortunately, most
such small high-stakes votes (e.g. corporate boards, votes on bills in Congress,
etc) are <i>not</i> secret ballot, hence for them you could get total
security by simply
publishing the list of all the (named) voters and their votes.
</p><p>
And we already knew Rivest-Smith was vulnerable to very small
vote-total-altering
frauds (the probability of detection had been thought to rise with the size of
the fraud to approach 100% exponentially, but for a tiny fraud could easily
escape detection).   So the KTV attack makes that known issue in small
elections, worse.  For large elections, the KTV attack, at least as currently formulated,
seems not really a credible threat, or anyhow a small enough threat
that even if every
large election fraudable in this way (i.e. every large election with honest
margin&lt;2000) was, in fact, frauded, it would not hurt humanity by any
detectable amount.
</p><p>
In comparison, I point out that Florida in the Bush-Gore presidential contest 2000, 
altered the vote by &asymp;30,000 or more by simply falsely
declaring/defining (before the election began)
a large number of (predominantly Democrat) voters
not to <i>be</i> voters since they were "felons."  
</p><p>
Elections in <i>small towns</i>
or small secret-ballot elections such as the conclaves electing the Catholic Pope,
seem the type most hurt by the KTV attack.

<h3> A defensive suggestion by Bruno Parga (3 Nov. 2011)</h3>

<p>
Bruno Parga writes:
</p><blockquote>
I was reading [this webpage] and
I have a doubt you might be able to answer. The key to the attack, it
seems, is this: "Dishonest Voter phones her dishonest contact at the
central authority to inform them of her SingleBallot's serial number.
The dishonest central authority uses that information to mispost her
xo SingleBallot as ox, but the dishonest voter agrees never to
complain about that mispost." Wouldn't that be made a lot harder, hard
enough for the attack never to be worth it, if every precinct published
its own ballots instead of letting a central authority do that?
</blockquote>
<p>
Bruno Parga's point is, the "dishonest contact at the central
authority" would now
need to be multiple dishonest contacts, one in each precinct the dishonest
voters are in.  That makes it harder.   In my (W.D.Smith's) opinion (pending
comments by others) this would make the KTV attack less effective for large elections 
(I've argued it already was not a useful attack on large elections, but with
Parga's defense that is even more true).  Also, individual-precinct publication
was a good idea anyhow with Rivest-Smith since it would mean that when a fraud does happen
and is detected, we get to know, with somewhat more confidence, 
<i>where</i> the fraud was happening.  (We'd already know that pretty well by
knowing which voters were the ones complaining about their receipts disagreeing with the 
votes posted on the bulletin board, but not if those complainer-voters tried hard to remain
anonymous.  With precinct-stating bulletin boards, we'd know where the fraud was happening
even with entirely-anonymous complainer-voters.)
However, unfortunately, KTV remains a good attack on
small secret ballot elections.
