<H1> France 2012 Presidential Election </H1>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, May 2013.</small></p>
<p>
In France 2012, the official winner was F.Hollande, who won both the 
first round <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> vote (10 candidates; 22 April)
and then also the 6 May runoff 
against (the previous president) N.Sarkozy
(who had placed second in that first round).
We shall see Hollande also would have won 
using 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> and
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting.
</p>

<p>
The approval tallies are from the exit poll study  (2340 voters, about 54%
of the real voters at the locations studied, participated, but some only partially),
with post-adjustment to correct for sampling biases. 
[Because the official France-wide vote counts for each candidate, and the 
official vote-counts at the polling places involved in the study, and
the claimed-official votes of most voters who participated in the study, all were <i>known</i>, 
it was possible to <i>correct</i>
for the differences between the studied sample and the whole voter population of France.]
The <a href="cahier_2013-05.pdf">study</a> (including the adjustment) was by
Antoinette Baujard,
Frederic Gavril,
Herrade Igersheim,
Jean-Francois Laslier,
and 
Isabelle Lebon.

WHO’S FAVORED BY EVALUATIVE VOTING? AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED DURING THE 2012 FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
-->

<ol>
<li>
Plurality falsely makes it appear that the losingest candidates have almost zero support.
Really, they have a substantial amount of support, about 
3-6 times larger than plurality makes
it appear.
</li><li>
Similarly, plurality made Hollande's win and Sarkozy's second-place finish both
seem more-overwhelming (versus the
other 8 candidates) than they really should have been.   
</li><li>
With approval the second-place finisher might have been any of {Sarkozy, Melenchon, Bayrou},
we cannot tell which because the differences between them are below the statistical noise
level.  With plurality, the second place finisher was clearly Sarkozy.  That 
"higher level of support" for Sarkozy was a distortion and illusion.  
</li><li>
With plurality, M. Le Pen came in 3rd and F.Bayrou 5th. 
But with approval, Le Pen and Bayrou swapped places (Le Pen 5th, Bayrou 3rd).
Le Pen was an extreme rightist candidate.
Bayrou was a centrist and indeed
appears to have been the "Condorcet winner" in the
<a href="French2007studies.html">preceding</a> (2007)
election (i.e. would have beaten any rival in a head-to-head forced-binary-choice vote).
Either Hollande or Bayrou was Condorcet winner in this 2012 election &ndash;
probably Hollande,
but we have some difficulty telling which 
because the Bayrou-Hollande pairwise contest was close
&ndash;
but it seems clear they both defeated every other rival pairwise.
<blockquote><small>
Based on a different 2012
voting <a href="Ligne2012FR.html">study</a> (by
Karine Van der Straeten, Jean-Francois Laslier, and Andre Blais), 
conducted on an internet web site created and advertised for this purpose
rather than as an exit poll (hence probably with a biased sample;  8044 "voters"),
in hypothetical head-to-head 2-man runoffs
Bayrou won against every opponent (with 53% versus Hollande, 
66% against Sarkozy, 65% against Melenchon,
and 79% against Le Pen).
However, this internet study seems to have had a <i>biased</i> sample that overestimated
Bayrou's support and underestimated Hollande's versus the exit-poll study. It
heavily overestimated Bayrou's and Melenchon's support &ndash;
and underestimated Sarkozy's by a factor&gt;3(!) &ndash;
versus the official vote count.
E.g. (as proof that this study's sample was biased pro-Bayrou)
it found Bayrou would
have placed second behind Hollande with approval voting:
Hollande=46%, Bayrou=41%, Melenchon=Sarkozy=36%, Joly=33%, LePen=23%,
Dupont-Aignan=15%, Poutou=11%, Cheminade=4% approval, total=254%,
and would have placed top using {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2} score voting or 
<a href="MedianVrange.html#GMJ">GMJ</a>.
This bias was enough that probably Bayrou's 53% "win" over Hollande pairwise, <i>really</i>
(i.e, with an unbiased sample of French voters) should have been a "loss."
That hypothesis is supported by the unbiased pairwise polls <a href="#pairwise">below</a>
which found <i>Hollande</i> was Condorcet winner and that Bayrou was <i>not</i> top using
score and GMJ voting.
Nevertheless, the internet study's biases seem small enough to make it plausible that
Bayrou probably really would have defeated every rival pairwise <i>except</i> Hollande.
That is supported  by the unbiased pairwise polls <a href="#pairwise">below</a>.
This internet study also found Hollande would have won using "instant runoff voting" (beating
Sarkozy in the final round, with Melenchon 3rd, Le Pen 4th) which is interesting
as yet another illustration of the fact that
IRV can refuse to elect a candidate (namely,
Bayrou according to the voters <i>in that study</i>)
who was both a beats-all and score-voting (and GMJ) winner, indeed IRV regarded Bayrou
as finishing far behind.

Also swapped: N.Dupont-Aignan and Ph.Poutou.

Approval also gives a less-distorted picture of support for the high-finishing
candidates. E.g. Hollande achieved almost-majority-approval (49.44% approved)
or majority-approval (&ge;61% by IPSOS's count)
which was not at all apparent from the plurality-voting results.

The typical approval ballot approved 2.57 candidates (mean), but as you can see from the above 
histogram, some ballots (465, or 20.7%) approved only one, while 8 ballots (0.36%) approved
all 10.  As you can see from the table at right, the voters for
the official 5 top candidates (yellow) tended to approve fewer (unweighted mean 2.61)
and the voters for the 5 bottom candidates tended to approve more
(unweighted mean 3.21)
options.  That suggests they had some appreciation of approval voting <i>strategy</i> &ndash;
if your favorite has little chance of winning, it makes sense to also approve more options
to increase the chance of your ballot having an impact.
</p><p>
Sarkozy and Le Pen had the "narrowest" support. 
That is, voters for them approved the fewest rivals,
and conversely (the data also shows), voters for others rarely were willing to approve them.
As the study-authors point out, approval voting tends to disfavor such narrowly-supported 
candidates (they call them "exclusive") favoring more "inclusive" candidates.  
A related and here hard-to-disentangle
 <a href="Extremism.html">effect</a> which we had discovered many years before using
"Yee diagrams," is  that approval voting
tends to favor "centrists" while plurality and instant runoff 
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">tend</a> to favor "extremists."

Their study also asked voters to vote using <i>three kinds</i> of
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> as seen in the first three rows of the table above.
Since Hollande won under all voting systems  (score, approval, and official), the main 
interest of these studies is not "who wins," but rather, insights into voter behavior 
in these systems more generally.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Most popular score is 0:</b>
This phenomenon, which I have seen many times before, was once-again observed:

<p>
<b>Spoiled and blank:</b>
A ballot could be invalid either because it was not filled out
(i.e. left blank) or because it was "spoiled" i.e.
filled out in some other way incompatible with the rules of the
voting system.  The offical tally amalgamated both of these into a single count
of spoiled-or-blank ballots, but the study counted the two failure modes separately.
</p><p>
It is quite surprising that the {-1, 0, +1} voters had a lower spoilage rate than the {0,1,2}
voters. (One might have naively expected negative signs to cause more confusion.)
However, keep in mind that the numbers of nonblank spoiled score-ballots at the three
locations were 6, 8, and 8 respectively, meaning (since these were very small numbers) that
the "noise" in these spoilage percentages is very large.  So this "conclusion"
might just be statistical noise.
</p><p>
The total blank-ballot rate
for score-voting ballots (all three kinds combined) was 3.1%,
and the spoilage rate for score-voting ballots was 0.98%.
For approval-voting ballots: blank=3.1%, spoiled=0.85%,
For the official plurality-style ballots: somewhere between 0%, 1.92%, and 5.82%
were spoiled.
The final-round ballot since simpler would be expected to have smaller spoilage rates
than in round 1; hence presumably
its <i>greater</i> spoiled+blank rates were caused by voters unsatisfied with the two candidates on
offer (versus the original 10) who intentionally left it blank.
</p><p>
<b>Voter lying:</b>
By contrasting the score-voting ballot with the official ballot, the study authors
were able to show that at least 17%?? of the voters lied on their official ballot,
i.e. voted for somebody different from their true favorite.  
They did this 
strategically to gain more impact for their vote.
(I apologize &ndash; I had difficulty translating this
part of the paper, hence the figure 17% might be wrong.)
A more precise figure was obtained by the TNS-Sofres France-wide poll 
(22 April 2012) which asked 1515 voters about "les motivations de leur vote."
It found that <b>20%</b> of voters polled <i>said</i> they'd strategically
lied in their official first round vote ("le vote utile").
This large lying rate seems a huge indictment of the plurality system.

<b>"Majority Judgment:"</b>
The professional polling agency Opinion Way conducted a 
<a href="Sondageopinionway2012FR.pdf">poll</a> using (among other things)
the median-based range-voting method sometimes called <a href="MedianVrange.html">majority judgment</a>.
There were 1000 respondents.
Each pollee was asked to rate each candidate on the 7-point scale
</p><center>
Excellent / Tres bien / Bien / Assez Bien / Passable / Insuffisant / a Rejeter
</center><p>
The bad news is that this poll occurred 6-7 April 2011, over a year before the real election 
(22 April 2012).
Therefore the candidates
were not the same set as those who actually ran...
</p><p>
The MJ winner (no tie-break needed) was (Socialist Party head) Martine Aubry.
In the actual election, Aubry did not run, but
Francois Hollande (also Socialist party) did run (beat Aubry 56-43 in a 2-person
runoff in the Socialist Party primary), and then won the Presidency.

Simply using average score gave pretty much the same election results as the more complicated
median-based MJ system <b>except</b> for Le Pen, whom MJ ranked dead last while average
claimed she finished 7th out of 12.
You can read this <a href="MedianVrange.html#unhappywithall">Anti-MJ analysis</a>
of what went wrong in this poll.
<!--
The main alleged benefit of the MJ system versus average score is its superior insensitivity
to "1-sided strategy" by the voters (e.g. voters who exaggerate the scores
for one major candidate, but <i>not</i> for his major rival).  However, in this case, 
Le Pen's higher finish with average-score was due to voters who <i>honestly</i>,
not strategically,
gave Le Pen a high score.  We know this was honest because they did so in the official plurality
election, which since Le Pen had no chance to win (finished 5th), was a wasted futile vote.
MJ ignored all these honest Le Pen supporters as "exaggerators" and thus mis-scored Le Pen as 
"last."  In fact, if there was exaggeration about Le Pen it was by voters giving
her the <i>minimum</i> score, but MJ responded to this exaggeration
(if present) <i>worse</i> than averaging!
(The problem is that while
MJ <i>often</i> handles 1-sided strategy better than average-based-range voting, <i>if</i>
the number of exaggerators plus honest-extremists
exceeds 50% then MJ completely fails while average retains a substantial
semblance of sanity.)
Jameson Quinn (acting as an MJ-proponent) however, while agreeing that
average-based-range voting behaves better <a href="BayRegDum.html">on average</a> 
than MJ if all voters are honest, points out that there are specific circumstances in which MJ 
with honest voters behaves better than average-based-range with honest voters. And he suspects
this particular Le Pen discrepancy was one of them, i.e. Quinn feels Le Pen really should have
finished last.  In view of this plus the fact that 
-->
However, Le Pen's position under average-based 
range voting seems to have
varied a great deal depending on the precise score-set used and the precise time the
poll was taken (average sometimes also ranked her last!) so those anti-MJ conclusions
may have been unjustified.

Also, Hollande was forecast to defeat Bayrou in a hypothetical head-to-head 2nd round
by <b>54-to-46%</b> by a 
Logica Business Consulting-France Televisions-Radio France-Le Monde-Le Point
poll on Sunday 22 April on a sample of 1090 people representative of the French population.
</p>
<p>
In view of these pairwise polls
I believe <b>Hollande</b> was the &quot;<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet winner</a>&quot; 
&ndash; not Bayrou &ndash; but
only with about 96% <a href="NormTble.html">confidence</a>.
<p>
<b><a href="Asset.html">Asset</a> voting:</b>
Bayrou publicly said he would vote for Hollande in the runoff.
Surely Melenchon would also have preferred Hollande over Sarkozy.
Le Pen  publicly said she would cast a <i>blank</i> vote.
In view of these plus the official plurality vote, it seems extremely likely Hollande 
would also have won with asset voting.
