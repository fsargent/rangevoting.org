<H1> The second US-Iraq War </H1>

<font size="+2">
<ul>
<li>
<font color="red">
The Iraq war was opposed by a higher and higher percentage of the American public the
longer it continued, with more saying it was "not worth it'' than saying it was, by
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/slideshow2/CBSNewsIraqPoll.html">May of 2004</a>.
</font>
</li><li>
<i>But</i>
in the 2004 presidential election, <i>both</i> Bush/Cheney(R) and Kerry/Edwards(D)
had voted <i>for</i> the war.  
(Bush started it; Kerry said shortly before the election
that "knowing what he knows 
now" he still would have.  However, Kerry and Edwards recanted <i>after</i> the election,
with Edwards writing an editorial whose opening words were
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/slideshow2/EdwardsWrong.html">I was wrong</a>.)
</li><li>
<font color="red">
The only possibly-viable genuinely anti-war candidates lost the
Democratic primary and abandoned the race.
</font>
</li><li>
Thanks to <i>two-party domination</i>, anti-war voters had nowhere to turn, and those
candidates, had no useful way to continue running.  (All the third-party presidential candidates
were against the war, but all <i>combined</i> got below 1% of the votes.)
</li><li>
<font color="red">
With <i>range voting</i>, an anti-war candidate could have run with (in view of the polls)
a real chance to win, and without triggering "spoiler" voting pathologies.  
More than 2 parties could become viable.
Even without winning, still <i>genuine</i> pressure would have been
exerted on the loser's opponents to address antiwar concerns.
