<H1> The Vietnam War </H1>

<font size="+2">
<ul>
<li>
<font color="red">
Vietnam war was opposed by  higher and higher percentage of the American public the
longer it continued, with over 50% against by 1967 and about 70% by 1969.
<!--  number who said in 1968 that the Vietnam war was a mistake, a high of 54 percent. 
That grew to 61 percent by 1971, by which time it was Richard Nixon's problem. -->
</font>
</li><li>
<i>But</i>
in the 1968 presidential election, <i>both</i> Nixon(R) and Humphrey(D)
were pro-war.  The only possibly-viable candidate
with a genuinely anti-war record, Eugene McCarthy, lost the
Democratic primary and abandoned the race.
</li><li>
<font color="red">
Thanks to <i>two-party domination</i>, anti-war voters had nowhere to turn, and McCarthy
had no useful way to continue running.
</font>
</li><li>
With <i>range voting</i>, an anti-war candidate could have run with (in view of the polls)
a real chance to win, and without triggering "spoiler" voting pathologies.  
Even without winning, <i>genuine</i> presure would have been
exerted on his opponents to address antiwar concerns.
</li><li>
<font color="red">
Had the American public gotten to end the war in 1968, 
1-2 million lives would have been saved.   (Deaths after 1968 slightly exceeded deaths before 1968;
the war's total death toll was about 4 million, i.e. about 13% of Vietnam's population,
and there were a comparable number wounded.)
