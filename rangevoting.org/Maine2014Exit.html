This election was a train wreck.
The candidates were 
<b>Paul LePage</b>, unpopular Republican governor seeking re-election
(one of the least popular governors in the USA according to his approval numbers in polls);
<b>Mike Michaud</b>, Democratic congressman
with a rarely-surpassed lifetime record of 
<a href="#michhyp">hypocrisy</a>,
and 
<b>Eliot Cutler</b>, wealthy Independent lawyer whose only previous experience directly working
in government apparently had been when he'd served with the OMB &ndash;
appointed by US president J.Carter &ndash; over 30 years prior.
Cutler was initially endorsed by
(also Independent, former Maine Gov. 1994-2002 and its sitting US Senator) Angus King.
Election day was 4 November 2014.
(Cf. the preceding <a href="Maine2010gov.html">2010</a> election.)

<h3> Discussion </h3>

<p>
This is one of the most dramatic findings ever seen in
an election with  multi voting system polling data, 
and is a huge indictment of Maine's (and most of the world's) horrible
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system.
</p><ul><li>
With this official system, LePage, the worst candidate in the opinion of Maine voters, 
won by a margin of 4.9 points.
Meanwhile, Cutler, the best, lost by a mile,
coming in dead last with a tiny 8.4%
of the official vote.
</li><li>
<i>But</i>, with the superior approval, Condorcet, and score voting systems
(also Borda),
<b>complete reversal</b> &ndash;
Cutler would have been the winner, with LePage last!
LePage 
was the only majority-disapproved candidate in some polls, but
in others, Michaud joined him in that dubious status.
</li><li>
Cutler beats both Michaud and LePage pairwise by very large margins of 16 to 20 points,
and with very high statistical confidences (both over 99.99%).
</li><li>
Instant runoff (IRV) also  would have awarded it to Cutler, but less surely and
now with Michaud (not LePage) usually in last place.
Specifically, IRV under a bootstrap statistics multiple reweight &amp; resimulation
of our poll data trying to correctly understand the effects of sampling errors,
finds Cutler winning in 91.4% of simulations, Michaud in 6.3%,
and LePage in 2.2%.   
(According to IRV Michaud is last 91.4% of the time, but Cutler the remaining 8.6%.)
One of the known defects of the IRV system is that it is
comparatively vulnerable to tied and near-tied elections (since a tie could happen in
each "round") which lead to "chad counting nightmares."   That nightmare
evidently is exactly what happened in about 20% of our simulations.
</li><li>
In contrast, the bootstrap simulations found Cutler won 99.7% of
the time using approval voting, i.e, in our poll in this election,
approval voting did <i>not</i>
suffer from uncertainty.
In other words 
Cutler's approval-win was a 99.7%-confident conclusion, given understanding of the effects of
sampling and reweighting "statistical noise" (and provided our reweighting 
<a href="#rewass">assumptions</a>
valid).  Cutler also had the highest approval/disapproval ratio in the PPP pre-election 
approval-style subpoll, which is independent confirmation.
</li><li>
The pairwise wins for Cutler over both rivals were by tremendous margins and are 
very high confidence conclusions provided you accept our reweighting 
<a href="#rewass">assumptions</a>.  Cutler's pairwise win over LePage also was confirmed
by several (and all) other polls besides ours, again with high margins and confidence,
and therefore is indisputable.
But Cutler's pairwise win over Michaud unfortunately was a question not directly 
addressed by any poll besides ours and thus could be legitimately doubted by those not accepting
our reweighting assumptions.  However since the C&gt;M pairwise win was by an even
greater margin and with even greater confidence than the C&gt;L win, and since it seems
(at least naively) less vulnerable to issues related to our reweighting than the 
C&gt;L conclusion, I'd recommend accepting it.
</li></ul>
<p>
Voting reformers: rejoice.  
Citizens of Maine: not so much.
You will pay.
</p>

<h3> And the best voting systems are... </h3>

<p>
In this election, 
</p><ul><li>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score</a>, 
its median-based 
<a href="MedianVrange.html">MJ</a> variants, and 
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> performed the best;
</li><li>
Instant Runoff (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>) was intermediate;
</li><li>
and the official <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> system was the worst.
</li></ul>

<a name="spoilsec"></a>
<h3> Who are you calling a "spoiler"? </h3>

<p>
Detractors (mainly Michaud supporters) loudly fretted that Cutler was a "spoiler,"
a claim repeated by the media.
But this claim was incorrect, in view of 
Maine's Official Totals plus these pre-election poll results (asked only
of Cutler supporters):
</p><pre>
If Cutler were out, then his supporters would break
   45.8% Michaud,   18.6%  LePage   (A)
   64%   Michaud,   27%    LePage   (B)
   53%   Michaud,   32%    LePage   (C)
   53%   Michaud,   24%    LePage   (D, inferred from Q1 &amp; Q2)
   50%   Michaud,   31%    LePage   (E, inferred from Q2 &amp; Q3)
   46%   Michaud,   31%    LePage   (F, inferred from Q2 &amp; Q3)
A: PanAtlantic/SMS 15-21 October 2014. (See <a href="#polltab">poll table</a> at end.)
B: UNH survey center, 15-21 october.
C: PPP 8-9 September 2014.
D: PPP 22-23 October 2014.
E: Bangor Daily News/Ipsos 6-12 October.
F: Bangor Daily News/Ipsos 23-29 October.
</pre><p>
No matter which of these polls we choose, 
<!-- even polls A &amp; B and even if we are allowed to ignore the undecideds, -->
we conclude that if Cutler had dropped
out of the race, his 8.4% of the voters, even if they broke 75-25 for Michaud
(more severely than any poll indicated), still would not have helped Michaud enough to
overcome LePage's 4.9 percentage-point lead.
(This conclusion
actually contradicts the pairwise-poll average which was 51-49 for LePage over Michaud,
but the present calculation,
since 92% based on the Official Totals, trumps them for accuracy.)
So <b>Cutler was <i>not</i> a spoiler!</b>
</p><p>
But, ironically enough, <b>Michaud <i>was</i> a spoiler.</b>
That is because, if Michaud had dropped out, then pairwise polls unanimously show
Cutler would have defeated LePage, and by an enormous estimated 58-42 margin.
And the vast majority of Michaud's supporters are known to have preferred Cutler over LePage,
and hence "should" have preferred that Michaud drop out of the race.
</p><p>
What makes this even crazier it that the <b>same thing happened in 
the preceding <a href="Maine2010gov.html">2010</a> election</b> &ndash;
Cutler then also was <i>not</i> a spoiler, but the Democrat Libby Mitchell was.
Cutler got robbed two elections in a row by plurality voting system pathologies!
</p><p>
There also is a sense in which 
<b>LePage was a spoiler.</b>
Namely, if LePage had dropped out, then instead of Michaud's 43.3% official total dwarfing
Cutler's 8.4%, in fact pairwise data indicates Cutler would then have defeated Michaud 60-40.
</p><p>
So the media had it exactly wrong.  But that does help explain why 
voters were so afraid to vote Cutler in the official election.
There was an
<b>enormous amount of strategic/dishonest official voting</b> in this election.
Why we know that: just compare the "IRV round one" election
(presumably a comparatively honest kind of plurality voting) 
versus the official plurality vote totals.  What a difference!
And: just over one-third of Michaud voters in our exit poll <i>admitted </i>
(in the sense that their IRV rank-order sub-ballot said so) they really preferred Cutler;
and just over one-fifth of our LePage voters did the same.
The reason the voters were so dishonest obviously was strategic &ndash; they did not
want to "waste their vote" on Cutler since they believed Cutler's winning chances were too tiny.
That is a known major defect of the 
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> system &ndash; "vote splitting" and "spoiler" fears
motivate massively intentionally-dishonest voting, which in this case shafted Cutler.
Another defect of plurality which also is highlit by this election,
is that it forces voters to express essentially the <i>least</i> amount
of information they possibly could, about the candidates.  A voter who likes two
candidates, has no way to say so.
</p><pre>
<b>Poll questions asking pollees for their predictions of who would win:</b>
       50% LePage,  34% Michaud,  2% Cutler.    (A)
       47% LePage,  33% Michaud,  5% Cutler.    (B)
A: UNH survey center, 15-21 october.  (See <a href="#polltab">poll table</a> at end.)
B: Bangor Daily News/Ipsos 23-29 Oct.
</pre><p>
In contrast score and approval voting are immune to (do not exhibit) "vote splitting"
and votes are not "wasted."
</p>

<h3> Crazy developments in this race </h3>

<p>
<b>Cutler</b> was endorsed by Senator &amp; former Governor, Angus King (Independent). 
But on 28 October Cutler announced that his supporters should feel free to vote
for LePage or Michaud (i.e. their 2nd choice) instead of for him (Cutler) 
to try to avoid a "spoiler" scenario.  Which then evidently happened in great numbers.
As usual, left unmentioned, both
by Cutler and by the media, was the idea that with a better voting system, 
such crazy dishonest voting behavior would become unnecessary.   Indeed, TV 
journalist Rachel Maddow complained extensively that she "didn't understand" 
what Cutler was saying.  His statement was perfectly clear to me.  Here, let me quote
it, so you can see if you can understand it:
</p><blockquote>
  [From story "Cutler won't quit, but says supporters who think he can't win 
  should pick LePage or Michaud," Portland Press Herald, 30 Oct 2014] &nbsp;&nbsp;
   "I truly believe in democracy and the ultimate authority of voters to vote for 
   whomever they want for whatever reason, and I don't think any voter, whether a 
   supporter of mine or not, now needs or ever has needed my permission or my blessing 
   to vote for one of my opponents.  Nevertheless, I want to reiterate what I said six 
   months ago: Anyone who has supported me, but who now worries that I cannot win and is 
   thereby compelled by their fears or by their conscience to vote instead for Mr. LePage 
   or Mr. Michaud, should do so."
</blockquote></p>
Cutler also said to the Bangor Daily News [29 Oct 2014 "Cutler says victory 
is 'long shot,' tells supporters to vote accordingly"]
</P><blockquote>
  If you don't think that I can win, and you want to vote strategically, do that.
   But I'd be grateful for your support.
</blockquote><p>
But all that still was not clear to Maddow, as she repeatedly said.
Apparently Maddow was unsatisfied with Cutler's statement because he did 
not officially withdraw from the race in order to <i>force</i> his voters to desert him, 
whether they wanted to or not.   Apparently only that would have satisfied her.
</p><p>
And she actually had the 
utter gall to suggest that by not actually withdrawing from the race, Cutler was 
committing some sort of sin or suffering from some kind of mental problem.
But, again as usual, Maddow in her piece on this said not a single word about how the
real problem was the voting system, nor that better voting systems exist which do not
have the vote-splitting problem.
</p><p>
  Angus King then (later on the same day,
October 28) duly followed Cutler's advice and indeed publicly
withdrew his endorsement of Cutler, switching it to Michaud.  Which didn't work,
since as we've seen, Cutler was not actually a spoiler; Michaud was the spoiler.
</p><a name="michhyp"></a><p>
<b>Michaud</b> would have been the first openly-gay US state governor if elected, albeit
he'd kept his homosexuality secret for 30 years and had (while a statehouse
legislator) voted against gay rights / anti-discrimination bills at least 18 times.
That made him, according to his voting record, one of the top 5 
most anti-gay legislators in Maine (LePage also was anti-gay) &ndash; 
in contrast to Cutler (who would seem
to be heterosexual, considering his wife and several children) who in the past had
strongly vocally and monetarily supported gay rights!  
</p><p>
    Explaining this to a reporter shortly before
the 2014 election, Michaud said "I could make excuses but I won't.
I regret some of my earlier votes and feel fortunate that friends and constituents
continued to talk with me and share their stories so that I could gain a greater
understanding of the issue."   
</p><p>
Cutler responded "I find it unforgivable.
It is inconceivable to me how someone could have voted no to equality
unless they put crass politics above principle. And that happened every time.
I would never vote for him."
</p><p>
Michaud replied: "It's easy to say one thing, but [Cutler] has never had a history
or a record... never ran for office [before]."
(Which actually was false. Cutler had also run for the Maine governorship in the
preceding <a href="Maine2010gov.html">2010</a> election, finishing 
a fairly close second behind LePage, actually closer by a factor of 2
than Michaud's own second-place finish in this 2014 election.)
</p><p>
Cutler: "Oh, please.  Many others who represented more conservative districts 
found that it was possible to vote yes."
</p><p>
Michaud also had opposed gun control and abortion rights, yet 
for the 2014 race got the endorsement of Planned Parenthood after
he declared after he made it to the US Congress: "My views on abortion have evolved."
Michaud also supported ENDA (Employment Non-Discrimination Act)
once in congress, contrary to all his earlier votes.
</p><p>
<b>LePage</b>, during the lead-up to his 2014 re-election, made a fool of himself 
on nationwide news by trying
to place Maine nurse Kaci Hickox in a 21-day quarantine
because she'd been volunteering to help Ebola
patients in Africa.  Hickox had tested negative for Ebola and it was known that 
Ebola victims were not contagious unless showing symptoms (i.e. quite sick).
But she was perfectly healthy.
The courts overruled attempts by LePage and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to
quarantine Hickox.   This would seem to win LePage
the "fomenting unreasoning fear and imprisoning heroines as primary 'leadership' method"
award.

<h3> Criticism related to the rather massive correction/reweighting needed for our exit poll </h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, the CES exit poll was conducted in geographic 
locations (<a href="MaineMap2014.png">map</a>)
that were almost pessimally chosen, resulting in a poor Maine-wide sample.  
We corrected this sample-bias via an unfortunately-large post-correction we'll explain.
</p><p>
<b>Our 4 polling locations</b> were in 
Portland (pop. 66318), Cape Elizabeth (pop. 9015),  South Portland (pop. 25002),  
and Rockland (pop. 7297).
The first three are in Cumberland County (Portland is
the Cumberland County seat and Maine's largest city; South Portland is Maine's 4th largest) 
while Rockland is the seat of Knox County. All 4 lie in Southeast Maine.
Michaud and Cutler were strongest in the South &amp; North of Maine while LePage's strength 
lay in a wide belt in the mid-latitudes.
Knox and Cumberland were the only two counties which Michaud officially
won; LePage won all the others. 
And Cape Elizabeth was Cutler's home town.
</p><p>
In our defense, <i>all</i> of the largest towns in Maine, namely
Portland,
Bangor,
Bar Harbor,
Kennebunkport,
and the capital Augusta,
are in the comparatively pro-Michaud southern part of the state.
We'd have had to travel to some comparatively remote places such as Greenville or 
Alexander to reach LePage strongholds.
</p><p>
<b>The correction procedure</b> we adopted was to assume/pretend that Maine voters consisted of
3 sub-populations, namely the Cutler, LePage, and Michaud voters.
Each <a href="MaineExitPollBallotImg.png">ballot</a>
in the CES poll consisted of 3 sub-ballots:
</p><ol type="A"><li>
asking who they officially voted for,
</li><li>
Approval-voting (approve or disapprove each of the 3 candidates)
</li><li>
Rank-order (Instant Runoff); rank the 3 in order from best to worst.
</li></ol>
<p>
The correction was simply to reweight the ballots according to whatever it said in sub-ballot (A).
The three weights were chosen so that the reweighted ballot set would exactly match the 3
official totals.
A fine point: this was complicated by the facts that 
</p><ul><li>
Two of the 696 pollees 
actually submitted an illegal Michaud+Cutler <i>double vote</i> on sub-ballot A.
For reweighting purposes these were treated as being weighted with the average 
of the Michaud &amp; Cutler weights.
</li><li>
Five of the 696
pollees refused to tell us who they officially voted for.
For reweighting purposes these were treated as weighted with the average 
of all three weights.
</li></ul>
<p>
As a consequence of these fine points, the reweighted ballot set yields plurality
totals, when these 7 illegal/unusable 
A-subballots are left uncounted, which actually do not perfectly match the official plurality
vote percentages: <!--, although all the relative errors were below 1 part in 98-->
</p><pre>
             Official   Our Reweighted Ballots (if scaled so &sum;=100)
   Cutler      8.43       8.26
   LePage     48.23      48.05
   Michaud    43.34      43.68
</pre><p>
We also considered <i>discarding</i> those 7 bad ballots,
in which case our reweighted ballot set really would yield an exact match; 
but the results of our analysis
remain almost unaltered if we use that alternate reweighting, so we'll only discuss
my main reweighting from here on.  Also, note that the reweighting we chose is more "conservative"
in the sense that it "hurts Cutler," thus the conclusion according to our poll
that Cutler still wins, is "safe" i.e. cannot be attributed to this choice.
The weights then were:
</p><center>
Cutler=0.101946, &nbsp;&nbsp;
LePage=0.479112, &nbsp;&nbsp;
Michaud=0.084542, &nbsp;&nbsp;
<small>Refuse=0.221867, &nbsp;&nbsp;
DoubleVote(C&amp;M)=0.093244</small>.
</center><p>
In other words, if a ballot's A-subvote was for Cutler, then
that whole ballot got weighted by 0.10195.
Note that the largest weight 0.47911 is <b>5.67 times</b> the smallest 0.08454.
</p><p>
<b>A critic</b> could, with some justification, object that the necessary reweightings were
so unequal as to cast all the results of this exit poll into doubt!
There are two underlying
reasons this critic's view could be justified:
</p><ol><li>
The reweighting introduces considerable extra "statistical sampling noise" into the poll data,
both because high-weighted ballots are rare so that our effective sample size is reduced,
and because the reweighting factors themselves are "noisy" which is a second source of extra-error.
We have a <b>good answer</b> to this objection, which is that we did a computer-aided
"bootstrap" statistical analysis, which of course 
knew about both these kinds of noise and correctly
reckoned them, and it turned out that most of our poll results still had quite high
statistical significance even after correctly-accounting for this objection (details later).
</li><li>
Perhaps the model that there are 3 voter subpopulations in Maine, is poor.
For example, maybe there really were <i>two</i> different types A &amp; B of LePage voters, 
and our poll, due to its poor geography, oversampled type A (which liked Cutler)
relative to type B (who liked Michaud, but our poll was unable to perceive them).
If so, our reweighting procedure would not have worked.  The reweighting procedure
works <i>only</i> to the extent the "three subtypes" model is a good approximation to the truth.
<b>But</b> this particular speculation seems unlikely because the middle areas of Maine our
poll failed to sample, historically have been pro-Republican, pro-Independent, and
anti-Democrat.  Therefore, if our poll erred about LePage voters of subtypes A &amp; B,
it probably did so in the other direction, i.e. Cutler would have beaten Michaud 
pairwise by an even greater margin than our poll thought.  So again, our
poll's "Cutler should've won" conclusion seems "safe."
</li></ol>
<p>
We do not have an optimal <b>answer</b> to the second criticism, but do have some further
mildly decent indirect answers.   First of all, the large pairwise victory of Cutler over LePage
is not just coming from our exit poll.  It also was found by 2 other,
independently conducted, pre-election polls by 
Bangor Daily News/Ipsos during 6-12 and 23-29 October,
as well as by the Frederick poll 16-17 September (we'll soon discuss these).
</p><p>
Regarding our even poll's
even-larger claimed pairwise victory for Cutler over Michaud,
unfortunately apparently <b>no other pollster</b> directly asked about this head-to-head contest
so we cannot get direct independent confirmation.
Nevertheless, there were other pollsters who asked questions whose answers allow us to
make <i>deductions</i> about this question.  (For instance we already saw independent
polls indicating Cutler was the approval-voting and score-voting winner.)
A poll paid for (and released to the press) by the Cutler campaign and conducted by
FrederickPolls (16-17 Sept. 2014) asked:
</p><pre>
<b>A.</b> "Which candidate for governor would be your <b>second choice?</b>"
     Cutler=54%,  Michaud=19%,   LePage=6%,   None/Won't say=22%
         which if the "Don't Know"s are ignored becomes
          Cutler=69.2%,  Michaud=24.4%,   LePage=7.7%
<b>B.</b> "In this year's election for Governor between Paul LePage, the Republican, Mike Michaud, the
 Democrat, and Eliot Cutler, an Independent &ndash; which one are you most likely to support?"
     LePage=35%,  Michaud=35%,   Cutler=19%,  Undecided=11%.
<b>C.</b> "If the election for Governor were just a choice between Paul LePage and Eliot Cutler, 
 which one would you support?" 
     Cutler=50%, LePage=40%, Undecided=10%.
</pre><p>
<b>Analysis:</b> 
Slightly perturb answer B to become L=35, M=36, C=19, U=10 (we need this perturbation to
make the following math come out exact).  
Then answer C is explained if Michaud's 36 points split 5&rarr;LePage and 31&rarr;Cutler
as second choices.  
And then answer A is explained if LePage's 35 points from answer B
split 23&rarr;Cutler.  LePage's remaining 12 points have to go 
X&rarr;Michaud and (12-X)&rarr;Undecided. We cannot tell the value of X,
but one might guess X&asymp;5 so that the Michaud:Undecided ratio is
the same within this 12, as within the whole population sample in question A.
As a result, in the Cutler-Michaud pairwise match within this Frederick poll,
Cutler necessarily gets 19+23=42 points, while Michaud gets 35+X points,
which if X=5 is 40 yielding a <b>42-40 win for Cutler over Michaud.</b>
That was not exactly a huge independent confirmation of a Cutler&gt;Michaud pairwise victory,
because
</p><pre>
     Frederick cross-examined his poll responses and claimed that 
  "Cutler is the second choice of 84% of Michaud voters and 42% of LePage voters,"
  each "far more than any party-label candidate or even 'none'."
  (I further deduce:  LePage is the second choice of 14% of Michaud voters.)
</pre><p>
That 42% figure contradicts our 23/35=66%.  It appears that the only explanation
of this contradiction is either that Frederick made a mistake, or that his voters
contradicted themselves.
</p><p>
The Bangor Daily News/Ipsos poll (6-12 Oct.) asked Likely Voters
</p><pre>
<b>A.</b> "Thinking about the upcoming general election in November of this year, 
   if the election for Governor of Maine were held today, for whom would you vote?"
         Cutler=16%,   LePage=36%,   Michaud=42%,   Don't Know, Other=6%
<b>B.</b> "If the election for Governor of Maine were held today and Eliot Cutler 
   (Independent) was not on the ballot, for whom would you vote?"
               LePage=41%,   Michaud=50%,   Undecided=9%.
<b>C.</b> "If the election for Governor of Maine were held today and Mike Michaud 
   (Democrat) was not on the ballot, for whom would you vote?"
              Cutler=49%,   LePage=38%,   Undecided=13%.
</pre><p>
<b>Analysis:</b> 
It would seem Cutler's 16 in answer A
evidently split 8&rarr;Michaud,  5&rarr;LePage, 3&rarr;Undecided to yield answer B.
And Michaud's 42 in answer A
split 33&rarr;Cutler,  2&rarr;LePage, 7&rarr;Undecided to yield answer C.
</p><p>
The second Bangor Daily News/Ipsos poll (23-29 Oct.) asked Likely Voters
</p><pre>
<b>A.</b> "If the election for Governor of Maine were held today, for whom would you vote?"
         Cutler=13%,   LePage=42%,   Michaud=42%,   Don't Know, Other=6%
<b>B.</b> "If the election for Governor of Maine were held today and Eliot Cutler 
   (Independent) was not on the ballot, for whom would you vote?"
               LePage=46%,   Michaud=48%,   Undecided=5%.
<b>C.</b> "If the election for Governor of Maine were held today and Mike Michaud 
   (Democrat) was not on the ballot, for whom would you vote?"
              Cutler=53%,   LePage=40%,   Undecided=7%.
</pre><p>
<b>Analysis:</b> 
It would seem Cutler's 13 in answer A
evidently split 6&rarr;Michaud,  4&rarr;LePage, 3&rarr;Undecided to yield answer B.
Now <i>note</i> LePage actually got <i>fewer</i> votes
with Michaud out of the race because evidently some number (at least 2) 
of LePage's 42 points of voters were
being <b>strategic/dishonest</b> in answer A, and really preferred Cutler, 
which they told Ipsos's pollster in answer C.
Assuming it was 2, then Michaud's 42 in answer A
split 38&rarr;Cutler to yield answer C.
Probably it was closer to 4, in which case
Michaud's 42 in answer A
split 40&rarr;Cutler to yield answer C.
</p><p>
In the light of all three of those other polls, the only way we can consistently explain 
the CES exit poll's claim that Cutler would have beaten Michaud
pairwise by 60-40 is by postulating that a large
fraction of the Michaud official votes were <i>strategic/dishonest</i>,
and they honestly preferred Cutler.
And in fact, that is exactly what the CES exit poll <i>does</i> claim:
just over 1/3 of its pollees who said they'd officially voted Michaud, 
<i>said</i> that vote had been dishonest and they really preferred Cutler, see below.
</p><p>
Also note: The Frederick
second-choice poll result (undecideds removed) when combined with the Official Maine Results
indicates that over 75% of
Michaud &amp; LePage voters (merged) prefer Cutler as their second choice.
That plus the fact from our exit poll that over a third of Michaud voters 
admitted they really preferred Cutler... 
also makes it difficult to imagine
Cutler losing a Cutler-Michaud head-to-head match.
Since polls are released <i>selectively</i> by campaigns this Frederick poll
has somewhat less credibility,
but as far as it goes this supports our C/M pairwise claim.
</p><p>
Our poll's reweightings about Cutler &amp; Michaud voters are quite close (ratio=1.21)
hence our poll is less questionable with respect to them alone.
Our <b>raw (unweighted) poll found:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Among our 99 LePage voters:
68 preferred C over M, 15 M over C, and 16 gave no preference.
(Incidentally, 20 of our 99 LePage voters said on their rank-order sub-ballots 
that they really preferred Cutler, i.e. their official vote had been strategic/dishonest.)
</li><li>
Among our 510 Michaud voters:
171 preferred Cutler over Michaud, i.e. said
their official Michaud vote had been dishonest/strategic.
(Also, 12 of these 510 said they preferred LePage over Cutler, 32 gave no preference, and
the remaining 466 preferred Cutler over LePage.)

</li><li>
Among our 80 Cutler voters:
1 preferred Michaud over Cutler (?!), and 1 gave no preferences, but the other 78
said they preferred Cutler as expected.
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
Sorry, this has been a bit involved.
Our claim Cutler beats LePage pairwise is indisputable since found by many polls
with high confidence.
Our claim that
Cutler beats Michaud pairwise is disputable, since only found by one poll &ndash; ours &ndash;
with no other polls directly asking this question.
However, we've got several reasons to believe our poll has not deceived on this question.
</p>

<h3> What's a "Bootstrap statistical analysis"? </h3>

<p>
Our exit poll featured 696 respondents (plus one 697th who
refused to fill out any of the three sub-ballots but did "write-in"
another candidate's name; we ignored this).
"Bootstrapping" consisted of, 100000 times, 
</p><ol><li>
Taking a random subset of only two-thirds of them (which is 464),
</li><li>
Finding the reweighting factors causing that 464 to agree with the three
official plurality-totals,
</li><li>
and then, using the resulting set of 464 weighted ballots, performing
pairwise, IRV, and Approval voting elections.
</li></ol>
<p>
(<a href="PuzzBootstrap.html">Why</a> we chose 2/3 as the fractional subset size.)
The point was this allowed us to assess the effect of statistical "noise"
and to attach a numerical <b>confidence</b> to any conclusion from our poll
(subject to belief in the reweighting assumptions).
For example, the conclusion "Michaud beats LePage pairwise" is not at all
significant &ndash; the opposite happens in 33% of the simulations.
<!-- L beats M:  32757;   M beats L: 67243. -->
But most of the conclusions are highly significant, such as 
"Cutler is the approval winner" (99.7%),  <!-- 91294+6238+2160+3 = 99695 -->
"Cutler beats Michaud pairwise" (100.000%),
"Cutler beats LePage pairwise" (100.000%), and hence
"Cutler is the Condorcet winner" (100.000%).
Intermediate-significance conclusions include
"Cutler is the IRV winner" (91.4%),  <!-- 91294+150+3+2 = 91449 -->
as opposed to Michaud (6.3%)  <!-- 6238+93 = 6331 -->
or LePage (2.2%);  <!-- 2160+59+1 = 2220 -->
"Michaud is the IRV <i>loser</i>" (91.4%) <!-- 91294+150+2 = 91446 -->
as opposed to Cutler (8.6%) <!-- 8551 -->
or LePage (0.003%).
</p>

<h3> Score voting polls </h3>

<p>
All of these polls used this <b>4-level scale</b>
</p><pre>
    very favorable,  somewhat favorable,  somewhat unfavorable,  very unfavorable
 which we have listed in this order and regarded for average-score computing purposes as
         3                   2                    1                    0
</pre><p>
The polls were:
</p><pre>
PanAtlantic/SMS, phone, 23-29 sept (although called the "October omnibus poll"):
 LePage     VF=28.5 SF=21.0 SU=13.0 VU=34.5  DN= 2.1  AverageScore=1.448
 Michaud    VF=22.0 SF=28.5 SU=21.5 VU=18.8  DN= 9.3  AverageScore=1.591
 Cutler     VF=13.3 SF=39.5 SU=15.8 VU=10.5  DN=21.0  AverageScore=1.703
Note LePage's 2-humped distribution, which poses a problem for "majority judgment" type 
median-based methods. Majority Judgment in this case, however, clearly awarded the win to Cutler.
</pre>
<pre>
Bangor Daily News/Ipsos, online, 6-12 october:
                VF  SF   SU  VU     average
 Mike Michaud   31  32   19  18      1.76
 Eliot Cutler   19  46   25  10      1.74
 Paul LePage    20  22   13  45      1.17
Again note LePage's 2-humped distribution which poses a problem for "majority judgment" type 
median-based methods. Majority Judgment in this case, however, clearly awarded the win to Cutler,
even though Michaud slightly ahead of Cutler on average score.
</pre>
<pre>
Bangor Daily News/Ipsos, online, 23-29 october:
           VF  SF  SU  VU  average
Cutler     15  43  28  14   1.59   
Michaud    27  28  23  22   1.60
LePage     27  18   9  46   1.26
Michaud slighly ahead of Cutler on average score, but Cutler is MJ winner.
</pre>
<p>
Michaud wins 2 and Cutler 1 of those three score polls, but Cutler wins the
super-poll got by averaging all three.
If we were to change the four score levels from (3,2,1,0) to (+2,+1,-1,-2) with zero missing,
or to (+1,+1,-1,-1) which in a sense converts score to approval voting, then either way
Cutler then would win all three score polls using average score.
There also was a fourth score-style poll (same scale) conducted by Rasmussen Reports
7-9 October online.  But I do not have their data (hidden behind paywall).

<h3> Voter Error &amp; Dishonesty Rates with different voting systems </h3>

Of 510 M voters, 42=8.2%  approved C alone.
Of  99 L voters,  5=5.05% approved C alone.
In all: 47=6.75% of the voters (unweighted raw numbers) officially voted for somebody
other than Cutler even though Cutler was the only candidate they approved.
  Type-I and type-II dishonest simultaneously:  45=6.5% of the voters
officially voted for somebody other than C even though C was simultaneously
the only candidate they approved and the candidate they top-ranked.

III. Illegal plurality ballots:
</p>
<pre>
5 undervotes or refusals to divulge;  also 2 overvotes.   
That's 0.29% overvotes  and  1.0% illegal in all (under+over).
Comparison with official figures:
2010 Maine Gov official totals:  1.3% spoilage rate (included both
under- & overvotes and all other spoilage modes).
2014 Maine Gov <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/results14-15.html">official</a> 
totals:  not announced yet as of end of Nov. 2014.  Update July 2015:

Other=79, Blank/Spoiled=5740, TotalCounted=616967=51515+294519+265114+79+5740.

<p>
IV. Illegal Approval ballots:  zero.
</p>

<p>
V. Illegal IRV ballots:
</p>
<pre>
In total in 6=0.86% of IRV ballots they tried to vote, but failed to give a valid
top-rank choice. In 5 of those 6 cases, <i>some</i> voting machines could have succeeded in
interpreting anyhow, by interpreting the 2nd-ranked or 3rd-ranked choice as "top" ranked.
But this "correction" is dangerous.

top-rank choice. 0.86%.
In 5 of these 6 cases, SOME voting machines could have succeeded in
interpreting anyhow.
-->

<p>
VI. IRV ballots where we suspect they tried to vote... in reverse order!
(But our guess about their intent might be wrong!)   In other words
these ballots were probably wholy or partly caused by voter-errors, even though
they were not "spoiled," i.e. would have been counted.
</p><pre>
For 5=0.72% of the 696 total IRV ballots, the ballot was fully legal,
but probably sometimes not what they intended, e.g. seemed to be in reverse, or
partially-reversed, order versus what would have been expected from their
official-plurality &amp; approval sub-ballots.

-->

<p>
VII.
The combined effect of the CES poll reweighting and the dishonest official voting behavior
led to the surprising output (pointed out by Mark Frohnmayer)
that the CES exit poll actually claimed LePage had
fewer approvals than official plurality votes! 
</p><pre>
How that happened:
(A)--There were 6 pollees who plurality-voted LePage but did not approve LePage,
in 5 cases apparently figuring now was their chance to honestly bullet-approve Cutler;
in the 6th case they approved nobody.

(B)--LePage despite (A) got more approvals than plurality-votes in the raw
ballot data set, due to 17 non-LePage voters approving him.   However, because the non-LePage
voters had so <i>low weight</i> in the weighted ballot set,  (A) overwhelmed (B)
resulting in LePage getting fewer weighted approvals than weighted plurality votes.
</pre>
<p><b>Conclusions:</b>
This CES exit poll supplies yet more confirmation of the 
<a href="SpoilExec.html">usual</a> finding that
under equal conditions, IRV ballots cause the greatest voter error rates (6+5=11 ballots),
plurality voting intermediate rates (2 to 7), and approval voting the lowest (0).
Our finding about "erroneous but legal" IRV ballots is probably new, since we are unaware 
of any prior multi-voting-system study where the voters tried all three 
voting systems at the same time; and in the absence
of such multi-data these errors would have been undetectable.
Obviously "order reversal" errors are very serious, at least about twice as serious as 
just discarding an IRV ballot.
</p>

<h3> Other reweighting schemes </h3>

<p>
We also considered <i>bi</i>linear ballot-reweighting schemes with weighting based <i>both</i>
on who that voter officially voted for
<i>and</i> 
on which town that ballot was from. 
I will not describe these schemes here 
because I am unsure whether they are a good idea at all.
I'll just remark that they seem to yield the same results we've claimed based on
our simpler pure-linear reweighting, only more strongly.

None of the pollsters in the above list used "robocalls," i.e. all interviews were 
human&harr;human. But the Bangor Daily News/Ipsos polls
used online methods, which are at present usually a worse (although cheaper) polling method.
Fortunately Ipsos has a lot of experience with those methods; inexperienced users of
online polling methods produce "results" truly horrible to behold.

I (Warren D. Smith) 
did the majority of the data analysis for the CES exit poll,
which was organized by
Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky
and carried out by him plus several volunteers in 4 locations in Maine.
You can get our

More careful look:
1--There were 44 pollees who plur-voted Michaud but did not
approval-vote Michaud,
in all cases apparently figuring now was their chance to honestly
bullet-approve Cutler.
There also was 1 who plur-voted Michaud & approved nobody.

2--There were  7 pollees who plur-voted LePage but did not approval-vote LePage,
in 6 cases apparently figuring now was their chance to honestly
bullet-approve Cutler;
in the 7th case they approved nobody.

3--everybody who plur-voted Cutler also approved him, except 1 who
approved nobody.

4--LePage  despite (2) got more approvals than plur-votes in the raw
ballot data set,
due to 14 non-LePage voters approving him.   However, because the non-LePage
voters had low weight in the weighted ballot set, (2) overwhelmed (4)
resulting in LePage
having fewer weighted approvals than weighted plurality votes.

CES." --Rob Richie
