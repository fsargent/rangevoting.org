Another messed-up <i>New Scientist</i> piece on voting
</H2>
<P><small>
By Warren D. Smith 2008 &amp; incorporating suggestions from others too, especially Chris Benham.

The <I>New Scientist</i> on 12 April 2008 pages 30-33

No voting system is perfect, but why do we put up with one of the
worst, asks Phil McKenna</a>.

<p>
This piece unfortunately was rife with errors and the net effect was quite a mess.
<small>
(I'd offered to McKenna to proofread his piece while pointing out the numerous errors
in <i>New Scientist</i>'s <a href="RehmeyerNS.html">previous voting article</a>, 
but he declined the offer...)
</small>
We go through them now.  Our purpose is not solely to correct/detect the errors in
the article, but also to discuss claims and views made by people quoted in the article.
Indeed,
some of the errors are not really McKenna's fault, but rather due to him too-naively falling for 
propaganda.  <small>(I'd tried to warn him that might happen...)</small>

In 1950, economist Kenneth Arrow, then a PhD student at
Columbia University in New York, seemed to prove once and for all
that it was impossible to have a method of voting that was entirely
fair (Journal of Political Economy , vol 58, p 328).

<p>
[McKenna states a different version of Arrow's theorem than is
usually stated, which appears to be based on
<a href="MaskinArrow.html">Maskin's lecture</a>.]

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
But could Arrow have overlooked better options? Warren Smith, a
former mathematics professor at Temple University in Philidelphia,
and co-founder of 
<a href="">www.rangevoting.org</a>, claims to have circumvented
Arrow's theorem with a controversial voting system called range
voting, which the theorem doesn't cover.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
That was a bit misleading because it makes it sound like Smith
invented range voting (I did not) or that I am the first to make this
"claim" (I am not &ndash; <a href="ArrowThm.html">in fact</a>
we have traced the claim back to a paper published by
also-Nobel-prize-winning economist
John C. Harsanyi
in the 1950s).
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
According to Smith, range
voting consistently yields the most satisfying result for the
greatest number of voters.

<p>
That was roughly true, but is stated imprecisely by McKenna.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Chances are you are already familiar with range voting. It is used to
rate videos on YouTube, or score entrants on Hot or Not, where users
subject photos of themselves to public scrutiny. In an election, each
voter would score candidates on a scale of 0 to 9, say, or mark them
with an X for "no opinion". Unlike plurality voting, where you have
only one vote, range voting allows you to express a view about as
many candidates as you like. And if you feel equally about two or
more candidates, you can give them the same score. When all votes are
cast, the candidate with the highest mean score wins. A variant of
the system was used in Venice in the Middle Ages to elect the city's
leaders. Over the years it fell into obscurity, but in 2000 Smith
renamed it and began promoting it again as a fairer alternative to
plurality voting.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Range voting satisfies each of Arrow's five requirements, something
no other voting system has been able to accomplish. "It's better than
plurality in every way except possibly simplicity," Smith says. "It
allows voters to express more preference about the candidates,
eliminates the problem of vote splitting, and tends to elect winners
that are more representative of the majority will."
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Smith bases these claims on a series of computer simulations in which
he tested 31 voting systems to determine which yielded the least
disagreeable result for the greatest number of voters. To gauge this
he measured "Bayesian regret", a parameter that attempts to quantify
how unhappy groups of people are following a poor outcome. The better
the voting system, the less Bayesian regret it causes. He claims the
improvement in expected human happiness when switching from plurality
to range voting would be about the same as the impact of introducing
democracy in a dictatorship.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Smith isn't the first to use Bayesian regret to compare voting
systems, but in previous models no one system consistently came out
on top. Smith says this is because they didn't include range voting,
but his study is controversial because it has not been accepted for
publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Smith claims this is because
reviewers have an irrational aversion to range voting.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
Huh?? Sorry, I do not recall making a claim that
"reviewers have an irrational aversion to range voting."
Perhaps Hillinger made such a claim.  He has a theory of that ilk.
Perhaps such a claim is true.
All I know is, I did not make that claim.
</p><p>
About the "peer reviewed" business, since you insist, a discussion follows in fine print.
<small>
I submitted my 1999-2000 paper to SC&W. It was rejected.
The referee report rejecting it (I do not have access to my copy right
now so I am going on memory)
was about 1 paragraph long.
It said it was "unprofessional" and such adjectives,
and also claimed others were in the process of having similar
thoughts to me, hence by rejecting my paper no great harm would be
done since those others would soon fill in the gap.
It did not, however, point out any specific theorem, proof,
technique, or quote that it
disagreed with, nor did it point out any specific instance of
"unprofessionalism,"
nor did it explain who those "others" were and what they were doing,
nor did studies by others come out since 2000 that do this stuff.
</p><p>
Perhaps my theorems or proofs were wrong, or perhaps I was
unprofessional (you can read
the paper and judge for yourself) &ndash;  but I know the review did
not point out any
specific example. In fact, the only specific suggestion the review
made was that I should have cited work of R.Myerson (it did not say
what work).
So I then contacted Myerson, and he told me the paper by him the
reviewer probably had in mind did not yet exist and was not yet
written (making it somewhat difficult to cite), <i>but</I> he [Myerson]
would be happy to explain it to me <i>if</i> I paid him about $1000, flew
to Oregon, and took a summer course from him. (I'm serious. I
couldn't make this stuff up.)
</p><p>
So. What was I to do?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I asked SC&W for clarification. <i>What</i> was "unprofessional"
exactly? But no clarification ever came.
</li><li>
I could argue with the referee, saying my work really was good.
Trouble with that was,
the referee, as I said, gave no specifics. So there was nothing
specific for me to argue about.
</li><li>
I could <i>guess</i> about what was "unprofessional" etc and try
to redo the paper in light of that guess, but it would be only a
guess. I would then
perhaps get back a new referee report saying the new paper also was
unprofessional,
again without explaining how or why (?) and then we could continue
iterating, each time with
me getting 1 bit of information, and each iteration taking about 1
year. A low-bandwidth process.
</li></ol>
<p>
I decided not to go with routes 2 and 3. I instead just placed it on
the world wide web.
</p><P>
Now what has happened over the years as a result of readers on the web
corresponding, etc, is a quality and quantity of feedback which
exceeded that referee report by a factor of around
100 to 1000. So, in light of that, I do not think "peer reviewing"
actually accomplished much or should be accorded much respect.
Also, Bill Poundstone based a fair fraction of his book on my
"unprofessional" paper &ndash; apparently
he somehow did not notice its unprofessionality. It's apparently
difficult to notice. I guess
Poundstone was not professional enough. (Except wait, he <i>is</i> a
professional.)

Others say his methods are unclear. "One would have to study the

<p>
My computer programs are publicly downloadable. They have
been examined and used and modified by several people I know of.
As has their raw output (also publicly downloadable).
Now <i>because</i> my work <i>is</i> based on a computer program, which is publicly
downloadable,
that is a <i>greater</i> amount of precision and clarity about exactly what it is that I did, than
is obtainable in almost all published scientific articles.  Note, computer programs
specify exactly what is done in <i>full</i> detail.  Nothing missing.  Nothing unclear.
So the claim that my methods are "unclear"  is exactly wrong.  In fact, e.g, 
they are "more clear"
or at least "more precise" than all or almost all articles Maskin ever wrote.
</p><p>
Also, even without examining my computer programs, since what they do
is mathematically defined (and stated in my paper) Maskin also could
independently write his own computer program to perform the same computation and
thus verify or deny the same result.  That (to some approximation) has also happened
(although it was not Maskin writing the new program).
</p><p>
There have been other <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a> studies by others
(which by the way <i>were</i> published
in peer-reviewed journals and/or as books) but
none of them made their computer programs public.

</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
Wrong:  Maskin did <i>not</i>
"win the 2007 Nobel prize in economics for work he did on the
rules that govern voting systems."  
Maskin in fact knows quite little
about voting systems and
has done little work on them.
</p><P>
The Nobel prize committee said Maskin got his third of the 2007 Nobel 
"for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory."
The Nobel committee continues to say
"[mechanism design theory] has helped economists identify efficient trading mechanisms, 
regulation schemes and voting procedures" which is the only mention they make of the word "voting."
Now that part may sound nice at first &ndash; and I presume was what misled McKenna &ndash;
but if you look in books about voting procedures, 
you will see few if any references to either Eric Maskin or mechanism design theory.
Maskin for example is not cited in Brams' 2008 book <i>Mathematics and Democracy</i>
nor in Nurmi's voting methods book.
I actually do not know of any way in which Maskin's work has 
managed to have a significant impact on
voting theory, and indeed I have <a href="Maskin.html">criticized</a> what little there was of it
(see also <a href="MaskinArrow.html">more criticism</a>) which Maskin work, by the way,
<i>also</i> has not
appeared in a peer-reviewed journal as of 2008.
<small>
I found it rather annoying that McKenna dwelled on my BR paper not appearing in a peer-reviewed
journal, while neglecting to mention that, as of early 2008, zero papers by Maskin
with the word "voting" or "vote" in their title have ever appeared in any peer-reviewed
scientific journal, and indeed only two
such articles by Maskin have appeared, both in magazines which seem
<i>not</i> to count as scientific journals, namely <i>Scientific American</I> and
<i>The National Tax Journal</i>. 
By mentioning this about me but not Maskin, and mentioning Maskin's Nobel and falsely
claiming it concerned voting, the net effect was to make Maskin appear to be a great
expert and me a novice.  In fact, on this topic, I believe I know more than Maskin, I
own a greater publication record (small though it may be) than Maskin, and I certainly
have made
more and larger contributions than Maskin to the field.
</small>
All of the voting systems discussed in this article, 
including the one Maskin recommends, were invented
when Maskin was a child (or before), and by others.
Therefore Maskin's work did not influence their "design," although the reverse direction
of influence might have happened.

Critics also point out that the

<p>
What does "real meaning" mean? Arrow and the <i>New Scientist</i> do not here say.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Claude Hillinger, an economist at Ludwig Maximilian University in
Munich, Germany, who has devised a similar value-based method that he
calls evaluative voting, says Arrow's exclusion is

<p>
The use of the word "more" by Hillinger seems justified.

<a name="ArrowOnRV"></a>
<blockquote>
More than half a century after publishing his landmark theorem,
Arrow, now 86 and professor emeritus at Stanford University,
maintains that voting systems based on scores rather than rankings
don't measure up. "I don't think [range voting] is a true voting
system," he says. Before publishing his theorem, Arrow and his
colleagues considered value-based systems but dismissed them. "We
felt there was no meaning to compare values between people," says
Arrow. Maskin, a former student of Arrow's, agrees. "If I say that I
prefer Clinton to Obama, the statement has meaning - I would put
Clinton in office rather than Obama. But what does it mean to assign
Clinton 7 points and Obama 4?"
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
The "meaning" of a range vote is entirely determined by its effect on
the election-winner, which in turn is determined by the rules of the
voting system.
This is definable with mathematical precision.
It is as well defined and as valid as the real numbers.
</p><p>
If you give Clinton 7, Obama 4, that has the same Clinton vs Obama
election-altering
effect (with sum-based range voting) as two voters each giving difference=1.5, or
three each with difference=1.
An example "statement" this voter is making, then, is 
"I would like
my vote to have the same Obama vs Clinton election-altering effect, as three
Clinton=3, Obama=2 voters."
Does that statement have meaning? Yes, I think so.
</p><p>
In short: If Maskin disputes range votes have meaning, he must also dispute that
"1+1=2" has meaning.
</p><p>
I presume Maskin does not dispute that 1+1=2 has meaning. Therefore,
his real objection is not that range votes lack meaning &ndash; they have
mathematically precise meaning &ndash; Maskin's <i>real</i>
objection is they don't "feel good" to his (limited) mind,
in a non-mathematical, but rather more psychological or fuzzy, sense.
</p><p>
Should we care whether Maskin's mind feels good in a fuzzy sense?
Well, far outweighing that in importance is the Bayesian Regret a
voting system causes society. Maskin
could take a Valium and feel good in a fuzzy sense, curing his
personal problem.
But if we adopt a voting system with larger Bayesian Regret, that
causes quantifiable, objectively mathematically defined, damage
to society which will certainly be in the millions-of-deaths ballpark.
So, which matters
more &ndash; millions of deaths, or Maskin's mind feeling good in a fuzzy sense?
</p><p>
Arrow's quote is slightly more defensible than Maskin's.
There actually has been this religious notion in some economist circles, that <i>utility</i> is 
not interpersonally comparable, and utilities are trapped inside people's minds and not 
externally measurable.   I do not agree with that religion.  But whether
you agree or not with it <i>does not matter</i> for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>
We are not 
comparing utilities. 
We are comparing <i>range votes</i>.
Those <i>are</i> both measurable and mathematically well defined.
</li><li>
My "Bayesian Regret" methodology, although based on utilities, 
<i>never needs to measure any utility for any human.</i>
</li></ol>
<p>
To make an analogy, any critic of Bayesian Regret methodology who 
criticizes it based on the belief that
utilities are unmeasurable, is making the same error as a
critic who says the statement "If Mary likes apples
and bananas, then Mary likes some fruit" is meaningless because whether Mary "likes" something
is unmeasurable or non-meaningful.  
The truth: <i>It does not matter</i> whether Mary liking something is measurable.
That sentence is still 100% valid.
</p>
<p>
One final point. Suppose you (a voter) are asked to choose between
these three choices:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
You get one dollar.
</li><li>
You get one dollar, and are tortured to death.
</li><li>
You're tortured to death and do not get any money.
</li></ol>
<p>
Do you feel it is "meaningless" for you to <!--have the ability to-->
express a <i>large</i> preference for  A over B, as opposed to a small preference for B over C?
(Only the bare fact you prefer A>B>C is meaningful and intensity is not?)
</p>
<p>
I do not believe you feel that way.  Also, I do not believe Maskin feels that way either.  
If Maskin
really had acted in the way that stance would imply throughout his life, not only would
he not have won a Nobel prize, he 
probably would  have been confined to a mental institution.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
<h3Ripe for manipulation </h3>
<br>
Not only are the numbers meaningless, Maskin says, but such attempts
to quantify preference give voters a strong incentive to
exaggerate. "Say I slightly prefer Clinton over Obama, but I am
concerned that Obama is surging ahead, I have every incentive to
overstate my liking of Clinton and my dislike of Obama," Maskin says.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
True... But read the article's next sentence:
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
No system is entirely safe from such manipulation,
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
And to be more precise, this sentence refers to the
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>.
Gibbard identified two probabilistic voting systems which are
strategyproof, therefore
the quoted sentence is false.  But it <i>effectively</i> is true since
Gibbard's two systems
"leave too much to chance" (in his words) to be acceptable in most uses.
Range voting satisfies weakened forms of G&S's "impossible"
strategyproofness conditions:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
In 3-or-fewer-candidate elections (and even with imperfect info),
it is always strategic to submit a vote which does not misorder
("misordering" means saying X>Y when you honestly feel Y&ge;X).
</li><li>
if N-candidate elections with perfect information, it is never
strategically-forced to misorder.
</li><li>
It is never strategically forced to score your true-favorite below top.
</li></ol>
<p>
Properties A, B, and C are enjoyed by range voting. But by the G&amp;S
theorem, every deterministic
rank-order voting system (obeying unanimity) fails to obey A and
fails to obey B.
(There <i>are</i> rank-order-based systems that obey C, but they are rare.  IRV and all Condorcet
systems fail C.)
</p><P>
So we conclude from this that range voting actually comes closer to
being strategyproof
than <i>any</i> rank-order voting system &ndash; including Maskin's and including IRV.
That fact is contrary to the
claim Range Voting is "ripe for manipulation," and had the article actually investigated
the <i>basis</i> for that sentence, then it would have recognized that.

<p>
What does "safely" and "compromising their support" mean?
I do not know. Perhaps Maskin knows, but it is not explained.

When and if this is explained, then we could try to analyse the claim.

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Political campaigner turned voting reform advocate Rob Richie is also
dismissive of range voting. "I think what Smith and the other range
voting supporters haven't grasped is campaign psychology," says
Richie, who is executive director of voting reform advocacy group
FairVote. "It's one thing to use range voting on Hot or Not or for
other internet voting when you don't have a big stake in the outcome.
But when you really care who wins, you are really trying to help your

<p>
Range voting has been tried in poll studies which you might naively
say "do not matter" but in which, actually, the voter has comparable
incentive to lie as in a "real" election that "matters."
(If you work out the numbers quantifying their incentives.)
[And, by the way, there has been a large amount of clear evidence people lie to pollsters.]
So far, every such study has found, apparently, less voter strategy
with range voting than
with plurality and IRV voting. This is true also in studies in which
the voters are instructed
to vote "as they would if this poll were the real election."
</p><P>
So to thus-dispute the latter kind of study, you'd have to postulate that
its voters strategically decided to lie in their vote about their strategies by
strategically <i>not</i> being strategic(!)
and you'd have to postulate that the reason they did that was because
they cared enough to so-lie, even though the argument was supposedly
that these voters did <i>not</i> care, because it was a poll.
</p><P>
(My mind somewhat boggles that anybody could be assuming all that...  
but the fact is, the studies so far of real voters unanimously disagree
with this worry, finding that, whether 
rationally or not, real human range voters act comparatively unstrategically.
This experimental-psychological fact is not to be sneered at, especially by those such
as Richie, Arrow, and Maskin who to my knowledge have never run such a study.)
</p><P>
Range voting has also been tried for hundreds of years in very real
very consequential elections
in Venice and Sparta &ndash; but I find it hard to draw a clear conclusion on this precise
question from that. <small> Assuming we had all the Venice data for example
(I do not, but it might be obtainable so suppose we had it) then
how exactly would we deduce from that data how strategic the voters
were and how much that mattered? Not so clear!
Indeed these concepts are not even defined, as yet.</small>
</p><P>
Range voting has also been used to e.g. pick Olympic medalists and
best-movie awards. Some of those votes are publicly available and do
"really matter."
Again, in the cases where the votes were made public,
there was plainly little strategic distortion.
I.e. name one Olympic judge ever, who range-voted in strategic style
"all 10s and 0s only."
Never existed. Almost always the Olympic judges provide similar
honest-looking scores.
</p><P>
Mind you, probably Olympic judging <i>has</i> involved strategic voting. But
very little, as a percentage.

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
In other words, the big problem Richie foresees is that candidates

<p>
But (a) neither Richie nor Maskin advocate a voting system which avoids
that problem;
(b) it does not actually matter per se if "strategic voters beat nonstrategic voters,"
what matters is the Bayesian Regret that causes;
which leads us into the theme that
(c) missing from this whole assessment (as usual) is anything 
<i>quantitative</i> saying
how often this occurs and how serious its effects are in which voting systems.
All they give is an <i>anecdote</i> or <i>intuition</i>, not a <i>measurement</i>.
When you actually do the measurements, you find out &ndash; both from polls and 
simulations &ndash; that this effect is a lot less serious
than it might naively seem.  I'll return to this theme at the end of this page.
</p>
<p>
<small>
Incidentally, the Richie/Maskin view <i>is</i> supported by the fact that
with range voting, strategic exaggeration is useful even in the 
&quot;<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p83">zero-info</a>&quot; case when
the voter has zero knowledge about what the other voters are doing and thus assumes
all their range voting scores are independent uniform random numbers.
Meanwhile, with IRV and Condorcet it is a plausible conjecture (although nobody
has ever proven it) that best strategy
for voters with zero info is to vote honestly.
However:  the zero-info model usually is unrealistic because usually anybody with enough knowledge
about the candidates to be voting at all, automatically also has knowledge about how others feel
about them.   In particular just the sole knowledge that candidate X is "a Republican"
or with "the Socialist Party" in the 
USA immediately tells you a great deal about his or her likely
election chances.

</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Smith says these effects would cancel out between the different

<p>
That is one reason. There also are <a href="StratHonMix.html">simulations</a>
indicating
that
random strategic imbalances, while they do hurt range voting's BR, do
not hurt it enough compared to how much it hurts the BR of other systems... so that
range voting still comes out with better BR.

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
For Maskin, the answer is the Condorcet method, named after 18th-

<p>
Sorry, there is <i>no such thing</i> as "the Condorcet method."
There are an infinite number of different Condorcet methods.
And I assure you that the particular method McKenna/Maskin now state, was never stated
by Condorcet.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Voters rank
each candidate in order of preference. They can give two or more
candidates the same rank, or not rank a candidate at all.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
So as a result, the vote is quite range-like in format. In an
N-candidate election, Maskin here now wants the votes to be the same
as votes got by range voting on an N-point-scale (but the votes, once
obtained, are used in a different way).  Incidentally, I have seen previous writings
by Maskin on voting, but this is the first time I have seen him advocate this sort of ballot,
and the first time, indeed, I have seen him advocate allowing rank-equalities.
Both of those probably are good developments.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
This makes

winner is the candidate who wins the most of these one-on-one
comparisons.

<p>
The above is the "Copeland voting system with draws allowed."
Maskin has written before about voting, but I never saw him previously
come out in favor of the Copeland voting system. One of Copeland's
problems is that it often yields tied winners.
</p><p>
Another problem with Copeland (which 
<a href="rangeVborda.html#clones">Borda</a> Voting also is subject to in the same way) 
is its vulnerability to 
<a href="CandCloning.html">candidate-cloning</a>.  If a faction simply runs a large
number of cloned candidates (but where there is a fairly clear quality-ordering
among the clones) that can assure it wins the election, regardless of
what the voters want.   
</p><p>
A <a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">theorem</a>
by Smith (also proven a bit later in a weaker form by Simmons)
states that 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Range voting is both cloneproof and favorite-betrayal-proof,
</li><li>
No anonymous neutral rank-order voting system enjoys both those properties.
</li></ol>
<p>
That is a way range voting is superior to every rank-order system. (Maskin's Condorcet rank-order
system fails <i>both</i> clones and favorite-betrayal,
while IRV only fails the latter.)
</p><p>
The computer simulations reported 
<a href="StratHonMix.html">here</a>
indicate that, e.g, Copeland output 10342 Condorcet Winners
in the same set of situations in which Range Voting output 11796 Condorcet
Winners.
</p><p>
That is because this test was of precisely the sort of scenario Maskin
was worried about &ndash; strategic imbalances among the voters (there was
a mix of honest and strategic voters) and due to voter dishonesty
Copeland could sometimes fail to elect Condorcet winners even though
such winners (based on honest votes) exist.
</p><p>
The interesting result was that RANGE VOTING PRODUCES MORE CONDORCET
WINNERS than Copeland.
</p><p>
<i>
Thus by Maskin's own measure of success, in exactly the sort of
situation designed to make Maskin's
worries about range voting be highly justified, Range Voting
still outperforms Maskin's favorite
voting method Copeland.
</i>
</p><p>
I would think this fact would have some impact on Maskin.
</p><p>
Also, there is a <a href="AppCW.html">simple theorem</a>
that, under reasonable assumptions about strategic voters, Range Voting
will always elect a Condorcet Winner whenever one exists.  That is precisely what
Maskin wants.  It happens precisely when Maskin thinks range voting is in trouble
(strategic voters).  By theorem.
</p><p>
Again, I would think this fact would have some impact on Maskin.

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Crucially, this means that the Condorcet winner in an

<p>
That statement is false.  Any candidate with a majority of first choice rankings
(over 50%) will always win with any Condorcet method.
Probably instead of the word "majority of" McKenna meant "plurality of" or "the most."
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
 Proponents of Condorcet say it is the fairest

<p>
This last sentence is meaningless and bogus. To the extent it
has meaning in a vague way, it is a better description of range than
Condorcet.
</p><p>
A sentence which genuinely has precise meaning is "approval voting
elects the candidate the greatest number of people approve."
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
The downside is it [Condorcet] can elect a

<p>
I do not see why that is a "downside."
Bayesian Regret enables a precise meaning to
be ascribed to otherwise meaningless pejoratives like "downside."
When you do that, you realize that
"electing a candidate that no one wanted as their first choice" can
happen with no Bayesian Regret at all. Therefore, when examined
precisely, we find this is not
necessarily a "downside."
Also, in elections where you are allowed to vote for yourself,
I find it essentially inconceivable that such a "downside" would ever
occur. Name one substantial election ever in which
<ol type="a">
<li>
candidates were allowed to vote for themselves,
</li><li>
X won (or would have with some sensible voting system), and
</li><li>
X received zero votes as first choice.
</li></ol>
I doubt one ever existed.
Therefore, this so-called downside is both not a downside, and also
irrelevant to reality. It is sad that something so unimportant and
misleading should be given such importance in the article.
</p>

Condorcet has yet to be used in any government elections, but there

<p>
The statement is false in the sense that no IRV system in use today (to my knowledge) allows
arbitrary equalities in rankings &ndash; which the article said we
were going to have with Condorcet.
(If IRV permitted equalities, then various new rules would be needed
and various difficulties and additional property-failure-problems would arise...)
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
First candidates are ranked according to how

<p>
Then what? Process continues, but article does not say so, thus incorrectly describing IRV's 
rules.. Or are
we now speaking only of 2-round runoff? (Anyway, I can tell you
that San Francisco neither used the rules here, nor standard IRV rules, despite assertion
by the article that SF used IRV. SF in fact used rules with some
similarity to these, but that is all.)

That is a downside for IRV that can lead to substantial Bayesian Regret.

those with some naive attachment to Plurality Voting.)

Australian voting expert Chris Benham provides what he thinks is the actual story, as opposed
to the feel-good propaganda pseudo-history:
"<i>I</i> understand it was brought in to lessen the chance of Labor
candidates winning due to the fact that the anti-Labor 'side' was
fielding more than one candidate in each seat."
</p>

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
Another major advantage of IRV is that it allows smaller parties to
campaign for election and present their views without the risk of
splitting the votes of larger parties. "The smaller parties have a
really strong interest in running candidates even where they can't
win the election, because they can have a strong influence on
policy," Reilly says.
</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
No supporting evidence has been offered here
to support that claim.
The truth is, third-parties can almost never win an IRV seat.
In Australian House right now, zero seats are held by third-party members.
Further, third-parties in Australia almost always get tiny
vote-fractions for
Richie's all-important "first place support."
None managed to reach 16%
in any 2007 house election, and most were a lot lower.
Therefore, if God magically killed every third party candidate in
Australia
and eliminated them from all ballots, it might well be (from
properties of IRV and the fact voting is compulsory in Australia),
the exact same winners
would have happened in e.g. every House race.
Therefore, the existence of third parties seems irrelevant
and there is no "really strong interest in running candidates even
where they can't
win the election, because they can have a strong influence on
policy."
</p><P>
I don't see how you can have a strong influence on policy by running
somebody who cannot win and who cannot alter the winner either.
Do you see how? Because I don't.
</p>
<P>
At least with plurality voting, third party candidates with tiny vote
fractions,
by running, can alter the winner, and thus have a strong influence on policy.
Only problem is that influence can have the wrong sign,
like the way Nader's 2000 run influenced policy (it could have had the
right sign if
the major candidates had granted policy concessions to Nader to pull
out, but they did not
do so).  So actually, the Reilly quote was exactly wrong &ndash; in practice IRV
actually diminishes
the effect a third party run has on policy.
</p>
<p><small>
Australian voting expert Chris Benham provides the following fascinating argument against me:
"[this argument by Smith] may be true or nearly true of recent House of Reps. general
elections.  But there was quite a long period (during the Cold War) when
it was generally accepted that a right-wing Catholic ('anti-Communist') 
split-off from the ALP, the Democratic Labour Party (DLP)
kept ALP out of power by directing their preferences 
(via their 'how-to-vote card' recommendations)
away from Labor to the conservative parties. 
If the DLP
hadn't existed, it is thought that enough of their supporters would
have voted Labor (on class grounds) for Labor to win enough seats to
form government."
<br>
<b>Smith ripostes:</b>
if Australia had been using plurality voting, then the DLP
could have recommended its supporters vote for some other anti-labor party
&ndash; or just, more straightforwardly,
recommended they vote DLP &ndash; and the result would have been as Benham described. 
Therefore,
still, I see no way in which IRV improves over plain plurality voting with respect to
incentivizing third parties to run candidates to "have a strong influence on policy" in Australia.
<br>
<b>Benham counters:</b>
(a) Not quite, since the effect of voting for DLP thus <i>denying</i> Labor a vote,
is not as powerful as <i>also</i> voting for Labor's competitor.
Incidentally at this time for this reason, Labor's policy was to oppose Instant Runoff Voting
and return to plain-plurality voting for House elections.
<br> 
(b) So why do you think the Australian third-parties keep running candidates in IRV races, then?
<br>
<b>Smith:</b>
Re (a), true. Re (b), I do not know.  Because Australia's upper house is elected via 
<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a>, Australia's third 
parties do not die out like in the USA, and hence they have enough resources to run,
if they so choose (unlike in the USA, where they usually cannot).

IRV is not without its faults. "It's not quite as vulnerable as
plurality," Maskin says, "but it doesn't rule out spoilers or the

<P>
Correct. (Albeit by "without a majority" I think Maskin probably worried, more
precisely, that IRV might fail to elect a "beats-all" Condorcet winner.)
And those pathologies have happened many times.  In San Francisco, which the
article claims uses IRV, every candidate (or almost every?) so far elected with IRV
has <a href="IrvExhaustionSF.html">failed</a> to have a majority in every case in which
they would not have won with plain plurality voting, i.e. in which IRV mattered.
In Australia's 2007 House <a href="Aus07.html">elections</a>
I found 9 cases where it appears the Condorcet 
winner existed but was not elected, and these 9 include every case where the IRV and 
plain-plurality winner differed.

I'd tried to tell McKenna that <a hrf="IRVcs.html">favorite betrayal</a> was a

<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a> &ndash; and also <i>every</I> Condorcet

<table bgcolor="#88ff88"><tr><td><blockquote>
"The problem I have with these little paradoxes is that they break
down in the real world," says Steven Hill, director of the Political
Reform Program with the New America Foundation, a political advocacy

scenario described above ever having happened in practice.

<p>
Hill's statement is false. 
The Louisiana 1991 election described in
Poundstone's book
and on this
<a href="LizVwiz.html">web page</a>
is one example.  As he well knew.
And Hill's organization FairVote got Burlingotn VT to adopt IRV, whereupon its
<a href="Burlington.html">2009</a> election featured
numerous pathologies including non-monotonicity, whereupon Burlington repealed IRV.
</p>
<p>
Hill just flat-out lied.
Further, many other "little paradoxes" with IRV have occurred, including all
the ones Maskin mentioned (see above for some links to examples), even though
the article thinks there is "no record" of them, and as we saw above, not only
did they occur, but they were very common.

But change is in the air. After casting a half-century-long shadow of

</blockquote></td></tr></table>

<p>
True. Although I don't see how that was a "softening" since Arrow
had always said this.
</p>
<h3> Two closing points </h3>
<p>
<b>1.</b>
A common thread in this article in claims by Hill, Richie, Maskin, Arrow etc is that
such and such is "not common," is "rare," or such and such is "important" or
"psychologically important" etc.
But the trouble is, those people don't provide quantitative
evidence about how rare, common, important, or psychologically important something is.
They base all those solely on their intuition (or in Hill's case, he simply lies), 
and intuition is well known to be very misleading in
the voting area.
As far as I can tell in Arrow's entire career he never tried to quantitatively assess these things
(and ditto for Maskin's career) &ndash; 
as Arrow in the above quote is (somewhat) admitting.
Now  I, unlike those others, have actually found out how important things and common are.
I have thus gone beyond mere <i>intuition</I> to enter the realm of actual <i>measurement</i>.
There are several ways to measure.  First, you can look at the actual historical record.
I have the largest available 
<a href="FunnyElections.html">database</a>
of national-level elections for this purpose, and based on it, e.g,
I estimate that plurality elections yield the "wrong winner" approximately 1 time in 8.
(Poundstone's estimate mentioned in the article was 1 time in 9.)
Second, you can do polling.
(I have collected the largest 
<a href="RangePolls.html">database</a> database of polls for that purpose.)
Third, you can do computer simulations.  I have done the largest and most complete 
available simulations.   
These simulations can assess how often named-pathologies happen, 
how often unnamed-and uninvented-pathologies happen, and how serious they are when they happen.  
All of these quantitative 
assessments were not made by Maskin, Arrow, Hill and Richie, at any level
beyond merely consulting their intuition.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b>
The whole "property based" approach to comparing voting systems was sort of started by Ken Arrow,
or at least, he's as big a figure as anyone.  But unfortunately
what I did not see mentioned here is: that approach is largely <i>obsolete</i>.
It is not utterly valueless, but since it is nonquantitative (often absurdly so) and
based on subjective judgements about the importance of this or that property, it soon
runs into a brick wall and stops dead, trapped in a permanent morass of controversy.   
Which is exactly what happened.  <i>Bayesian Regret</i>
is the quantitative approach which gets us past that quagmire.  <i>That</i>
is major progress,and this <i>New Scientist</i> piece completely missed that story
and just uselessly
regurgitated the usual he said/she said stuff that's been happening for the last 50 years.
</p><p>
I am not the only
inventor of 
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
methodology.  Several people invented and used it independently
in the voting area, and before that it was well known in other areas.  I would like
to see a recognition by the likes of Maskin, Arrow, et al, that Bayesian Regret is the right 
path forward, can escape the otherwise-permanent quagmire,
and that my Bayesian Regret measurements and findings are correct.
Sadly, so far, I see no so such recognition from either, and indeed see
no evidence either even knows what Bayesian Regret <i>is</i>.  
That is sad not merely because of my bruised ego, but because 
<a href="LivesSaved.html">millions of lives</a> are at stake.
