<H2> <a href="WinningVotes.html#DH3">DH3</a> utility calculation </H2>

<p><small> By Clay Shentrup &amp; Warren D. Smith </small></p>

<p>
Imagine that my sincere election utilities are
<center>
U<sub>A</sub>=10, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>B</sub>=2, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>C</sub>=1, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>D</sub>=0.
</center>
<br>
Suppose I believe that, if I alter my 
vote to "bury the rivals B and C" (as opposed to voting A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D honestly),
that can either
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>X.</b></dt><dd>
Have no winner-altering effect.   (The most likely possibility, by far.)
</dd>
<dt><b>Y.</b></dt><dd>
If I choose to "bury the rivals" that unfortunately might
cause D to win, whereas someone else 
(whose expected utility is [10+2+1]/3 = 13/3 = 4.3
assuming equal chances for each of {A,B,C}) 
would have otherwise won.
My utility loss in this case is <b>&ndash;4.3</b>.
</dd>
<dt><b>Z.</b></dt><dd>
If I choose to "bury the rivals" that might work and 
cause A to win, whereas someone else (whose expected utility is [2+1+0]/3 = 1
if all three among {B,C,D} are equally likely; but no matter what the likelihoods
the expected utility is at most 2)
would have otherwise won. 
My utility gain in this case is somewhere between <b>+8</b> and <b>+10</b>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The expected alteration in value for me
<i>if I choose to  bury</i>
is 
&nbsp; &ge;8&times;P(Z) - 4.3&times;P(Y). &nbsp;
If this is <i>positive</i>, then it is strategically wise for me to bury.
If P(Z) and P(Y) are approximately equal &ndash; or if I consider Z to be more likely 
than Y (or even if I consider Y more likely by a factor of 186%) &ndash;
then the correct strategy for me is
to bury the rivals.
</p>
<p>
Most people who object to  DH3 as a criticism of Condorcet voting methods, 
claim event Z is
very unlikely because it requires a lot of voters to strategize.  
<small>
(For example, if 1000 out of 2000 voters needed to strategize to make Z happen
and each one did so with
independent probability&le;33.3%, then
the likelihood of Z would be below 10<sup>-51</sup>.)
</small>
Because Z is unlikely (the objectors continue) strategizing is not worth it, so we do not
have to worry about it.
</p><p>
However, Y tends
to require even <i>more</i> voters to strategize, 
hence by their reasoning is even <i>less</i> likely.
<small>
(For example, if 1<b>1</b>00 out of 2000 voters need to strategize to make Y happen,
and each one does so with
independent probability&le;33.3%, then
the likelihood of Y would be below 10<sup>-30</sup> times the likelihood of Z!)
</small>
If so, then 8&times;P(Z) - 4.3&times;P(Y)  is positive.
Then burying will rationally happen.  Then the DH3 <a href="DH3Summ.html">pathology</a>
will happen.  Note that this happens even if the DH3-objectors were exactly correct.
Indeed, the more-correct they are that strategic Condorcet voting is unlikely, the
<i>more</i> justified it becomes for any given voter to strategize.
</p>

<h2> Let's do that again but now with A,B,C nearly equal and good, D bad: </h2>

<p>
The most severe form of the DH3 pathology supposes A,B,C are nearly equal in
utility to all voters, while D is a lot worse.   
(What we just analysed was a less-severe form
of the DH3 pathology, with numbers altered to make it less severe but more-clearly likely 
to happen.)  Let's now examine this most-severe form.
</p><P>
Imagine that my sincere election utilities are
<center>
U<sub>A</sub>=10, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>B</sub>=9, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>C</sub>=8, &nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>D</sub>=0.
</center>
Suppose I believe my burying-vote can either
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>X.</b></dt><dd>
Have no winner-altering effect.   (The most likely possibility, by far.)
</dd>
<dt><b>Y.</b></dt><dd>
If I choose to "bury the rivals" that unfortunately might
cause D to win, whereas someone else 
(whose expected utility is [10+9+8]/3 = 27/3 = 9
assuming equal chances for each of {A,B,C}) 
would have otherwise won.
My utility loss in this case is <b>&ndash;9</b>.
</dd>
<dt><b>Z.</b></dt><dd>
If I choose to "bury the rivals" that might work and 
cause A to win, whereas someone else (whose expected utility is [9+8+0]/3 = 17/3 = 5.7
if all three among {B,C,D} are equally likely; but no matter what the likelihoods
the expected utility is at most 9)
would have otherwise won. 
My utility <i>gain</i> in this case is somewhere between <b>+1</b> and <b>+10</b>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The expected alteration in value for me 
<i>got by choosing to  bury</i>
is 
&nbsp; &ge;1&times;P(Z) - 9&times;P(Y). &nbsp;
If this is <i>positive</i>, then it is strategically wise for me to bury.
If Z is viewed as lots more likely than Y 
then burial is a good idea.
(Burying is always a good idea if Z at least 9 times more likely.  
Burying is
never a good idea if  P(Y)&ge;1.25&times;P(Z).   
If 0.8&times;P(Y)&le;P(Z)&le;9&times;P(Y)
then burying <i>might</i> be a good idea.)
