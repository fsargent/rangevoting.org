<H2> How to improve the CRV web pages (or create your own) </H2>

<p>

<p>
Think one of the CRV web pages isn't as good as it could be?
Or &ndash; more dramatically &ndash; an important topic is simply not there and not even discussed?
Feel that urge to be an author singing in your blood?
</p>

<p>
<b>Easy way:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Point your browser to some page you consider not good enough.
</li>
<li>
Click "view source" in your browser's "view" menu.
</li>
<li>
Edit that source using a <i>plain text</i> editor.
</lI>
<li>
Email me the resulting <i>plain text</i> at warren.wds AT gmail.com.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<small>
Note: "plain text" means plain text. It does <i>not</i> mean "Microsoft Word" which
can store a file containing a single word of text in about 100 kilobytes (?!) and is only
readable by those who have Microsoft software.    Plain text is readable by
everybody, whether associated with Microsoft or not, and consumes only the storage it has to.
Microsoft's <tt>notepad</tt> seems to work.

</p>

<p>
<b>More details if you really want to do a great job:</b>
You can either improve an existing CRV web page, or
create your own new CRV add-on web page, as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Point your browser to some page you consider not good enough.
</li>
<li>
Click "view source" in your browser's "view" menu.
This gives you a view "underneath the hood"
of what the "source code" for the page is
(unformatted plain text) as opposed to the nice finished product 
(typeset by your browser).
</li>
<li>
Grab that plain text and copy it into a <i>plain-text</i> editor
such as "notepad".
</li>
<li>
Edit it to your heart's content.
</li>
<li>
You may want to run it through a 
<a href="http://www.spellcheck.net/">spell checker</a>
or an <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/training/weblint.html">HTML validator</a>
(here is the 
same thing but based on <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/cgi-bin/weblint.cgi/upload">file upload</a>
instead of telling it a URL).
</li>
<li>
When done, <i>email</i> the edited file to me at    <tt>warren.wds AT gmail.com</tt>
preferably with a subject line that gives me a clue what I am getting.
[Email me only <i>plain text</i> files. <i>Not</i> "Microsoft Word" files.]
If you are worried your modification
may have "broken" the page (i.e. destroyed its validity as HTML...), 
please warn me so I can look out
for that and try to fix what you broke.
</li>
<li>
I will post the improved page (unless I think you are crazy, in which case
we'll think of some way to compromise... so far [Nov 2005] I have never rejected anything)
</li>
<li>
Repeat process on new page!
[<font size="-1">
WARNING: on pages like the endorsement page which are "active" this process could
take longer because I have to keep the active programs that talk with those pages
happy.  If you want to create a new page ab initio, then grab a CRV page that looks
like the page you want to create, and edit it to transform it into the page
you create.  Please use only basic HTML not XML, and not javascript or java.
You can get HTML books on how to create web pages from the library, but for most
basic stuff you should be able to work without a book simply by emulating
the CRV pages that are already created.  For special characters in HTML see
<a href="HTML4chars.html#0">this</a>.
</font>]
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The easiest way to create new pages is to copy an old page from CRV
resembling your planned page, then just edit that copy to totally replace the content
with yours.
</p>
<p>
Also: If you have web design knowledge that exceeds ours &ndash; which wouldn't be too hard &ndash;
you could be very helpful...
you can take over key tasks for us, such as designing a money-donation feature
or an online-election feature...
