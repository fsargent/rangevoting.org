<H2> An IRV example refuting Richie's "Core support" theory </H2>

<p><small>by Clay Shentrup &amp; Warren Smith
(See also simpler <a href="CoreSuppPocket.html">pocket-sized example</a>
and 
<a href="IRVpereira.html">Pereira's example</a> where IRV does worse than plain plurality voting)
</small></p>

<p>
Rob Richie, evangelist for the Instant Runoff Voting
(<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>) movement, 
excuses the fact that IRV can fail to elect a Condorcet ("beats all") winner, 
citing scenarios where the Condorcet winner didn't have many first-place votes.  
Richie calls the first place votes "core support." 
<small>
That's somewhat arbitrary, because order tells us essentially nothing
about intensity.  
For instance, you could hate or love all 4 candidates, or love 2 and hate 2 
&ndash; and still have the same ordered preferences.  
So what's so special about first place support?  
Nothing really, but Richie believes otherwise.
</small>
</p><p>
In any case, here is an <b>anti-Richie example</b>
with 28 voters and 4 candidates where 
<ol type="a">
<li>
The Condorcet "beats-all" winner C does not win with IRV, 
</li><li>
the IRV winner M gets less "core support" than C.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  10 </td>
<td> G > C > P > M </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  3 </td>
<td> C > G > P > M </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  5</td>
<td> C > P > M > G </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  6 </td>
<td> M > P > C > G </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  4 </td>
<td> P > M > C > G </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>C</b> is the clear "Condorcet winner,"
meaning he is preferred by a landslide majority over
<i>all</i> his individual rivals.
C is preferred over G, P, and M all by an 18-10 margin.
</p><p>
But...  <b>M</b> wins this election if we use Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), 
even though he <i>also</i> has less "core support" (6 voters) than C with 8.
<br>
<b>More craziness:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>
P is preferred to M by 22 of the 28 voters, yet he's the first candidate IRV eliminates.
</li><li>
G <i>also</i> has more "core support" (10) than M's 6.
</li><li>
So M either loses pairwise to, or has 
less core support than (or both) <i>every</i> rival,
but <i>still</i> IRV elects M!
</li><li>
Indeed, M  pairwise-defeats <i>only</i> G (and by the smallest possible margin 15-13 too)
and is defeated by every other candidate (by large margins &ndash; at least 18-10).
</li><li>
Also, if G drops out, C wins.  G is effectively a spoiler.  So much
for the "no spoilers in IRV" myth.
</li><li>
Also, if C drops out, P wins.  So C is a spoiler too!
</li><li>
And if the first group of voters were to
strategically top-rank C (or bottom-rank G), then C would win, and they'd have their
second choice instead of their last choice.  So much for the myth that
with IRV, your best voting strategy is an honest ranking.
For these voters G is a "spoiler" &ndash; by voting for C these voters made their
favorite G and their
second-choice C <i>both</i> lose.  They would have been better off "betraying their favorite."
</li><li>
Similarly if the <i>middle</i> group of voters were to strategically rank C in last place, then
P would win, and they'd have their second choice instead of their third.
So for these voters, C is a "spoiler" &ndash; by voting for C these voters made their 
favorite C and their
second-choice P <i>both</i> lose.  
They too would have been better off "betraying their favorite."
</li><li>
Suppose three of the voters in the first 
group decided "To hell with this crazy election system.  We aren't going to vote."
With those 3 votes removed, C wins, which is an improvement in their view
(second instead of last choice).  These voters were better off <i>not voting</i>!
Their votes ranking M bottom <i>caused</i> M's victory!
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
It's amazing how much crazy IRV behavior occurs in this single example,
but this is by <a href="CompleteIdioticIRV.html">no means</a> the craziest.
</p>

<h3> Why does IRV do that? </h3>

<p>
In this example, 18 voters say C>M while 10 say M>C.  The reason IRV nevertheless makes M win, 
is that IRV <i>ignores</i> 10 of the C>M votes, and only looks at 
8 of them.   Those 8 are not enough to overcome the 10 M>C votes.
</p>
<p>
Also e.g, 22 voters say P>M while 6 say M>P.
The reason IRV nevertheless makes M win, 
is that IRV <i>ignores</i> 18 of the P>M votes, and only looks at 
4 of them.   Those 4 are not enough to overcome the 6 M>P votes.
</p>
<p>
It is about ignoring the preferences of some voters, while counting others.
</p>


<h3> Need more insanity? </h3>

<p>
The example above was intended to be "realistic," perhaps somewhat resembling 
the situation
in the (now evolving) 2008 US presidential race with G="Green", M=McCain, C=Edwards,
and P=Paul.  But if you are willing to drop realism and construct artificial
election scenarios, then 
<a href="IRVamp.html#bad">this</a>
demonstrates how to 
construct arbitrarily-severe election examples of this kind,
where, e.g, the IRV winner (our M)
loses pairwise to the Condorcet winner (our C) by an enormous (100:1)
margin, and also M has less core support by an enormous (100:1) margin, and also
M is ranked bottommost or second-worst by 75% of the voters, and also
M is below average in the eyes of 99.9% of the voters, and also M would
lose a head-to-head race with every opponent but one by at least a 75-25 landslide,
and also M has less core support
than that one exception by a 100:1 margin, 
and also C would beat every opponent pairwise,
and also C's pairwise victories would 
be a 75-25 or larger landslide in every case but one
(where C still wins, but not by a landslide)...
but still IRV insists on electing M!
