<H2> Examples in which best Range Voting strategy is "dishonest" approval-style </H2>

<H3> Generalities about range voting strategy </H3>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1.</b>
It is <i>never</i> strategically forced to give X less than the maximum possible score,
if X is your true favorite (or one of your true favorite) candidates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof.</b>
Increasing X's score will not change the winner (except if it changes to X).
&nbsp Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2.</b>
It is <i>never</i> strategically forced to misorder X>Y if you truly regard Y>X, in your
range vote, <i>if</i> there are 3-or-fewer candidates.
(Put another way: If you honestly feel Alice>Bob, there is never any motivation to vote 
as though Bob>Alice.)
</p>

<b>Proof.</b>

Call the three candidates X, Y, and Z.
By the preceding result we can assume wlog your favorite and most-hated candidates
are respectively  given the maximum- and minimum-allowed vote-scores.
It then is not possible for you to vote
X&gt;Y if you honestly think U<sub>Y</sub>&gt;U<sub>X</sub>.
<br>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3.</b>
If you know all the other voters' votes (or just know their totals)
then there is always a strategically best
vote for you to cast, which is "honest" in the sense
that it never misorders X>Y if you truly regard Y>X.
</p>

<b>Proof.</b>
Determine the best (in your view) candidate that your vote is capable of electing.
Suppose his name is "X."  Then vote maximum for X and every better candidate and minimum
for all candidates worse than X.
<br>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
But if there are <i>4</i> candidates, and you <i>don't</i> have complete information
about the other votes, then we shall see via either of two examples, that dishonesty
can be strategically forced.
</p>

<hr>

<H3> First example: correlation (highly ellipsoidal Gaussian) </H3>

<p>
There are two liberals L<sub>1</sub>,L<sub>2</sub> and two conservatives
C<sub>1</sub>,C<sub>2</sub> running. You are pretty sure that L<sub>1</sub>,L<sub>2</sub> will
get a near-equal number of the other people's votes, ditto for C<sub>1</sub>,C<sub>2</sub>,
but don't know whether the liberals or conservatives will be
ahead. <small>(This kind of situation can be modeled with a highly
ellipsoidal Gaussian distribution being returned by
a pre-election poll in which the correlation and covariance matrices are published, not
just the estimated means.
We admit that the sort of pre-election polls we have seen in newspapers and television never
do publish covariance information, so this is somewhat unrealistic. However, this scenario
as a whole nevertheless is tolerably realistically plausible.
For example it could arise thus: 
L<sub>1</sub> &amp; L<sub>2</sub> are regarded by all voters other than you as identical;
C<sub>1</sub> &amp; C<sub>2</sub> are regarded by all voters other than you as identical;
the country's voters are 50% liberal and 50% conservative;
rain will occur on election day, thus lowering turnout, but it is not known
whether it will rain on the liberal or conservative part of the country.)</small>
Then your best strategy is to
vote in the style
<center>
L<sub>1</sub>=1, &nbsp;L<sub>2</sub>=0, &nbsp;C<sub>1</sub>=1, &nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>=0
</center>
even if you prefer both L's over both C's (or
both C's over both L's). (We assume you slightly prefer the candidates
with smaller subscripts, i.e. your true preferences are
L<sub>1</sub>&gt;L<sub>2</sub>&gt;C<sub>1</sub>&gt;C<sub>2</sub>.)
</p>

<p>
<small>This example also can be generalized to
2N candidates falling into N ultra-correlated pairs.
It apparently originally traces to S.J.Brams.</small>
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Simpler explanation [by Damien Sullivan]</b><br>
The liberal set and the conservative set have roughly equal
chances of winning, and within each set the two candidates are expected
to have nearly equal votes.  One votes for C<sub>1</sub> to have influence in the
case of the conservatives winning, and one votes L<sub>1</sub> but not L<sub>2</sub> to have
preferred influence in the case of the liberals winning.  The
probability of vote-totals obeying
<nobr>L<sub>2</sub> &gt; C<sub>1</sub> &gt; L<sub>1</sub></nobr> is expected to be much
lower than 
for
<nobr>(L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>) &gt; (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>)</nobr> 
or <nobr>(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>) &gt; (L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>)</nobr>
because of the strong correlations.
So if 
<nobr>L<sub>2</sub> &gt; C<sub>1</sub></nobr>, 
it is highly likely that also <nobr>L<sub>1</sub> &gt; C<sub>1</sub></nobr>, 
hence the 0 vote for L<sub>2</sub>.
<br><br>
Or another way: L<sub>1</sub> is your favorite, so you naturally vote for him;
C<sub>2</sub> is your most-hated so you naturally vote against him.
It is much more likely in this case that the front-runners will be L<sub>1</sub> and
L<sub>2</sub> (so don't vote for L<sub>2</sub>, per your preference) 
or (with equal chance) C<sub>1</sub>
and C<sub>2</sub> (so vote for C<sub>1</sub>, ditto) than any other pairs.
<br><br>
The optimum vote here will bring you about twice as much utility as
more obvious/honest votes like L<sub>1</sub>=L<sub>2</sub>=C<sub>1</sub>=1,
C<sub>2</sub>=0, since you have about twice as much chance to swing
the election.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<H3> Second example: no correlations (exactly spherical Gaussian) </H3>
<p>
Let the 4 candidates be A,B,C,D.
Let the pre-election poll results say the vote totals (mean of the Gaussian) are
A=100, B=80, C=70, D=10, (well more precisely, proportional to these; the totals are these
times a number of order V) say,
so A appears most likely to win, then B, then C, then D.
We assume these 4 vote totals are samples from a spherically symmetric
4-dimensional Gaussian, i.e. with no correlations or anticorrelations
among candidates. (It is easier to make one of our examples if
correlations are assumed &ndash; as we just saw &ndash;
but our point here is they are not needed.)
There are V voters where we assume V=large (we work in this <i>limit</i>) and the
Gaussian has mean of order V and stddev of order &radic;V.
Let your true utilities be: 
<center>
U<sub>A</sub>=0, &nbsp; U<sub>B</sub>=20, &nbsp; U<sub>C</sub>=HUGE, &nbsp; U<sub>D</sub>=25.
</center>
Here HUGE denotes some sufficiently large constant. I originally had in mind
U<sub>C</sub>=70
but perhaps that was too generous (Larry Shepp once told me my problem was I
confused the word "generous" with the word "stupid") so let us leave it
unspecified.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4.</b>
The unique strategic range vote, which
maximizes your expected election-result-utility, is (A,B,C,D)=(0,1,1,0),
which is dishonest for B and D.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof sketch.</b>
The top-two pair is AB &ndash; most likely to be tied for lead &ndash; other ties are
exponentially less likely when V=large &ndash; so we give A=0 and B=1
in the vote to give us maximum chance to favorably break an AB tie.
(Since U<sub>B</sub>&gt;U<sub>A</sub>.)
</p>
<p>
Now AC is the next pair (second most likely to tie for the lead, but in the
V=large limit, it is way exponentally less likely to be AC than it is
to be AB; but AC is exponentially more likely than any other non-singleton set) so give C=1
to make C win over A in a situation where AC tied for lead and B and D's
winning chances may be neglected. (Since U<sub>C</sub>&gt;U<sub>A</sub>.)
</p>
<p>
Finally among sets involving D tied for the lead, the most likely to result in
a lead-tie is A,B,C,D 4-way near-tie near 260/4=65 each. That is because
any other location in the 4-space having D maximal has a larger sum-of-squares
distance from (100,80,70,10) and hence is exponentially less likely
in the V=large limit.
</p>
<p>
Now even if you don't believe the 4-way-near-tie business, fine.
More precisely, all I want you to believe, and all you need to believe, is it is going
to come down to either a DC, DB, or DA battle (conditioned on the assumption
that
D is involved in the lead-tie) with some fixed positive 
conditional probabilities for each,
not
necessarily 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, in the V=large limit. Call these probabilities
P<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>B</sub>, P<sub>C</sub>.
Basically what happens is as you move away from the magic
(65,65,65,65) point, but preserving the assumed fact that D=maximal:
as soon as you go a distance of order 1, i.e. order 1 vote worth,
that causes a factor of order e<sup>order1</sup> falloff in probability. Hence
when V=large there is negligible probability (conditioned on D leading or co-leading)
that we are more than a distance of order (logV)/V away from the magic 65,65,65,65 
point.
You can see that using
the formula defining the Gaussian
(which we assume is still valid out here in the tail, perhaps
somewhat unrealistically, but it is ok since we took the whole Gaussian model
as an <i>assumption</i>, and anyhow I think it would be valid <i>enough</i> even 
out here in the tail, even 
without such an assumption)
using stddev of order &radic;V and distance-to-center of order V.
That is the underlying reason for the positive 
P<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>B</sub>, P<sub>C</sub> existing.
<small>You may here worry that perhaps a <i>3-way</i> or 4-way tie could be important,
in which case the strategically best vote 
<a href="RVstrat1.html#examples">might not even be approval-style at all</a>.
However, if we agree in this example to make our spherical Gaussian have
<i>variance</i> which is a sufficiently large constant or larger, 
then the conditional probability of
a more-than-2-way tie can be made arbitrarily small, so this is not a worry.
Arbitrarily large variances arise in practice if, e.g, the votes are postulated to come in blocs
of order 1000 highly correlated votes.
Also, a different reason why the optimum vote here must be approval-style, regardless
of worries about 3-way near-ties, is given in
the second proof in the preface-part of <a href="RVstrat1.html">this</a>.
</small>
</p>
<p>
So in this final case where we assume D has a chance (which is an assumption
needed to make it worth voting about D at all)
we should vote D=0 provided that
25 = U<sub>D</sub> < P<sub>A</sub>U<sub>A</sub> + P<sub>B</sub>U<sub>B</sub> + P<sub>C</sub>U<sub>C</sub>
which by making U<sub>C</sub>=HUGE huge enough (since the values of P<sub>A</sub>,P<sub>B</sub>,P<sub>C</sub> exist
and do not depend on U<sub>A</sub>,U<sub>B</sub>,U<sub>C</sub>), always happens.
So we must vote D=0.
</p>
<p>
Q.E.D.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Sullivan-style simpler explanation:</b><br>
You vote for C because it is your favorite and you always
vote for the favorite, and vote for B because it is your preferred
front-runner and the A-B contest is most likely to matter; so far this
is just standard range/approval strategic voting.
<br><br>
If D has a chance to win,
that means the pre-election
polls were totally wrong (to allow D to get up about even with the top among
A,B,C despite predictions).   
If they were that wrong,
then we cannot trust them and need to assume
D will be about even with A, and with B, and with C, i.e. all three scenarios 
occur with roughly equal chances.  (We do not need to assume <i>exactly</I> equal chances.)
If so then what matters is the fact that D is worse than the average utility for those 3,
so you get more expected utility if you vote against D and hope for a random winner
among {A,B,C}.
<br><br>
(This "we cannot trust them" argument was intuitive rather than rigorous, but it can be made
rigorous under a certain normal-distribution model about how the pre-election polls err.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<small>I first devised this example and methodology in 1999 or 2000
albeit I did it rather badly and messily then and we
probably want to avert our eyes. -WDS
</small>
</p>

<p>
The thinking in this example actually can be generalized to provide a way to
determine your strategically optimum range-vote in <i>any</i> Gaussian-model
scenario in the V=large limit.
</p>

<p>
But Mike Ossipoff comments:
I want to re-emphasize that, although in extremely unlikely examples,
reversing a preference can be optimal in Approval, one should never vote
someone over one's favorite. One should always vote for one's favorite in
Approval or Range voting. 
No exceptions.
</p>
<p>
One author familiar with the subject said that the kind of probability
knowledge that would be needed to make preference-reversal optimal in
Approval is so rare that such situations can be disregarded.
</p>
<p>
And (WDS further comments) even with such knowledge... these situations
still are (empirically)
quite rare.  And even when they do occur they usually have a small probability of 
changing the winner, hence do not matter much.  My computer simulations with
4- and 5-candidate elections indicated an expected social-utility change due to
true-strategic voting versus "honest approval" (threshold strategy)
voting of order 1 part in 1000.
</p>

<hr>
<H3> How frequent is this? </H3>

<p>
We explain how to get one crude estimate via computer simulation (and do it).
The "naive zero info strategy" (NZIS) for range voting is, you approve the
candidates with above-average utility (using unweighted average).
Observe that this always produces a "semi-honest" vote.
</p><p>
The "moving average strategy" (MVAS), which is less-naive, is this.  There
is some pre-election perception that X&gt;Y&gt;Z&gt;... where here X,Y,Z denote
candidates and "&gt;" denotes
"has much greater chance to win than."
</p><p>
You (the voter) go through the candidates in that order X,Y,Z,...
for each one approving or disapproving depending on whether its
utility is greater or less than the average of the <i>preceding</i>
candidates (except: for the first two X,Y, you approve the better and
disapprove the worse). This can produce a vote different than 
NZIS, and which can be dishonestly misordered.  The key word here is
"preceding."
</p><p>
We now describe a simple computer simulation.  Fix a number C&ge;2 of candidates.
Generate a random voter by assigning random i.i.d. normal "personal utilities" U<sub>k</sub>
to each of the C candidates k.  Find out for what percentage of
such voters the MVAS produces a dishonestly-ordered vote &ndash; i.e.
featuring two candidates P,Q for which the voter honestly thinks 
U<sub>P</sub>&gt;U<sub>Q</sub>
but approves Q while disapproving P.
</p><p>
Here are the results.
