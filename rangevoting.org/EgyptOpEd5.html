<p>
Many saw Mohamed Morsi's overthrow
as a failure of democracy &ndash;
a duly-elected leader quickly became so unpopular as 
to prompt massive protests and military ouster.
But this actually was a predictable result of a voting system 
that isn't democratic enough. 
Voting experts like us warned that such a failure 
was likely with single-choice voting. 
A better first-round system such as <a href="">score</a>
or 
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>
could put Egyptian democracy on a sounder footing, while avoiding untold suffering and costs.
</p><p>
<b>The problem: <i>single-choice voting</i></b>, 
aka &ldquo;<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>&rdquo; (USA)
or &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; (UK).
Although widely used around the world, 
it's a horrible way to choose a leader. 
If there are more than two viable candidates, common 
interests suffer &ldquo;vote splits.&rdquo; 
The result is a &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; election where 
the winner's supporters are not a majority, just the best-organized minority. 
This system can elect the worst candidate, who
would lose one-on-one against each rival. 
Adding a runoff round improves this slightly, 
but still often merely yields two bad choices, 
and the second-worst candidate could still win.
</p><p>
<b>Fixing</b> this problem is easy. 
Simply give voters in the first round 
the right to choose whether to support or 
oppose each candidate <i>individually.</i>
Several voting systems grant this freedom to voters. 
In <a href="RangeVoting.html">Score Voting</a>, 
each voter gives a numerical <i>score</i>
in some fixed range (e.g. 0 to 9) to each candidate; 
greatest average wins. 
A score-voting ballot could look like
<a href="assets/images/EgyptSVballot.png">this</a>.
</p><p>
With only scores 0 and 1 permitted, this becomes 
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>,
where voters simply mark all candidates they approve &ndash; most approved wins. 
The only difference between approval and Egypt's 2012 system would 
be that <i>all</i> ballots would be counted, rather than discarded if they have multiple marks. 
</p><p>
<b>There's clear evidence</b> the official winner Morsi <i>and</i>
the runner-up Shafik both won via vote-splitting. 
Egyptians rejected Mubarak's regime, with 77% supporting 
his resignation versus only 13% opposed in an April 2011 poll 
by <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/subjects/hosni-mubarak/">Pew</a>. 
But the many anti-Mubarak candidates split the vote, allowing Mubarak 
appointee Ahmed Shafik to enter the runoff with just the 23.7% minority of pro-Mubarak voters. 
Secular candidates suffered another vote-split:
A May 2012 Pew poll showed 54% of Egyptians 
prefer secular Turkey as a role model (plus 7% Tunisia) versus only 32% for 
Islamist Saudi Arabia, even though the latter is richer. 
But the Islamists' greater unity put Muslim Brotherhood candidate Morsi 
into the runoff with just 24.8% support.
</p><p>
<b>Both Score and Approval voting</b>, however, would almost certainly 
have sent Amr Moussa and/or Hamdeen Sabahi to the second round, then,
barring miracles, to ultimate victory. 
A March-April 2012 Pew score-style poll which asked 
voters to evaluate each candidate individually on a 4-level scale 
{very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable}, 
found Moussa's average score was 2.27 out of 3. 
This beat all other entities including
&ldquo;the Muslim Brotherhood&rdquo; (1.94), 
A.M.M.Fotouh (1.25), 
Omar Suleiman (1.14), and 
Hosni Mubarak (0.44). 
If viewed as an approval poll, 81% of Egyptians approved Moussa at least somewhat; 
again surpassing every other entity polled &ndash;
in second place was
&ldquo;the Muslim Brotherhood&rdquo; 
(70%).
</p><p>
Approval or score voting would have allowed voters to support 
several candidates if they wanted, then finally decide in the runoff. 
A May 2012 poll by 
<a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/41592/Egypt/Politics-/AbulFotouh-dips,-Moussa-holds-steady-in-Ahram-pres.aspx">Al Ahram</a>
of hypothetical runoff races indicated that Moussa would have devastatingly 
beaten any opponent tested, overcoming&nbsp;Shafik 68-32 and Morsi 78-22. 
(This particular poll showed signs of regional bias, but even so the dramatic margin 
over Morsi exceeds Shafik's best regional results.)
</p><p>
And sure enough, Morsi, elected with under 25% of the votes in round one, 
proved unpopular. 
In one year, his job approval 
<a href="http://baseera.com.eg/baseera/pdf_poll_file_ar/PresidentApproval-12%20Months-Media-ar.pdf">collapsed</a>
from a post-election honeymoon high of 79% to 32%, culminating in his ouster. 
(A 
<a href="http://www.zogbyresearchservices.com/zrs/Zogby_Research_Services_ZRS_Home_files/Egypt%20June%202013%20FINAL.pdf">Zogby</a>
poll found 28% approval in May 2013, almost all from Al-Nour and Muslim 
Brotherhood Islamists.)
</p><p>
While the precise details of the collapse were unpredictable, 
the story of a spoiled election yielding a president with imploding approval
has happened many times. 
In France <a href="France2007.html">2007</a>, polls showed 
<!-- Fran&ccedil;ois --> Bayrou had the best approval ratings, 
greatest average scores, and would have beaten any rival head-to-head; 
yet the runoff was <!-- Nicolas --> Sarkozy 
versus <!-- S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne --> Royal. 
Sarkozy won, but his job approval soon 
<a href="http://www.sondages-en-france.fr/sondages/Popularit%C3%A9/Nicolas%20Sarkozy">plunged</a>
from a high-60s honeymoon to a record 34% low. 
And of course, George W. Bush 
<a href="RangePolls.html#GoreBushNader">won</a>
the USA presidency with a minority, then eventually departed with
 <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500160_162-4728399.html">terrible</a> job approval.
</p><p>
The Egyptian people's courage in the Arab Spring impressed the world. 
But Egypt stumbled badly in using an outdated voting system whose 
wide use only highlights its flaws. 
Now that eyes again gaze on Egypt, it has a chance to <b>lead</b> the world with elections
<i>more</i> democratic than anywhere else. 
Egypt's next president then should have the approval of a broad majority of Egyptians, 
not just a unified minority.
