<H2> Second-winner mis-identification ("1+1&ne;2") paradoxes in Utah 2019 &amp; 2021 Instant Runoff bi-elections </H2>

<p><small>by Warren Smith, Oct 2022.

<p>
As of 2022 many towns in <b>Utah</b> run elections
with "instant runoff voting," (IRV) employing rank-ordering ballots.
And in some cases Utah wants to elect two, not one, seats.
Utah's procedure for doing that (which also is what Australia would usually
do during 1919-1949 when electing 2 seats)
might be called the "<b>1+1</b>" method:
</p><ol><li>
  Elect the first seat using 1-winner IRV.
</li><li>
  Erase that winner from all rank-ordering ballots, then re-run the IRV process
  on the thus-altered ballots to elect the second winner.
</li></ol>
<p>
That differs from the more direct 2-winner IRV method proposed by <b>Seattle</b> WA
(in 8 Nov.2022's "ballot proposition 1B").
Seattle's approach was simply to eliminate the candidate top-ranked by the fewest voters,
then redo that over and over (usual IRV process)
until only two candidates remain un-eliminated &ndash; Seattle's two winners.
</p><p>
These two procedures always agree for at least one of their 2 winners.
But they can disagree about the second winner.  The question is <i>how often</i> such
"1+1&ne;2" disagreements happen.
</p><p>
Here are all the Utah bi-IRV elections during 2019-2021 
for which we were able to determine the
"1+1" and "2" winners.

<p>
The "1+1&ne;2" paradox occurs in <b>8 of these 13</b> cases.
This demonstrates that, 62% of the time,
something is wrong with either 1-winner IRV or 2-winner (Seattle style) IRV voting &ndash; or both.
