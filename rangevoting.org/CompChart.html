<H3>There are many other voting systems too...  Also there are many <I>Variant Rules</I> for these systems... </H3>
<P>Australia forces IRV voters to rank-order <I>every</I> candidate. Other 
places allow voters only to order <I>some</I> &amp; omit others (automatically 
last-ranked). Some places force voters to rank their top K choices (for some 
fixed value K, such as 2 or 3) but no more. In range-voting, "no opinion" ("X") 
scores can also be permitted; these do not affect a candidate's average (then is 
common to refuse to permit somebody to win if he has too-few genuine, i.e. 
numerical, scores).

4). IRV repeatedly deletes the candidate with fewest top-rank votes, then the 
remaining one wins. <!-- Note, when F is eliminated, there
is a tie between F and C which we assume is broken in favor of C because
all the F-voters have C as their second choice at that point, whereas the C-voters
rank F near last place.  (If 
you are morally opposed to this tie-breaking gimmick, then a 19-voter solution with
7,5,4,2,1 in the #voters column does the job.) --><BR><B>Borda:</B> 
D wins. (D's Borda score is 16+9+4+5+2=36 versus E with 12+12+6+1+3=34 and with 
lower scores for A, B, C, and F.) In the Borda system a candidate gets awarded 0 
points if ranked last, 1 if ranked second-last, 2 if... and the candidate with 
the greatest score-sum ("Borda count") wins. <BR><B>Condorcet:</B> E wins.

scores incorporated into averages.) </P>

<a name="properties"></a>
<H2>Properties voting systems may or may not have </H2>

<p>
<b>Expressiveness:</b>
The more kinds of votes you can cast, the more expressivity you have.
With plurality voting in an N-candidate election, you have N possible votes
(or N+1 if "not voting" is allowed and we count it as an additional option).
That is a lot less expressivity than approval voting with 2<sup>N</sup> possible
votes.   
With rank-order voting systems you have N!
(although in such rules-variants as <a href="IRV3.html">top-3-IRV</a> there are
much fewer
legal votes; e.g. approval voting is more expressive than top-3-IRV if there are more
than 8 or 9 candidates, such as in San Francisco's top-3-IRV mayoral election of 2002
with 12 candidates plus 6 more running as write-ins)
and with 0-99 range voting you have 100<sup>N</sup>
(or 101<sup>N</sup> if "no opinion" scores permitted for each candidate).
</p>

<p>
<b>Participation:</b>
If casting an honest vote can
never cause the election result to get worse (in that voter's view) than if she hadn't voted
at all,
then that voting system satisfies the "participation property."
(Some voting systems like Condorcet and IRV 
<a href="PuzzIrvPartic.html">fail</a> this &ndash; they exhibit "no-show paradox" 
elections
where some class of voters would have been better off "not showing up.")
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="FBCsurvey.html">Favorite-safe:</a></b>
If it never is more strategic to vote a non-favorite ahead of your favorite,
then the voting system is "favorite-safe."  
(So-called because it is "safe" to vote for your favorite.)
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="CandCloning.html">Clone-safe</a>:</b>
If a "clone" of a candidate (rated almost identical to the original by
every voter) enters or leaves the race, that should not affect the winner
(aside from possible replacement by a clone).
We call voting systems obeying this "clone-safe."  
Borda and plurality voting severely fail this property.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="Monotone.html">Monotonicity</a></b>
is the property of a voting system that
<ol type="I">
<li>
If somebody increases their vote for candidate C (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not worsen C's chances of winning the election.
</li><li>
If somebody decreases their vote for candidate B (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not improve B's chances of winning the election.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remove-loser safe:</b>
If some losing candidate X is found to be a criminal and ineligible to run, 
then the same ballots should still be usable to conduct
an election with X removed, and should still elect the same winner.
(But if X's departure changes the winner, the property fails.  
In several voting systems, e.g. Borda,
X's departure can actually <a href="scoreVborda.html#JohnsonEx">reverse</a> 
the finish-order of all the other candidates,
a <i>dramatic</i> failure.)
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="IrvNonAdd.html">Precinct-countable</a>:</b>
If each precinct can publish a succinct summary of the vote (sub)total in that precinct,
and the overall country-wide winner can be determined from those precinct subtotals,
then the voting system is "precinct-countable."   Precinct-countable 
systems allow greater election transparency to reduce risk of undetected fraud.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="VotMach.html">Dumb machines</a>:</b>
Are "dumb" (i.e. non-computerized) totalizing voting machines, designed only to support
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, usable for this voting system?
</p>

<p>
<b>Extremist/Centrist bias:</b>
Suppose the candidates are positioned along a line (1-dimensional)
or in a plane (2-dimensional) and voters prefer candidates located nearer to them.
In some voting systems, it is usually difficult or impossible for "centrists"
(centrally located relative to the other candidates) to win.
Those systems "favor extremists."
Other voting systems "favor centrists."
We apologize for defining this property rather vaguely, but in practice it is often
quite clear which category a voting system belongs in.
For example,
check <a href="IrvExtreme.html">these pictures</a> (especially "note #2")
to see that Instant Runoff (IRV) voting strongly favors extremists; more such pictures
for many other voting systems 
<a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">here</a> showing that,
e.g, plurality voting also has built in pro-extremist bias.
</p>


<p>
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">Relative <b>Enactability:</b></a>
This is judged from poll studies about voter preferences.
(Click the link for details.)
These show range voting is the most enactible 
(with 10 score-<a href="RateScaleResearch.html">levels</a> apparently most preferred),
approval voting next, plurality next, and instant runoff is the
least enactible (and most likely to be repealed) among these four.
</p><p>
Also, historically: approval, score, plurality and instant runoff all have been enacted
in various countries.  (Borda was enacted just once, but soon repealed.)
As far as we know Condorcet was never enacted and also never was put to
a referendum to <i>try</i> to be enacted. But considering it is even more complicated
than IRV its chances seem probably poor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Simplicity:</b>
Voting systems with simpler rules, simpler counting algorithms, and found to be simpler
by human voters are "simpler."
If you want to be precise about this, then we point out you can objectively measure 
the "simplicity" of the rules and vote-counting algorithm as the length of the 
shortest computer program that inputs, checks-validity-of, and counts the votes to determine 
the winner.  And you can objectively measure how simple humans find it to vote by e.g,
comparing ballot <a href="SPRates.html">spoilage rates</a> under different voting systems,
or comparing the average <a href="ManyChoices.html#hot">time</a> it takes humans to cast their vote
or for other humans (or computers) to count them, or
asking voters for their <a href="Comprehension.html">self-assessed comprehension level</a>.
The latter two actually indicate, surprisingly,
that <i>range=score voting is the <u>best</u>-comprehended</i> among
{score, approval, instant runoff} *&ndash; and perhaps even if we include plurality too!
&ndash; i.e. the situation is
better for range voting than our chart indicates.
