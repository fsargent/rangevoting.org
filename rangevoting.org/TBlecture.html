<p><b>Thesis.</b>
<br>
We argue "range voting" is the best single-winner voting method
among all commonly proposed alternatives.  Measurements &amp; estimates 
<a href="LivesSaved.html">indicate</a>
that if adopted instead of the currently most-used system, "plurality voting,"
humanity's lot would improve by an amount comparable to or exceeding the
improvement got from switching from undemocratic forms of government to
democracy.   Crude (but conservative?) estimate:
each day's delay in getting range voting
costs (in statistical sense) 5000 lives.

An 11-voter, 6-candidate election (candidates A,B,C,D,E,F)
</caption>
</table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
<b>Plurality:</b> A wins (most top-rank votes with 4).
<br>
<b>Plurality+Runoff among top two:</b> B wins over A in the runoff, 6-to-5.
<br>
<b>Instant Runoff (IRV):</b> C wins
(eliminate E, D, F, and B in that order &ndash;  doesn't matter which way you break 
DF tie &ndash; then C beats A in final round 7 to 4).
IRV repeatedly deletes the candidate with fewest
top-rank votes, then the remaining one wins.

<!-- Note, when F is eliminated, there
is a tie between F and C which we assume is broken in favor of C because
all the F-voters have C as their second choice at that point, whereas the C-voters
rank F near last place.  (If 
you are morally opposed to this tie-breaking gimmick, then a 19-voter solution with
7,5,4,2,1 in the #voters column does the job.) -->
<br>
<b>Borda:</b> D wins.   
(D's Borda score is 16+9+4+5+2=36 versus E with 12+12+6+1+3=34 and 
with lower scores for A, B, C, and F.)  In the Borda system a candidate gets awarded
0 points if ranked last, 1 if ranked second-last, 2 if...  and the candidate
with the greatest score-sum ("Borda count") wins.
<br>
<b>Condorcet:</b> E wins.  (Since E pairwise-beats each other candidate, e.g. beating
A 6:5, B 6:5, C 7:4, D 6:5, and F 9:2.)
<br>
<b><a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval</a> Voting:</b> 
If all the <font color="red">red</font> candidates are "approved," then F wins with
7 approvals (versus A=4, B=5, C=3, D=6, E=5).
</p>

<p>
And with 0-99 <b>Range Voting</b>, 
it would in fact be possible to make <i>any</i> of the 6 
candidates win,
depending on how the voters chose the scores compatibly with the orderings above.
In Range Voting each voter awards a score from 0 to 99 to each candidate;
greatest average score wins.
(<a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.org">Fancier rules</a> allow also scoring a candidate with 
X = intentional blank = "no opinion" &ndash; only numerical scores incorporated 
into averages.)

<H2>  Arrow impossibility theorem &amp; Nobel causes 50 year timewaste </H2>

<p>
K.J.Arrow's (1950) theorem states that no voting method
can satisfy following short list of conditions:
<ol>
<li>
<table cellpadding="17" align="right"><tr><td>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">

<CAPTION>B wins? Drop C then A wins</caption>
</table>
Is no dictator.</li>
<li>
If every voter prefers A to B then so does group.</li>
<li>
Relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their
relative positions in the individual rankings, but do <I>not</i> depend on the
individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C.</li>
</ol>
"This discovery was a major factor in Arrow winning the Nobel Prize in Economics."
</p>

<p>
Commonly heard: "Arrow's theorem shows that no 'best' voting system exists."
<br>
"Proof":
By Arrow, for every voting system, including the putative "best" system B,
exists an election which makes it look bad.  Construct system A which looks good in that situation.
Then A is "superior" to B so B cannot be best. Q.E.D.
</p>

<p>
<b>That all is wrong.</b>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> satisfies all three
criteria, accomplishing the "impossible"!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Huh?
</li><li>
Arrow's definition of "voting system" excludes range voting.
</li><li>
Oh.
</li><li>
True lesson of Arrow's theorem = stay away from voting systems based 
on rank-order ballots. 
</li><li>
(Reinforcement:
I have a <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper</a>
in which I construct "universal counterexamples"
which make <i>every</i> voting method based on <i>finite</i> set of
vote-types look bad [min-utility winners]
while range voting [continuum infinity of vote-types] looks
good [max-utility winner].)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bogusness.  "Property based" thinking 
misled all of political science for 50 years.
</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<a name="gibsat"></a>
<H2>  Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem </H2>

<p>
<i>No single-winner voting method exists</i>
(in which the votes are rank-order ballots)
satisfying all of the following short list of conditions:
<ol>
<li>
There is no "dictator."
</li><li>
If every voter ranks X top, then X wins the election.
</li><li>
The voting system is deterministic, i.e. its decision about who wins is
based purely on the votes, not on random chance.
</li><li>
There are at least three candidates running.
</li><li>
Honest and strategic voting are the same thing, i.e.
it never "pays for a voter to lie," i.e. (more precisely) there is no election
situation in which a voter, by submitting a dishonest vote claiming A&gt;B
when really she <!-- feels B is better than A -->
does not agree that A is a better candidate than B, 
can make the election result come out better 
(from her point of view) than
if she had voted honestly.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="extension"></a>
<b>Extension:</b>
Furthermore, even if we allow <i>non</i>deterministic voting methods in which chance
plays a role, then the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem remains true <i>except</i>
for this list of voting methods (which are the only probabilistic
rank-order voting methods satisfying all the GS criteria):
<dl>
<dt>
Random-voter:
</dt>
<dd>
Pick a vote at random and do whatever it says (ignoring all other votes).
</dd>
<dt>
Random-pair:
</dt>
<dd>
Pick two candidates (call them A and B)
at random.  Eliminate all the other candidates (both from the 
election and from all rank-order ballots).
Now elect whichever of A and B would
have won a head-to-head election using those ballots.
</dd>
<dt>
Probabilistic mixture of the preceding two:
</dt>
<dd>
Based on a dice roll, use random-voter or random-pair.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Unfortunately, these voting methods are (in Gibbard's words)
unacceptable because they "leave too much to chance."
</P>


<p>
<b>Wait a minute.</b>
Doesn't <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> (in the &le;3-candidate case)
satisfy all GS criteria,
accomplishing the "impossible"?!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
There is no dictator, that is, there exists no 
single range voter who, no matter what the other voters say, always gets the winner he
wants.
Check.
</li>
<li>
If every range voter scores X top, then X wins the election.
Check.
</li>
<li>
Range voting is deterministic, i.e. its decision about who wins is
based purely on the votes, and not on random chance.
Check.  (Although we'd have to have some pre-determined method of
breaking ties, such as alphabetically first tied candidate wins.)
</li>
<li>
Range voting has no problems handling any number of candidates whether three, more,
or fewer.   Check.
</li>
<li>
In range voting elections
with <b>3-or-fewer candidates</b>, it never pays 
to submit a dishonest vote claiming A>B
when you really feel B&ge;A.  Proof:
Score your favorite 99 and your most-hated 0.
It should be obvious that doing those two things can never hurt you.
Now, <i>no matter what score you give</i> the remaining candidate,
it can never be above 99 or below 0. Q.E.D.

<a name="howtoeval"></a>
<H2>  Four ways to (try to) seek a best voting system </H2>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>A. Look at human elections through <a href="FunnyElections.html">history</a>, 
or artificial ones (paid subjects).</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real; right sample space.
<br>
Cons[Historical]: Often hard to assess 
how "good" different election results were or would have been
and what results "would" have occurred 
had other election method X had been used instead.  
(And subjective. And you'll be accused of bias.)
Also, still not really correct sample 
space (since space might <a href="Duverger.html">change</a> over time with new X...).
<br>
Cons[Paid subjects]: 
Very expensive.  Not really real.   
<br>
Cons[Both]: Little data &rArr; low statistical significance &rArr; few results.  
And people lie to pollsters.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>B. Examine logical "properties" of the methods using artificial 
election examples / proving theorems.
</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Keeps political scientists employed.  Educational.   Insane paradoxes fun to complain about.
<br>
Cons: Some paradoxes arise rarely, some commonly.  Some usually cause serious harm,
others usually only minor damage.   
This approach offers no way to tell which.
Which properties are more important?  
That is <i>subjective</I>.  Qualitative not quantitative.
<i>Starts</i> eternal debate, not ends it.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>C. Measure "Bayesian regret" of different election methods via computer election sims.
</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Large amounts of data &rArr; statistical significance is no problem.
Artificial cyber-voters better than humans: 
Can read their  "minds" to
find their true desires unpolluted by lies 
(measured in standard "happiness units" too).
<br>
Cons: Computer results out = only as good as the assumptions &amp; models in.
Only try voting systems you try, not all possible.
<br>
Pros: 
Can try large number of assumption sets &amp; models.  If so lucky that
in <i>all</i> of them, one voting method robustly is best, convincing.
<br>
Con: If not so lucky &ndash; some methods best in this model, others best in that &rArr;
bummer.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>D. Find planet; create eusocial lifeform that needs to conduct elections
as important part of life-cycle; better decisions via the elections &rArr; more fitness;
put on planet; wait 20-200 million years; see
what voting system Darwinian evolution comes up with.</b>
</dt><dd>
Pros: Real (arguably more real than with humans).   Lots of data &rArr; high significance.
<br>
Cons: Spare planets unavailable in local drug store.
<br>
Pros: Already been done at least twice on this planet (social insects)!! <i>Hundreds of
trillions</i> of very-important-to-the-insects elections so far! <i>All</i> voting systems
considered (in some sense).
</dd>
</dl>

<hr>
<a name="bayregm"></a>
<H2>  What is Bayesian Regret? </H2>

<p>
<b>Oversimplified into nutshell:</b>
"Bayesian regret" of election method E is 
"expected avoidable human unhappiness"
caused by using E.
</p>

<p>
<b>More precise answer:</b>
Bayesian regret is gotten via this <i>procedure</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter has a personal
"utility" value for the election of each candidate.
(E.g, if Nixon elected, then Jill Voter acquires -55 extra lifetime happiness units.)
In computer simulation,  "voters" &amp; "candidates" are artificial,
and the utility numbers are generated by 
some randomized "utility generator" and assigned
artificially to each candidate-voter pair.
</li>
<li>
Now the voters vote, based both on their private utility
values, and (if strategic voters)
on their perception from "pre-election polls"
(also generated artificially within the simulation, e.g. from

alt="Barro's democracy vs GDP growth-rate plot" hspace="10" align="right"></a>

<p>
Book R.J.Barro:
<a href="RVPapers.html">Determinants of Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Empirical Study</a>
predicts growth rate of country's real GDP 
from facts about country.
GDP growth enhanced by:
<ul>
<li> 
low <i>initial</i> per capita real
GDP  (then tech transfer causes fast growth; 
appears to be biggest effect in Barro's list)
</li><li> 
more secondary and higher levels of schooling, 
</li><li> 
longer life expectancy (which presumably means good health)
</li><li> 
lower fertility rates, 
</li><li> 
lower government expenditures as GDP fraction
</li><li> 
more "rule of law"
</li><li> 
favorable trade relations with other countries (e.g. the USA made trade with Cuba
illegal, severely hurt Cuban economy) 
</li><li> 
high inflation (over 20% annually) kills economic growth
</li><li> 
<i>Democracy</i>.
</ul>

<p>
<i>But</i> democracy increases GDP in peculiar way (pictured):
increases in Barro's  political rights index from 0 to 5.6 on a scale of 0-10
(yielding a moderate level of freedom and democracy)
increased GDP growth rates additively by 2.6% 
<i>but</i> a further increase in the index from 5.6 to 10
<i>retarded</i> growth by <i>negative</i> 1.6%.
</p>

<p>
All of Barro's causative
factors (listed) cause approximately equal additive effects on predicted
real-GDP-growth-rate,
namely about 2-5% each.  That is, having the optimum level 5.6 of political rights
causes about 2.6% higher (additively) annual GDP growth rate than the pessimal
level 0;  countries about one standard deviation above usual in education levels are
predicted to have about 3% higher than usual annual-GDP-growth;
etc.
</p>

<p>
Correlation&ne;certainty so
democracy does not force a good economy.  E.g, China  doing better than India.
</p>

<H3> Why that peaking and <i>downturn</I>? </H3>

<p>
<b>Barro</b>
ideologically tries to explain by postulating:
more democracy &rArr; more government income redistribution &rArr; hurts growth.
But <b>attackable</b> because
Barro's fit <i>already</i> had incorporated government
expenditures
as <i>different</i> predictor; democratization was only being fit to
<i>unexplained</i> part of the GDP growth above and beyond that explainable
as  result of government outlays.
Barro partly
defends by saying that government <i>transfer</i> payments were <i>not</i> 
held constant.
But, assuming Barro has
idea that transfers aim toward <i>equalizing</i> wealth,
he is exactly <i>wrong</i> about its economic effect: 
the <a href="RVPapers.html">Deininger-Squires 1998 World Bank cross-country
study</a>
found that greater initial inequality is strongly <i>negatively</i> correlated
to future economic growth!
</p>

<p>
<small>
In other words, the "trickle down theory" often associated with Ronald Reagan
is wrong.
According to
George R. G. Clarke:
More Evidence on Income Distribution and Growth,
J. Development Economics 47,2 (Aug. 1995) 403-427,
"This conclusion is robust across different inequality measures,
and to many different specifications of the growth regression.
Furthermore, inequality appears to have a negative effect on
<i>both</i> democracies and non-democracies.
Interaction terms between inequality and regime type, when included in the
base regression, do not affect the sign or significance of [this]."
So this seems to settle the matter. (However, to <i>completely</i> clarify matters,
it would be good to put transfer payments into Barro's fit also, to see what happens.
And two other good predictors to try inserting would be a country's winter temperature
and the "centralization fraction" of its government 
[See A.Lijphart: <i>Democracies</i> 1984 table 10.2 page 178].)
</small>
</p>

<p>
<b>Two other possible explanatory hypotheses:</b> 
(more supported than Barro's):
<ol type="a">
<li> 
More democracy &rArr; dumb people make more dumb decisions &rArr; worse economic growth.
</li> 
<li> 
Even smart people make dumb decisions if the "decision-making algorithm" is "a poor
voting system."  If so, then replacing voting system with better one, e.g.
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, would yield
big  economic growth win, and that peak &amp; downturn
might be avoidable &ndash; the curve instead would just keep going up!
</li> 
</ol>
Which?  (Or both?)
If b &rArr; economic growth win attainable by switch to
Range or other better Voting 
appears <i>greater than attainable by altering any other factor</i> identified by Barro
(also seems much <i>easier</i> to change  voting system than to alter
any of those other factors).

</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's also <b>psychological reasons</b>,
<b>tactical reasons</b>,  and <b>"secondary effects"...</b>
</p>
<p>
Let's look into all these in a little more depth...
</p>

<hr>

<H2> Some theorems saying range voting reacts <i>mildly</i> to <i>strategic</i> voting </H2>

<p><b>Avoids favorite betrayal:</b>
In range voting, there is never a strategic reason to give your favorite a non-top score.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where favorite-betrayal often advisable.)
</p>

<p><b>Semi-honesty:</b>
In range voting, if you know all other votes (or in a &le;3-candidate election
even if you have only partial knowledge of the other votes), 
then there is always a strategically-optimal
"semi-honest" threshold-style vote, where create a "threshold" <font color="red">T</font> and
give all candidates better than <font color="red">T</font> score=99, all others score=0.
(Unlike: IRV, Condorcet, Borda, Plurality, where it can happen
that every honest &amp; semi-honest vote is non-strategic.)
</p>

<p><b>Pleasant surprise theorem:</b>
Suppose each voter chooses <font color="red">T</font>=their expectation of the value of the winner.
Then: the range-winner will maximize the number of voters who are "pleasantly surprised"
(result exceeds expectations).   That's an optimality property related to,
but not identical to, minimizing Bayesian regret.
</p>

<p><b>Range&rArr;Condorcet theorem:</b>
Suppose each chooses <font color="red">T</font> 
somewhere between candidates C and A, where C and A are viewed
as the two most likely to win.  If one of C or A is an honest-voter Condorcet
winner, then he will also be the range-winner.  (Suggests that in practice,
Condorcet cannot have much advantage over range.)

19-voter example illustrating 
&quot;<a href="FBCsurvey.html">Favorite Betrayal</a>&quot; &amp;  
&quot;<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a>.&quot;
<b>B wins</b>
under vast variety of rank-order election methods (e.g. Borda, Condorcet-LR, IRV).
</p>
<p>
<i>But</i> if the six
N>G>B voters <a href="AlteredExagg.html">insincerely switch</a>
to G>N>B ("<i><a href="FBCsurvey.html">betraying their favorite</a></i>" N)
then their "lesser evil" <b>G</b> becomes
the winner under all those voting systems &ndash;
in their view a <i>better</i> election result.
</p>

<p>
This favorite-betrayal example very important because, once voters understand 
exaggerating their stances on the apparent-frontrunners can be necessary to
prevent "greater evil"s victory, strategic voting is guaranteed, often causing
"third parties" to tend to die out (since the strategic voters won't
"waste their vote" on honest-favorite third-party candidates like N whom they perceive as
having "no chance of winning").  
</p>

<p>
<b>Range Voting:</b>
Favorite-betrayal <i>never</i> strategically forced.

<p>
Condorcet: <b>A</b> should win.
(A also wins under <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting method.)
Borda: no, <b>B</b> should win!
Who really should win?  Good question.
</p>
<p>
How would range voting handle this?
RV allows voters to say <i>how much</I> they
prefer B over A (or whoever).  <i>Quantitatively</i>.
Really, Borda or Condorcet are <i>both</i> right  &ndash; but  depending
on intensity-of-preference information  unavailable to their voting methods,
but available to range voting.  So this example illustrates an advantage of range voting
over both previous voting systems.

Several near-identical "clone" candidates run.

<b>Borda</b> voting (basically):  enough clones &rArr; opposite effect ("teaming");

Cloning the Bores &rArr; huge advantage!   Boring party can just arrange for mucho
Bores to enter the race &amp; totally Boring!
Of course,  Mushites could try to defeat that by intentionally lying in their
votes by ranking 
Bores in  opposite of true order, to try to cancel out
the Borites and make Mush win.  
But this strategy causes them to be massively dishonest in
their votes and risk not only a Bore-victory, but in fact a victory
by the <i>worst</i> of the Bores!  (Which would in fact happen if the Borons
<i>counter</i>strategized by <i>also</i> being dishonest in their Bore-orderings!)
Crazy!
</p>

<p>
Mushites: fight by nominating own clones, 
Mush<sub>1</sub>, Mush<sub>2</sub>, Mush<sub>3</sub>, and Mush<sub>4</sub>, 
so they'll win.
Bores: countersponsor <i>more</i> clones 
Bore<sub>4</sub>, Bore<sub>5</sub>, Bore<sub>6</sub>.
Etc.  War of clone armies.  
All about gall, little to do with what voters actually want.

parties to intentionally hurt <i>allies</i> of their point of view!

<b>1.</b>
In this 24-voter IRV election, <b>A wins</b> after C is dropped.
But now suppose every voter <i>reverses</i> his preference order (now
attempting to choose worst rather than best).
In that case  A <i>still</i> wins after B is eliminated.
I.e. <i>IRV contradicts itself</i>; IRV's unambiguously
"best" candidate A is here
the same as its "worst"!

Also illustrates bizarre kind of <i>strategic voting</i>:  Suppose
3 of the B>C>A voters reverse their votes to A>C>B (or alter them to A>B>C; that also works).
Then B is eliminated whereupon C wins 13-to-11 over A.
The <i>raising</i> of A from bottom-to-top in their vote caused A to <i>lose</i> &ndash;
and voting maximally dishonestly as though they were suicidally
trying to elect the <i>worst</i>
candidate, was actually <i>optimal strategy</i>!
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b>
Also illustrates "no show paradox":
If those three B>C>A voters had simply <i>refused to vote</i>,
then C would have won (an improvement in their view).   
Different way of saying the same thing:
these three voters' decision to cast an honest A-last vote
caused A to win.
</p>
<p>
Thus IRV violates <b>participation property:</B>
Honest voter, by participating, should not worsen election result (in her view).
I.e, "abstaining is not a better strategy than voting."

<p>
In district I, IRV eliminates C, then <b>B wins</b> 7:6.
In district II (same as district I but the roles of A and C are reversed),
<b>B also wins</b> 7:6.
But in the <i>combined</i> 2-district country,
B has 8 top-rank votes,
A and C have 9 each, so B is eliminated and either A or C wins.
Thus merging two districts both won by Bush under IRV, can produce an IRV
victory for Gore.

<p>
<b>Fraud prevention:</B> I want precinct totals to be <i>published</i>.
That's not going to happen if a precinct is going to
have to publish 6!=720 "totals" in one race.  (And even if that did happen, then this publishing
would defeat <i>ballot secrecy</i> and open the door to vote-selling and coercion.)

<h2> Risk of Tie and near-Tie "nighmare chad-counting lawsuit" scenarios </h2>
<p>
Here's an interesting hypothetical election to keep in mind when considering the risk of
ties under IRV (Instant Runoff Voting).
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="aqua">
<tr bgcolor="lightpink">
<th> %Voters </th>
<th> Their vote </th>

<tr>
<td> 50 </td>
<td> Kiss > Miller > Curley </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 25 </td>
<td> Curley > Miller > Kiss </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 25 </td>
<td>  Miller > Curley > Kiss </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
With plain plurality voting, Kiss wins in a landslide and there's no recount
called for.
</p><p>
With IRV Miller and Curley are nearly tied, and so all kinds of
recount lawsuit nonsense ensues.
Then the winner of that battle goes against Kiss, and then he and Kiss
are nearly tied and so <i>another</i> series of lawsuits ensues.

<H2> Condorcet ("beats-all") winners </H2>

<p>
Condorcet's idea: a winner should beat every rival <i>pairwise</i>.
(Unfortunately there can be a <i>cycle</i> and then no CW exists.)
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">

<p>
This 100-voter example election illustrates an old controversy between 
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
(1733-1799) and 
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>
(1743-1794).
According to Condorcet, A should win.
(Here A also wins under the <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> voting method.)
But according to Borda, B should win.
Who really should win?  Good question.
</p>

<p>
Now let's see how range voting would handle this.
If the voters say
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
51
</td>
<td align="center">
A=99, B=70, C=60
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    49
</td>
<td align="center">
B=95, C=90, A=85
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<th>
Average
</th>
<td align="center">
<b>A=92.14</b>,
B=82.25,
C=74.70
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
then A wins. But if they say

</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
51
</td>
<td align="center">
A=99, B=95, C=40
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    49
</td>
<td align="center">
 B=90, C=85, A=40
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<th>
Average
</th>
<td align="center">
A=70.09,
<b>B=92.55</b>,
C=62.05
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
then B is the winner.
</p>

<p>
The point is that range voting allows voters to say <i>how much</I> they
prefer B over A (or whoever). 
</p>
<hr>

<a name="tyrmaj"</a>
<h2> Tyranny of Majority </h2>

<p>Classic over-simplified and
over-dramatized example is the "kill the Jews" vote with choices
<ol type="A">
<li>
Kill the Jews and steal their money, using it to reduce taxes for
non-Jews.
</li><li>
The Jews (who are a minority) live.
</li></ol>
With honest Condorcet voting (i.e. honestly indicating the
choice that is best solely for that voter, no matter how slightly):
A wins.
<br>
But with honest range voting if the voters honestly express weak preference for A
but strong preference for B 
(because the voters who benefit from reduced taxes wish to indicate honestly 
that is a small gain for them, while the Jews who die, wish honestly to indicate 
that is a large loss for them), B can win. 
B is better for society overall.
<br>
<i>If</i> there is enough voter
honesty, range can deliver superior results than any other of
the usual voting method proposals.   No other commonly-proposed voting method can avoid
the "tyranny of the majority" problem.
</p>

<hr>

<a name="csqueeze"</a>
<h2> IRV can "squeeze out" Condorcet winners </h2>

<pre>
------------Leftist-------------Centrist--------------Rightist---------------
              35                   32                    33
</pre>

<p>
In this 3-candidate election, Leftist voters prefer Centrist&gt;Rightist and
Rightist voters prefer Centrist&gt;Leftist.
Result: Centrist is (huge) "Condorcet winner" defeating each rival pairwise by 
65:35 or larger majority.
</p><p>
<i>But</i>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) <i>eliminates</i> Centrist <i>immediately</I>.
This happened in e.g. <a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006</a>.
</P>

<hr>
<a name="condintent"</a>
<h2> What did Condorcet actually <i>intend?</i> </h2>

<p>
"When all but two candidates (X &amp; Y) are removed from all ballots
then X defeats Y, we say X "pairwise" defeats Y.   Condorcet demands that
a candidate who pairwise defeats 
every rival must win the election."
</p>

<p>
<b>Wait:</b> According to this wording, range voting <i>is</i> a Condorcet method!
</p>

<p>
(<b>BUT:</B> Accoding to the usual view, range is <i>not</i> a Condorcet method because,
e.g, one voter could have hugely-strong prefereces outweighing a lot of voters
all with very weak preferences.  In such case, no reason majority will win.)

fixed value K, such as 2 or 3) but no more. In range-voting, "no opinion" ("X") 
scores can also be permitted; these do not affect a candidate's average (then is

With plurality voting in an N-candidate election, you have N possible votes
(or N+1 if "not voting" is allowed and we count it as an additional option).
That is a lot less expressivity than approval voting with 2<sup>N</sup> possible
votes.   
With rank-order voting systems you have N! and with 0-99 range voting you have 100<sup>N</sup>
(or 101<sup>N</sup> if "no opinion" scores permitted for each candidate).
</p>

<p>
<b>Participation:</b>
If casting an honest vote can
never cause the election result to get worse (in that voter's view) than if she hadn't voted
at all,
then that voting system satisfies the "participation property."
(Some voting systems like Condorcet and IRV fail this &ndash; they exhibit "no-show paradox" 
elections
where some class of voters would have been better off "not showing up.")
</p>

<p>
<b>Favorite-safe:</b>
If it never is more strategic to vote a non-favorite ahead of your favorite,
then the voting system is "favorite-safe."  
(So-called because it is "safe" to vote for your favorite.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Clone-safe:</b>
If a "clone" of a candidate (rated almost identical to the original by
every voter) enters or leaves the race, that should not affect the winner
(aside from possible replacement by a clone).
We call voting systems obeying this "clone-safe."  
Borda and plurality voting severely fail this property.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="Monotone.html">Monotonicity</a></b>
is the property of a voting system that
<ol type="I">
<li>
If somebody increases their vote for candidate C (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not worsen C's chances of winning the election.
</li><li>
If somebody decreases their vote for candidate B (leaving the rest of their vote unchanged)
that should not improve B's chances of winning the election.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Remove-loser safe:</b>
If some losing candidate X is found to be a criminal and ineligible to run, 
then the same ballots should still be useable to conduct
an election with X removed, and should still elect the same winner.
(But if X's departure changes the winner, the property fails.  
In several voting systems, e.g. Borda,
X's departure can actually <i>reverse</I> the finish-order of all the other candidates,
a <i>dramatic</i> failure.)
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="IrvNonAdd.html">Precinct-countable</a>:</b>
If each precinct can publish a succinct summary of the vote (sub)total in that precinct,
and the overall country-wide winner can be determined from those precinct subtotals,
then the voting system is "precinct-countable."
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="VotMach.html">Dumb machines</a>:</b>
Are "dumb" (i.e. non-computerized) totalizing voting machines, designed only to support
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, useable for this voting system?
</p>

<p>
<b>Extremist/Centrist bias:</b>
Suppose the candidates are positioned along a line (1-dimensional)
or in a plane (2-dimensional) and voters prefer candidates located nearer to them.
In some voting systems, it is usually difficult or impossible for "centrists"
(centrally located relative to the other candidates) to win.
Those systems "favor extremists."
Other voting systems "favor centrists."
We apologize for defining this property rather vaguely, but in practice it is often
quite clear which category a voting system belongs in.
For example,
see <a href="IrvExtreme.html">these pictures</a> (especially "note #2")
to see that Instant Runoff (IRV) voting favors extremists.
</p>


<p>
<b>Simplicity:</b>
Voting systems with simpler rules, simpler counting algorithms, and found to be simpler
by human voters are "simpler."
If you want to be precise about this, then we point out you can objectively measure 
the "simplicity" of the rules and vote-counting algorithm as the length of the 
shortest computer program that inputs, checks-validity-of, and counts the votes to determine 
the winner.  And you can objectively measure how simple humans find it to vote by e.g,
comparing ballot <a href="SPRates.html">spoilage rates</a> under different voting systems,
or comparing the average <a href="ManyChoices.html#hot">time</a> it takes humans to cast their vote
or for other humans (or computers) to count them.

<p>
"Primary" effect (reckoned using Bayesian regret) = just who wins the election &amp; how

time in sequence of many elections.  When these also reckoned, RV looks even better...
</p>

<p>
<b>2-party <a href="Duverger.html">domination</a>:</b>  
In systems where "favorite betrayal" common enough,
"2-party domination" happens (third parties die out).   
2PD quickly became <a href="Strangle.html">massive</a> (&gt;99.5%)

Note <b>RV psychological drive for human honesty</b> &rArr;
<b>"nursery effect"</b> &rArr; RV far more likely than AV to

<H2> Psychology-aided effects </H2>

<p>
RV has some further advantages perhaps not mathematically explainable, but which instead are
<i>experimental</i> facts that are consequences of human psychology:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Altruism:</b>
Range Voters exhibit unstrategic honesty to far greater degree than plurality voters.
(76% of RV ballots manifestly unstrategic...  versus: 90% of the time US <i>plurality</i> voters 
can choose between strategic V honest, they pick strategic.)
</li><li>
<b>Nursery effect</b> follows: third parties should favor RV (unless death wish)
</li>
<a name="spoilrates"></a>
<li>
Range (and approval) voters have <b>low</b> ballot-invalidating <b>error rates</b>, 
while IRV voters
have high rates.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
Plurality: 1.0-3.1% spoiled (6 countries).  IRV: 3.4-6.2% spoiled (Australia 8 territories).
</td></tr></table>
Also &ge;7X increase IRV vs plurality <a href="SPRates.html">spoilage</a> rate in San Francisco.
<table align="center" bgcolor="lightyellow"><tr><td>
French 2002 approval study: 2.0% spoilage for official plurality votes, 0.3% for
approval exit-poll votes.
</td></tr></table>
Range: 0.026% spoilage rate (per <i>candidate</i>) observed in our exit poll; 99.5% confidence
that range rate per canddt is at least twice as small as USA's plurality error rate of 1.8%.
Similar results in <a href="OrsayTable.html">French study</a>.
One reason:
RV &amp; AV: every way to fill in scores is legal.  IRV &amp; plurality: not so.
Another(?): range &amp; approval voters repeatedly do the same operation many times in each race,
causing them to be more careful and inherently self-checking.  (Plurality: do it only once.)

<H2>  Iowa 2008 Pres-Primary Caucuses &ndash; perfect stage for range voting </H2>
<H3>  Tactics: All major power groups <i>want</i> RV in Iowa  (unlike usual) </H3>

<ol>
<li>  Iowa caucuses get tremendous media attention, have tremendous
impact despite small Iowa population. 
Mucho <i>publicity</i> for range voting.
</li>

<li>  Appears can change the rules without altering state or federal
law, only Dem. &amp; Repub. party internal procedures, central committee.
<i>Easier target.</i>
</li>
<li>  Iowa caucuses use pen &amp; paper ballots &amp; manual totaling (hand calculators
or adding machines).
Hence can easily institute single-digit range voting &ndash; essentially 
<i>no complexity penalty</i>
versus approval &amp; plurality.
</li>

<li> Both the Dems &amp; Repubs (at all levels: rank-and-file members countrywide
and Iowa-wide, Iowa state party leaders, national party leaders), 
are <i>motivated</i> to <i>want</i> to use
range so they can get a <a href="PlurPrim.html">better presidential nominee</a>,
and seem in favor of reform, and get free publicity;  Iowans may also
be in favor of change since many may believe Kerry (or Bush) was a mistake by them.
</li>
<li>  Because expect 10 Dem &amp; 10 Repub candidates, range voting will
have maximized <i>quality advantage</i> versus
plurality &amp; approval.  <a href="RandElect.html#RangePlur">Computer sims</a>:

<p><b>How bees do it:  &nbsp; (Robust log-time parallel algorithm!) </b>
<ol>
<li>
Scouting.  (Only 5%=scouts, rest sit there.)

More (&amp; hotter)

<h3> The Point </h3>

<p>
In the &infin;-time limit, the "bank account" with the greatest "interest rate"
wins, no matter who was richest at the beginning of the process.  The
interest (i.e. recruitment, i.e. faction-growth) rate in bee-elections
is by design/definition <i>proportional</I> to its range-vote score.

&there4; The range-voting winner is the faction which eventually dominates.

<p>
*(However, the bees do not <i>have</I> infinite time
&ndash; only willing to wait about 1 week
&ndash; and also since
only a finite number of bees,
there is <i>statistical noise</I>.  These non-idealities
could cause some other winner, if unlucky.)

<H2>  Some Theorems about range voting </H2>
<p><b><a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">CLONING+FB THEOREM</a> (WDS 2007):</b>
<i>Every</i> reasonable(*)
voting method based on rank-order votes is vulnerable either to candidate cloning or
to favorite-betrayal. But range voting has neither defect.
</p>

<p>
(*) "Reasonable" =
No "dictator,"
symmetric under candidate renaming,
deterministic aside from tiebreaks which (if any) are random equally likely.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Does range voting maximize happiness? No (unfortunately). What <i>does</i> it maximize?
</p><p>
<b>
MAX-PLEASANT SURPRISE THEOREM (Ossipoff; proof trivial):</b>
<i>Strategic</i> Range (if that means Approval-style) 
voting maximizes (under reasonable assumptions) the number of "pleasantly surprised"
voters and minimizes the number "unpleasantly surprised."
</p>

<p>
<b>The reasonable assumption:</b> strategic voters estimated expected utility 
(for them) E of
the winner, then "approve" candidates above E.
</p>
<p>
<b>"Surprise"</b> is "pleasant" if winner has utility above expectation.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>
CONDORCET THEOREM (WDS, easy):</b>
<i>Strategic</i> Range (Approval) voting yields (under reasonable assumptions) a 
"Condorcet winner" whenever one exists.
</p>

<p><b>
The reasonable assumption:
</b>
Approval voters act according to the
following strategy: they order the candidates from best-to-worst,
then select a "threshold" T, and they approve the candidates above T.
They choose T to cause their vote to have the most impact.
</p>
<p><b>
The precise claim:
</b>
Let N&ge;2.
There <i>does not exist</i> an N-candidate tie-free election 
in which the Approval (A) and Condorcet (C) winners differ, <i>provided</i>
that, if they were going to differ (A&ne;C) that all the approval voters would
place their threshold T strategically under the assumption the winner was going
to be either A or C, i.e. would place T somewhere between them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
Assume for a contradiction that A&ne;C.  Then the approval voters
will strategically place their thresholds
between C and A.
But that will cause C to be approved more times than A is approved (since C, being
the Condorcet winner, is preferred over A by a majority).  Hence the claim A
was the Approval winner and A&ne;C, leads to a contradiction.  Hence either A=C
or there is no Condorcet winner C.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>
<P>
<b>Interpretation:</b>
Range does as well as Condorcet if strategic voters (actually can yield CWs <i>more</i> often)
and better if honest voters.
</P>

<hr>
<p><b><a href="DhillonM.html">DHILLON+MERTENS (1999)</a> THEOREM:</b>
Normalized Range Voting ("normalized" meaning that every voter scores her favorite with the maximum allowable score and her most-hated candidate with the minimum) is the
<i>unique</i> voting system (in situations with at least 3 voters and at least 5 candidates)
obeying the following Arrow-like axioms:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>INDIV:</b></dt>
<dd>
If all voters are totally indifferent, so is society (note: "society" means
the <i>output</i> of the voting system).
</dd>
<dt><b>NONT:</b></dt>
<dd>
Society is not <i>always</i> indifferent.
</dd>
<dt><b>NOILL:</b></dt>
<dd>
If every voter is indifferent <i>except</i> for one voter,
then society is not always opposed to her.
</dd>
<dt><b>ANON:</b></dt>
<dd>
Permuting the voters has no effect.
</dd>
<dt><b>CONT:</b></dt>
<dd>
Continuity. This axiom is rather technical. But it
has in mind that
voter preferences are somehow continuously variable.
[You will need to consult the original paper to get the full details; I think they are trying to
say voter preferences must form a simply-connected compact set in a topological space, or
anyhow some subset of those concepts?]
</dd>
<dt><b>IRA:</b></dt>
<dd>
If a "candidate" which happens to be a lottery among
other candidates, is removed, then the election result
(as a full ordering) is unaltered.
</dd>
<dt><b>MON:</b></dt>
<dd>
Monotonicity.  
<ul>
<li>
One possible monotonicity-axiom would be that if society is indifferent about X versus Y,
and a new voter, who prefers X over Y, enters the picture, 
then the new augmented society should prefer X over Y.
</li><li>
A second such axiom could be that if society regards X as better than or equal to Y,
and a new voter comes who is indifferent about X versus Y, then 
the new augmented society should still regard X as better than or equal to Y.
</li><li>
A third such axiom could be that if
society regards X as better than or equal to Y,
and a new voter comes who prefers X over Y, then
the new augmented society should still regard X as better than or equal to Y.
</li></ul>
It is messy to state Dhillon and Mertens's monotonicity axiom,
which is why I am not stating it (see their paper); but suffice it to say 
that it actually is <i>weaker</i> than <i>any</i> of these three
axioms (i.e. any of them imply it, but the reverse implications do not hold).

<p><b>OPTIMALITY THEOREMS (WDS 2008):</b>
In a
<a href="BestVrange.html">breakthrough</a>,
<a href="Best4.html">II</a>,
<a href="BestVot2.html">III</a>,
developed methodology for determining the exact <i>best</I> rank-order, and <i>best</i>
range-style-ballot voting system (i.e. minimizing Bayesian Regret under some utility &amp; 
voter-behavior models).   Under the RNEM ("random normal elections model") 
the best rank-order ballot voting system for 3-candidate elections is <i>Borda.</i>
Range and Approval both are superior to Borda for any mixture 
of honest and strategic voters in 3-candidate elections.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sketch of Proof methods:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Best voting system maximizing expected utility of winner can be got by "remembering history 
forever."  
</li><li>
In principle this allows computer to "converge to" best voting system.
</li><li>
Can in some simple-enough probabilistic models (including RNEM) bypass the need for a computer!
</li><li>
The best voting systems and their BRs are expressed in terms of certain 
multidimensional integrals. Develop large <a href="BestVrange.html#ProcReg">
theory</a> of how to write &amp;
do those integrals 
(if &le;4 candidates, they all can be done in "closed form").
</li><li>
(There are also numerous related theorems, extensions to more candidates, etc.)

<a name="multime"></a>
<H2>  What about <i>multi</i>winner elections and 
<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>? </H2>

<ol>
<li>
"Bayesian Regret" at first seems only to be workable concept for <i>single</I>-winner 
elections.  Multiwinner systems are <b>little understood and little-explored.</b>
</li><li>
But a few years ago I <a href="BRmulti.html">saw</a>
how to extend it to multiwinner elections: "2-stage"
approach (voters elect parliament, then they elect social choices, and those have utilities)
</li><li>
This has not yet been tried (somebody allegedly working on programming it this year).
</li><li>
<i>Fundamental conflict</I>: PR leads to "better representation" but at the cost of
decreased accountability, feedback, and voter&rarr;politician control
(hence, presumably, lower <i>quality</I> politicians).
</li><li>
For example, "party list" systems (where you vote for party, not candidate) enable a
corrupt party boss to stay in power forever.  
</li><li>
What if party-X
members can vote to order the list for party X?
Or if we make voters vote for candidates, not parties, and <i>use</i> the
totals for party-X's candidates to order party-X's list? 
These ideas not fully satisfactory since then party-Y members have zero control over
party X's ordering.   
</li><li>
Another example: STV-PR systems <i>do</i> enable both PR and voting for candidates not parties. (<a href="Aus07.html">Australia</a>. <a href="Ireland1990.html">Ireland</a>.)
But can <a href="PRcond.html">refuse</a>
to elect a landslide Condorcet winner! (<a href="STVPRunger.html">more</a>)
</li><li>
The historical/economic evidence is <a href="proprep.html">unclear</a> 
on whether PR or single-winner are superior.

<a href="Asset.html">Asset voting</a> and <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a> (reweighted range voting)
