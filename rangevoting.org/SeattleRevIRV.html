<H2> "Best is Worst" problem with Seattle's 2022 proposal for "top 2 IRV open primary" </H2>

<p><small>by Warren Smith, Oct 2022.
</small></p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle"><b>Seattle</b></a> in 2022 proposed ("ballot proposition <b>1B</b>")
this system:
</p><ol><li>
a "primary" election would be held using rank-order  ballots (every voter
permitted to rank every candidate regardless of party)
to select <b>two</b> winners via an Instant Runoff (IRV) procedure.
</li><li>
Those two then
would compete against each other is a later "general election"
to elect just one of them.
</li></ol><p>
The Instant Runoff procedure is:
The candidate with fewest top-rankings is eliminated, reducing a C-candidate election to <nobr>C-1.</nobr>
We then eliminate again to reach <nobr>C-2</nobr>, and so on, until only 2 candidates remain: Seattle's two
primary-winners.
</p><p>
Now let's look at an <b>example</b> of that process in action.
There are 20 voters and 4 candidates named "A," "B," "C," and "D."
Here are <b>the rank-order ballots:</b>
</p>
    
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 9 </td><td> A&gt;D&gt;C&gt;B </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 7 </td><td> B&gt;D&gt;C&gt;A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 3 </td><td> D&gt;B&gt;A&gt;C </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 1 </td><td> C&gt;A&gt;B&gt;D </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
C has the fewest top-rankings (1, as opposed to D=3, B=7, A=9)
hence the IRV procedure eliminates C.
Next, D has the fewest top-rankings (3, as opposed to A=10, B=7)
so IRV next eliminates D.
We are left with
a perfect 10-10 tie between A and B, and the general election contenders
thus are <b>A and B</b>.
</p><p>
The proponents of this IRV<sup>2</sup> primary system contend  these two candidates A and B are
(by far) the two best choices for Seattle, while C and D therefore are its two worst choices.
Wonderful: Seattle gets good leaders, namely A or B.
</p><p>
But now let's
investigate what would happen if all 20 voters <i>reversed</i> their preference orders.
They sadly are now ordering their four choices worst-first instead of best-first.
Hence then 
the IRV process presumably sadly will pick the two worst choices for Seattle.
<b>The reversed rank-order ballots:</b>
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="pink">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 9 </td><td> B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;A </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 7 </td><td> A&gt;C&gt;D&gt;B </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 3 </td><td> C&gt;A&gt;B&gt;D </td></tr>
<tr><td align="middle"> 1 </td><td> D&gt;B&gt;A&gt;C </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Now the IRV process eliminates D, then C, again leaving a perfect 10-10 tie
between A and B for "first" place.
</p><p>
The proponents of this IRV<sup>2</sup> primary system contend  these two candidates A and B are
(by far) the two worst choices for Seattle, while C and D therefore are its two best choices.
This would be terrible: Seattle would get bad leaders, namely A or B.
</p>

<!--  
fwd:
9: A>D>C>B
7: B>D>C>A
3: D>B>A>C
1: C>A>B>D

rev:
9: B>C>D>A
7: A>C>D>B
3: C>A>B>D
1: D>B>A>C
 -->

<p>
Wait. What?
</p><p>
This bass-ackwards example &ndash; and this sort of phenomenon seems entirely realistic &ndash;
shows one way Seattle's proposed
IRV<sup>2</sup> primary system can <b>contradict itself</b>.
As you can see, it can equally well deliver the two best choices for Seattle, or the two worst,
to the general election, with no clue which is which.
</p><p>
If my election system delivers sub-optimal winners, I at least want to hope they aren't
going to be the <i>worst</i>.  But then if that <i>same</i> election system <i>itself</i>
says they are the worst, but crams them down my throat <i>anyway</i>, that's really a bit much.
</p><p>
Good luck with that, Seattle!
</p><hr><p>
You might want to decide who <i>you</i> think should be the 2 winners in the original election.
If you care about my personal opinion, it is: the best pair 
actually would have been <b>A &amp; D</b>, and the worst B &amp; C.
<!-- These are the "<a href="Glossary.html#SmithSet">Schwarz sets</a>" for the original
and reversed elections. No {A} is. -->
The "Pairwise preference matrix" is
</p>
<table  bgcolor=#cccccc border=2>
  <tr><td>Option</td><td align=center>A</td><td align=center>B</td><td align=center>C</td><td align=center>D</td></tr>
  <tr><td align=center>A</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td><td bgcolor=#FFFFCC">12</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td></tr>
  <tr><td align=center>B</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCFF">8</td></tr>
  <tr><td align=center>C</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCFF">8</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCFF">1</td></tr>
  <tr><td align=center>D</td><td bgcolor=#FFCCFF">10</td><td bgcolor=#FFFFCC">12</td><td bgcolor=#FFFFCC">19</td><td bgcolor=#CCCCCC">0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
showing that each member of {A,D} beats each member of {B,C} by at least a 12:8 majority,
except that A doesn't "beat" B, but rather merely is pairwise-tied 10:10 with B.
(Also A is pairwise-tied with D, and B with C.)
No other candidates besides A and D enjoy this "beats or ties all others" property.
</p><p>
My view also is supported by the fact "Borda scoring" ranks the candidates in this order: D&gt;A&gt;B&gt;C
with scores
D=41,
A=35,
B=28,
C=19.
Also, if we were to employ "approval voting" where each voter "approved" her top two candidates and
disapproved her bottom two, then A+D would get 29 approvals, more than any other pair.
</p><p>
One reason IRV was unable to realize all that was the fact IRV always massively
<a href="IgnoreExec.html">ignores</a> much information on the ballots, while Borda and the Pairwise Matrix do not.
This was a 2-winner
example of IRV <a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal failure</a>.
