<H3> Criteria obeyed by score voting </H3>

<p><b>1. Generically untied:</b>
In the limit of a large number of voters with some nonzero proportion voting randomly, the
probability <a href="TieRisk.html">of</a> 
a tied election (non-unique winner) goes to zero.  Indeed with 
"continuum range voting" ties have probability=0 if there is even a single 
uniformly-random ballot.
</p>

<p><b>2. No dictator (and no vetoer):</b>
"No elector shall be able to force a winner of his choosing (or force somebody 
of his choosing <i>not</i> to win) regardless of the preferences of everybody else."
</p>

<p><b>3. Unanimity:</b>
"If a candidate is the unanimous favorite of every voter, it should be the winner."
Also, "If every ballot scores A ahead of B, the voting method output shall rank A ahead of B,
and in particular B cannot win."
</p>

<p><b>4. Indifference to Irrelevant Options:</b>
"The voting system's output's relative ranking of two candidates A,B should depend only on 
their relative positions within ballots and <i>not</i> on those for other candidates C.
So if/when we consider only a subset of candidates, the voting system should 
not change its output-ordering within this subset."
</p>

<p><b><a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a>:</b>
Says that there is no voting system <i>based on rank-orderings as ballots</i>
that meets criteria 2-4 and never is tied.
But score voting (with some tiebreak rule added) <i>does</i> meet these criteria.  
It can, and does, evade Arrow's "proof of impossibility" because it does
not use rank-orderings as ballots, but rather numerical candidate-<i>ratings</i>.
</p>

<p><b>5. <a href="Monotone.html">Monotonicity</a>:</b>
Both
<ol type="I">
<li>
If some set of voters increase their vote for candidate C 
(meanwhile leaving the rest of their vote unchanged, 
or decreasing votes for C-rivals)
that should not worsen C's chances of winning the election.
</li><li>
If some set of voters decrease their vote for candidate B 
(meanwhile leaving the rest of their vote unchanged,
or increasing votes for B-rivals)
that should not improve B's chances of winning the election.
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>6. Loser-independence:</b>
"In an election where X is a winner: after adding a new candidate Y, the new 
winner can only be X or Y."  Similarly, if a losing candidate is removed, that should
not alter the winner.

<!--???
Non-overvaluation
"A voter should not be able to overstate a candidate to his favorite book easy to defeat duel candidate."
The current system of presidential elections in France does not meet this criterion .
The Vote of value meets this criterion by removing the second round, rendered useless.
-->

<p><b>7. <a href="CandCloning.html">Cloneproof</a>:</b>
Definition: "A set of clones is a set of candidates ranked adjacent to each other
on each ballot (in some order which may vary depending on the ballot), for
voting systems based on rank-orderings as ballots.  For voting systems based on numerical ratings,
the 'clones' must all have ratings equal to within &plusmn;&epsilon; in the limit &epsilon;&rarr;0,
on each ballot."
</p><p>
Cloneproofness: "If clones are added (or eliminated, so long as at least one remains), 
then the winner should not change
except perhaps to a clone of the old winner."
</p>

<p><b>8. Partitionable:</b>
"Partition the voters into two subsets, such the Northern and Southern ones. 
Suppose that the same candidate X is elected by the North and by the South.
Then X must be elected countrywide."
</p>

<p>
<b>9. Participation:</b>
"If a new ballot which scores the current winner W top, is added to the election,
this should not alter the winner."  
(Actually, that was a special case of #8.)
Also: "If a new ballot which scores some loser
L bottom is added to the election, this should not cause L to win."

</p>

<p>
<b>10. Reversal symmetry:</b>
"If a candidate is winning and then we 'reverse' every ballot,
the same candidate will lose."
(Applied to vote value, the operation is to negate the scale of values;
for a rank-ordering ballot it is to reverse all the orders.)
</p>

<p>
<b>11. Does not incentivize Favorite-Betrayal:</b>
A voter cannot achieve a better election result (in her view) by dishonestly scoring her
true-favorite candidate, below topmost.
</p>

<p>
<b>12. Neutrality:</b>
(aka symmetry under candidate renaming):
Permuting the candidate names 
on each ballot permutes their winning probabilities in the same way.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">Smith-Simmons impossibility theorem</a>:</b>
No voting system based on rank-orderings as ballots can obey criteria 
2, 7, 11, 12.  But score voting accomplishes this "impossible" feat because
its ballots are not rank-orderings of the candidates, but rather assignments of
numerical scores to them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Asterisk about "normalized" and "no opinion" score voting rule-variants:</b>
A score ballot is "normalized" if it employs 
the maximum allowed score and employs the minimum allowed score, at least once each.
Some criteria above obeyed by score voting (e.g. #4, 6), can become disobeyed if we demand
all ballots be normalized.  Also, in "highest average wins" score voting 
rules where voters are allowed to express "no opinion" about candidates 
(instead of scoring them), #8, 9 can be disobeyed.
</p>

<p>
<b>13. NESD:</b>
Assume all voters initially honest, and election initally untied.
A single-winner voting system obeys the "NESD property" if, after <i>every</i> voter 
"exaggerates about A and B," i.e.
changes her ballot to now rank A top and B bottom 
(or B top and A bottom; which depends on the voter and is "honest"), 
leaving it otherwise unaltered, then there exist untied
elections in which somebody besides A or B wins.
(The NESD criterion is not applicable to
"multiround" voting systems, in which the voters vote
a second time, knowing the result of the first election.  Perhaps it could be made applicable
by modifying the definition of NESD, but we do not attempt that now.)
I speculate that 1-round voting systems failing the NESD criterion will 
yield 2-party domination.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Contrast with other voting systems:</b>
Plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting disobeys 4, 
<a href="PlurBadRemove.html">6</a>, 7, 10, 11, 13.
Instant (and non-instant) runoff voting both disobey 4, 5, 
<a href="IRVbadRemove.html">6</a>, 
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">8</a>, 
<a href="IrvPartic.html">9</a>, 
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">10</a>, 
<a href="IRVcs.html">11</a>, 13.
The non-instant 2-round "plurality+top-two" runoff system (used in France 2013) and
various IRV-like systems involving, e.g. ranking only the top three (but not all) candidates
(used in San Francisco 2013), also disobey 7.  
The "Borda count" disobeys 4, 
<a href="rangeVborda.html#JoghnsonEx">6</a>, 
<a href="rangeVborda.html#clones">7</a>, 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">11</a>.
All Condorcet systems disobey 
8, 
<a href="CondPF.html">9</a>, 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">11</a>, 
13.  Score-voting-like systems based
on <i>median</i> instead of <i>average</i> score disobey 
<a href="MedianVrange.html#partic">8</a>, 
<a href="MedianVrange.html#partition">9</a>
(they would also disobey 1 &amp; 13, but if certain tie-breaking schemes are added
as in <a href="MedianVrange.html#GMJ">GMJ</a> instead of
just naively using the median score alone, then 1 &amp; 13 come back to life).

<!--Every system obeying majority-top (below) fails NESD*.-->
</p>


<H3> Naively desirable-sounding criteria <i>dis</i>obeyed by score voting </H3>

<p>
<b>1. Secret preferences:</b> (Also has been called "later no harm"):
"If a candidate X wins and the preferences are changed among the candidates scored below X
on some ballot, then X still should win."
</p><p>
(We think this criterion is undesirable:  raising some rival R of the current winner W
from last to second place on your W-top ballot, should instead be allowed sometimes to
cause R now to win.   Those in favor of this property have argued that 
without it, voters will fear hurting their favorite by honestly scoring their 
second-favorite high, thus will be incentivized to lie about their second-favorite.
But with, say, a voting method like IRV complying with this property, voters 
<i>still</i> have incentive to lie about both their favorite and second favorite.)
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Majority-top:</b>
"If a candidate X is the favorite of a majority of voters (i.e. is scored top on
more than 50% of the ballots)
then X must win.
</p><p>
(We think this criterion is undesirable:  a candidate scored top by 51% and bottom by 49%
of the voters, might really be a worse choice than one scored near-top by 100% of
the voters.)
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Mutual-Majority-top:</b>
"If every member of some subset X of candidates is scored above all others 
on more than 50% of the ballots,
then some member of X must win.
</p><p>
(Undesirable for same reason.)
</p>

<p><b>4. Condorcet winner:</b>
"If there is a Condorcet winner, i.e. a candidate C who is scored above R on
more than 50% of the ballots (for every rival R, albeit the ballot-set is allowed to depend on R), 
then C must win."
</p><p>
<i>But:</i> Score voting <i>does</i> obey the closely related condition that
"If there is a candidate C who would win an election versus R if all candidates 
besides C and R were erased from all ballots (and this is true for every R&ne;C), then C
must win."
(And this modified criterion might actually have been what Condorcet himself wanted!)
</p><p>
Also, in the presence of <i>strategic voters</i> 
voting methods which are guaranteed to elect Condorcet
winners with honest voters, may no longer elect a candidate who would have been
an honest-votes Condorcet winner &ndash; but approval and score voting under certain
<a href="AppCW.html">assumptions</a>
about strategic voter behavior <i>will</i> elect any candidate who would have been a
Condorcet winner using honest votes!  Paradoxically, this effect 
can cause approval and score voting 
actually to elect more Condorcet winners in real life, than methods obeying the
Condorcet winner criterion!!
</p>

<p><b>5. Smith-set winner:</b>
"If there is a set S of candidates such that for each candidate C&isin;S,
more than 50% of the ballots score C above R 
(for every R&notin;S; the majority-forming ballot-set is allowed to depend on R and C), 
then some member of S must win."
</p><p>
<i>But:</i> Score voting <i>does</i> obey a closely related condition, similar modification 
to above.
</p>

<!--
<p><b>Contrast with other voting systems:</b>
Plain plurality voting disobeys 1, 4, 5 (2 is obeyed and 3 is inapplicable).
Instant (and non-instant) runoff voting both disobey 4, 5.
(IRV obeys 1, 2, 3??).
The "Borda count" disobeys all of 1-5 but
many Condorcet systems obey them all.
-->

<h3> Criteria, while interesting and useful for enhancing understanding,  
should <i>not</i> be your foundation </h3>

<p>
<a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a> is what voting system comparisons should 
rest on, not logical criteria.   
</p><p>
Problems with criteria: <i>qual</i>itative and
 "all or nothing" &ndash; each criterion is either obeyed or not
by a voting system.  No <i>quant</i>itative notion of "how often" and "how severely."
Also, maybe "my criterion is important and yours is not"... except you disagree!
That kind of argument never ends.
Also, maybe there is some important criterion that has not yet been invented.
Bayesian regret bypasses those problems: automatically assesses all possible criteria
(whether anybody ever invented them, or not) correctly weighting according to 
frequency and severity of failures,  <i>quantitatively</i> 
measures "how much social utility" a voting system "loses" compared to 
hypothetical and unachievable "optimum" system.
</p>

<H3> News flash! </H3>
<p>
"Only criteria <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> obeys
can be regarded as 'good' criteria."
