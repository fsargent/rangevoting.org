<h1>SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT RANGE VOTING</h1>

<p>	Jeanne
Eisenstadt</p>
<p>	PhD,
Social Psychology</p>

<p><u>Range Voting (RV) vs
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV).</u></p>

<p>Runoff
voting is already familiar to voters, and IRV would make only a small
change.   RV introduces a totally different technique of assessment,
and trying to implement it would face many more individual and
political obstacles.</p>

<p>J.C.
Nunnally, in his 1967 book on Psychometric Theory (brief extract on
validity of rating scales available on the web) has several arguments
for preferring comparative judgments (of which ranks are one) to
absolute judgments (of which RV is one).</p>

<p>He
argues that making comparative judgments is a natural process, known
and used by the time we graduate from kindergarten &ndash;
we can
easily say who is bigger, older, smarter, etc.  Converting these
comparative assessments into absolute numbers does not happen
naturally and is not how we make our choices in "real life."
</p>

<p>Furthermore,
he finds that comparative methods are far more accurate, reliable and
consistent than absolute methods. 
</p>

<p>He
states that,</p>
<bockquote>
<font color="#333366">"Whereas
people are notoriously <b><i>inaccurate</i></b> when judging
[absolutely], they are notoriously <b><i>accurate</i></b> in making
comparative judgments." (emphasis added)</font>
</blockquote>

<h1>The Rating Scale as a Form of Assessment</h1>

<p>In
many ways, range voting is equivalent to providing a separate <u>rating</u>
for each candidate.  Therefore, I looked for what I could find out
about rating scales.</p>

<h2>Number Of Categories</h2>

<p>In
an article on Communication Validity and Rating Scales (1996) W.
Lopez states that:</p>

<p>
"Each
category is intended to increase the discrimination of the rating
scale and so to increase the information in all responses. But
confrontation by too many response alternatives muddles respondents.
Respondents rarely make stable discriminations among more than 6
levels. Sometimes 2 or 4 levels are all they can negotiate. Excess
categories introduce more noise than information by forcing
respondents to make their fine choices idiosyncratically, such as by
preference for even or odd numbering."
</p>

<p>(It
seems likely that voters in a situation of range voting would be
pushed to all use the most extreme ratings, and this would further
nullify the ostensible value of having the option of choosing from a
large number of values.) 
</p>


<h4>Missing Zero Point; Unequal Intervals, Or Lack Of
Calibration 	</h4>

<p>There
is general agreement among psychometricians  that raw scores on a
rating scale do not correspond to equal and interchangeable units of
the quality being measured, even when the scale consists of numbers
that appear to be equally distant from each other. Therefore, NO
ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS ARE LEGITIMATE.  This includes the simple
process of adding scores from different people to get a single total.
 A vote of 6 points is not twice as big as a vote of 3 points, and
they cannot be added together to get a total of 9 points.</p>

<p>In
response to this problem, testers have created 5-point and 7-point
scales, with 0 in the middle and including descriptions of the
meaning of each point, for instance, strongly agree, agree, 0,
disagree, strongly disagree.  This reduces the difficulty, but does
not eliminate it.</p>

<p>A
global rating, with no specification of what the numbers mean, has
maximum ambiguity and volatility:  it is neither reliable (repeatable
from one time to another) nor valid (an accurate representation of
what, supposedly, is being measured).  
</p>

<p>In  RV, one essentially is reduced to the "operational definition"
that degree of preference for a candidate does not exist apart from
the operation of assigning points on the ballot.    
</p>

<h4>Ambiguity About How To Express Neutral/Negative
Response</h4>

<p>Range
voting is ambiguous with respect to neutral or negative votes. 
Because of the prevalence in our experience in other settings of 5
and 7 point scales, as above, some might treat RV as a scale in which
the middle number is neutral and the lower numbers are negative. 
Others might treat it as only the positive part of the scale, with
neutral and negative votes undifferentiated and all mixed together,
and reported as either a 1 &ndash; the lowest score &ndash; or 0 &ndash;
no approval at all.  Also included in this heterogeneous mix would be
people who want to opt out of the choosing process altogether.</p>

<h1>Rater Bias
Distorts Ratings</h1>

<p>Assertiveness; extremism vs moderation.</p>
<p>Raters
&ndash;
and voters &ndash;
differ in their habitual preference for
using ratings at the extremes, or keeping to the middle/moderate
parts of a scale.</p>

<p><u>Mood,
fatigue, and habit</u> may incline a person either toward the
positive or toward the negative end of ratings.	</p>
