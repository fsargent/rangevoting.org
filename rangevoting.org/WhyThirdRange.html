<H2> Why third parties should support range voting and not IRV &ndash; made simple </H2>

<p>
<b>STEP 1.</b>
Suppose least 67% of voters, in an effort to maximize the impact of
their vote, vote the two major parties
<ol type="a">
<li>TOP
</li><li>
BOTTOM (or nearly)
</li></ol>
</p><P>
In Australia, which uses IRV, this currently <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">happens</a>
about 
90-95% of
the time. In the USA, which uses Plurality, Nader-favorite voters
in 2000 chose to vote other-than-Nader over 90% of the time (say NES poll data;
<a href="Burden.pdf">Burden's paper</a>).
This behavior by voters is logical because with IRV there is 
<a href="TarrIrv.html">favorite-betrayal incentive</a>  (it often is beneficial to voters to betray
third-party favorites, especially when they might have a chance to win) whereas with
range voting no such incentive exists. Ever.
</p><P>
<b>STEP 2.</b>
It then is a theorem, which even IRV advocates ought to be able to prove,
that a third party can never win. (In IRV voting.) 
</p><P>
<b>STEP 3.</b>
But what if we had the exact same voter thinking and behavior, but now
using Approval or Range voting?
</p><P>
<b>STEP 4.</b>
It then is a theorem, which even IRV advocates ought to be able to prove,
that a third party candidate <i>could</i> win without necessarily experiencing any difficulty.
</p><P>
<b>STEP 5.</b>
This is not a hypothetical scenario. It has actually really happened.
A lot.  Indeed, in the 2007 Australian elections, there <a href="Aus07.html">appear</a>
to have been
at least 9 (probably more like 20)
federal IRV seats in which the Green was preferred by a voter majority over
every rival, and the voters said that in their IRV votes.   
Of course, with IRV voting, the Green candidate lost every one of those 
races by a huge margin, not even coming close to either major-party candidate,
and resulting as usual in zero  IRV federal seats won by
all Australian third parties.  With Condorcet voting the Greens
would have won those seats.  With range 
and approval voting, they probably <a href="AppCW.html">also</a> would have.
</p><P>
<b>STEP 6.</b>
So third parties are suicidally stupid to support IRV when they could
support Range voting.
</p><P>

<h2> Unless... </h2>

<p>
of course, like the Australian Greens, they want to lose every
single IRV election for a federal IRV seat, they ever participate in
(except for the single election the Aussie Green managed to win in 2002
when one of the major parties did not
run for the seat).
But oddly enough, the Australian Greens do not enjoy that! They <a href="AusIRV.html">want</a>
to abolish IRV and remake Australia so that IRV is never used in any
election there ever again. They say so right in their party platform!
</p><P>
Now we predict, that if the USA switches to IRV, there still will be
2-party domination, just like in Australia &ndash; only more severe.
We predict that then, at long last, the US Greens (assuming there are
any remaining at that point) will then, just like the Australians, try
to get rid of IRV because it has dawned on them that it causes them to
lose essentially all the time.
</p><P>
I'm suggesting <i>skipping forward</i> a step in this process. I'm
suggesting that the US Greens &ndash; and every other US third party &ndash;
support a single-winner voting system that allows them
to <i>win</i> races. (This is not to say we are opposed to having
multi-winner voting systems also. But for Senator, Governor,
President, and House seats in small states, multi-winner systems are
simply not useable.)
</p><P>
I realize that winning a race is a stunning, incredible, idea that US
Greens may not be ready to adjust to and perhaps would never have
thought of without the aid of <a href="">RangeVoting.org</a>. 
But nevertheless, what the heck.  I suggest it
to them. After all, they claim the fate of the world is at stake
and their ideas for saving it (ecology, etc) are key and heavily
ignored by the top 2 parties. So perhaps the US and world would be
better off if some Greens won federal seats.
</p><p>
Or, we could adopt a more complicated voting system &ndash; IRV &ndash; almost
guaranteed to make them always lose. Which course seems wiser for the
US Greens?
</p><P>
You choose to live, or you choose to die.
Is this that hard a choice?
