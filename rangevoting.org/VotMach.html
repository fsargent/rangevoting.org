<H2> Which voting machines can handle which election systems? </h2>

<p>
<a href="#botline">(Skip to bottom line)</a> &nbsp;
<a href="VMSumm.html">(Executive summary)</a>
</p>

<p> 
Both <i>single-digit Range</i> (permitted scores 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and X)
and <i>Approval</i> elections
can be handled by any kind of voting machine capable of handling multiple plurality
elections, i.e. every voting machine in the USA, without modification.
The underlying reason for this is Jan Kok's <a href="assets/documents/kokidea.txt">mathematical transformation</a>.
<font size="-1">An extension of this
method can also be used (as is explained in more generality <a href="assets/data/kok2ndlevel.tex">here</a>)
to handle two-digit range voting elections (i.e. range 0-99 rather than 0-9)
on plurality machines, <i>but</i> only if the voter's
"X (intentional blank)" option is sacrificed.</font>
Here are <a href=BallotPict.html>examples</a>
of how sample ballots would look on different voting machine types,
and here is a <a href="presdemo/PresBallot.html">demo</a> range election  
you can participate in yourself (try it!) a 
<a href="quickdemo/PresBallot.html">quicker demo</a> and a version of the quicker demo
that demonstrates 
<a href="quickdemo/PresRadio.html">
what range voting would be like on a plurality-style voting machine.</a>
</p>

<H3> But wait... </H3>

<p><b>Q.</b>
But, I asked some voting machine manufacturers 
"Do your machines support range voting?" and they said "No."
</p>

<p><b>A.</b>
Try asking them this way instead: 
<ol>
<li>
"Do your machines support ordinary plurality voting?" (Answer: "Yes.")
</li><li>
"There is a <a href="assets/documents/kokidea.txt">theorem</a> that, given a black box that does plurality voting, 
we can use it to do range voting.  Do you dispute this theorem?"
</li>
</ol>

<H3> Is this inconvenient? </H3>

Depends on the voting machine type and the election.
With <i>optical scan</i> machines, the best and most common type in the 2004 USA,
range voting is maximally easy and convenient.
(Check <a href="VotSystMap.html">this map</a> to see how many Americans vote on
what kinds of machines and where.)
</p>

<p>
With range ballots
run on ordinary plurality voting machines, slots (e.g. "levers" on
New York style machines) get "chewed up" 10 times faster than
with plain plurality voting.  (Assuming 10 allowed scores.
With 100 allowed scores, 20 times faster.  With L
allowed socres for 1&lt;L&lt;10, L times faster.)

Consequently if it is a large enough election or if there are too many elections, 
you'd run out of levers and more
machines would be needed (or you'd have to use range voting with fewer levels).
Which would not be so fun.

On the other hand with say, optical scan machines, you'd instead "chew up 
those little pen-fill blobs on the piece of paper" which seems far
less of a limitation. (Indeed, range voting on such machines actually strikes
us as <i>more</i> convenient and clear than plurality voting.)
Ditto with many kinds of punch card machines.

So we are not saying range voting is wonderful to run on
all plurality machines.  We <i>are</i> saying, it can be done on
every plurality machine in the USA, with varying levels
of convenience or inconvenience depending on the machine type 
and the election.   (The most inconvenience occurs on certain kinds of punch card machines,
but fortunately these <a href="VotSystMap.html">are rare</a> and their use-fraction 
is declining.)

We do not especially recommend running range elections in this style.
We would much prefer to have voting machines <i>specifically designed</i>
for range voting.  However, because range voting <i>can</i> be done on
plurality machines as a stopgap measure, that makes it a lot
more smoothly adoptable than many other forms of voting, for
example IRV and Condorcet, which simply
<i>cannot</i> be done on many kinds of plurality machines.

<H3> What we recommend </H3>

<ol type="A">
<li>
For use with dumb plurality machines, and in Iowa'08 (pen &amp; paper ballots with
manual totalling), we advocate 0-9 and X
single-digit range voting.
</li>
<li>
For rare especially horrible types of plurality machines (perhaps levers or, worst of all,
all-punches-in-a-row "butterfly ballot" punch card types) on which 0-9 is too nasty, we
advocate 0-1 and X, e.g. "trinary approval." But there should be a law demanding these
machines all be phased out by some deadline.  This will not be a serious issue
because most ballot-initiative states (i.e. the states in which we plan to make
a play to get Range Voting after Iowa '08 hopefully adopts range voting) 
do not use these worst kinds of plurality
machines, and by that time (2010) even fewer states and counties will. 
You can confirm this by checking
this <a href="VotSystMap.html">2004 machine-types map of the USA</a>
and the
<a href="BallInit.html#ballstatelist">
list of ballot-initiative states</a>.
</li>
<li>
For use with future machines specifically designed for range voting, we advocate
0-99 and X (or perhaps even 0-99999 and X), with
multiplication
of the 0-9 results by 11 to get compatibility with coexisting 0-99
machines.
</li>
<li>
This all will have the advantage that it permits <i>easy migration</i> to the
range system
<i>without</i> needing to buy all new machines, but at the same time provides continual
<i>incentive</i> to <i>upgrade</i> to 0-99 machines actually designed for range voting, since
some voters will want the extra fineness (about 5% in our polls used votes like
98 and 73, and about 30% employed numbers like 75 and 35, both with an 0-100 permitted score
range).
</li>
<li>
The smaller ranges like 0-9 and 0-1 will be mandated to be phased out by
a certain date,
resulting in uniformity with all machines at the maximum range.
</li>
</ol>

<H3> What kinds of voting machines are the best? </H3>

<p>
Since you asked, there is a general "consensus"
<font size="-1">(The
word "consensus" is from Andrew Gumbel's <a href="RVPapers.html">book</a>.)</font>
being reached that 
<b>precinct-based "optical scan"</b> 
voting machines are (as of 2005) the best kind available measured
by a combination of the following: 
<ol>
<li>
Value for money (i.e. they are cheap, as opposed to "DRE" machines which are by contrast 
extremely expensive)
</li>
<li>
Simplicity, <a href="pressrelease_2006_0828.html">security</a>,
reliability, and durability (as opposed to DRE machines which are
by contrast very complex and unreliable and fragile and subject to hacking &ndash; and whatever you
do, do not be a total idiot by getting one with wireless communication capability)
</li>
<li>
Small size, weight, and storage space requirements 
(as opposed to DRE machines which are
by contrast very large; mechanical lever machines are very heavy)
</li>
<li>
Recountable/auditable "paper trail" produced as inherent side-effect of use
(as opposed to many DRE machines, and to lever machines; punch card machines
are innaccurate and have problems with "hanging chads" and easy overvote-fraud;
even those DRE machines which do produce paper trails do it with a printer which means
big unreliability, complexity, and expense compared to voters filling in the paper themselves as
in optical scan)
</li>
<li>
Work well for use with range voting &ndash; not just plurality voting.
</li>
<li>
<a href="pressrelease_2006_0828.html">More accurate</a>
(lower <a href="Spoiled.html">lost-vote</a> rates) than punch card and full face DRE systems.
</li>
<li>
Opscan machines process far more voters (so you need fewer of them).
A 2006 study by NY Verified Voting estimated
that a DRE machine can handle only 200 registered voters, while a single precinct based
optical ballot scanner, with sufficient numbers of inexpensive marking booths,
can serve up to 4000 registered voters.  The point is that slow part of opscan voting &ndash;
filling out the ballot &ndash; is done away from the machine.
On the DRE the slow part is done at the machine.
</li>
</ol>
Optical scan machines are currently the most popular type in the USA
probably for exactly these reasons &ndash; but
DRE machines are the most popular type among people trying to <i>sell</i> us
these machines so they can make lots of money, also for exactly these reasons.
(Read <a href="MiamiDadePC.html">story</a>
of Florida's  Miami-Dade County,  which got suckered into buying DRE machines from ES&amp;S
and now wants to discard them all and switch to optical scan as the cheapest way out
of the mess they got themselves into.  Later note:
It <a href="FLswitch.html">now appears</a> as though
Florida will be switching over to optical-scan statewide and abandoning all its DRE machines.)
However, the USA is unfortunately an
outrageous  totally
nonuniform <a href="VotSystMap.html">crazy quilt</a> of different machine
types and standards.
</p>

<H3> What about Condorcet and IRV? </H3>

<p>
Sorry, considerably fewer kinds of present-day voting machines can handle them.
</p>

<p>
You might <i>naively</i> think something like
"optical scan machines are just an optical input device connected to a computer.
Therefore, we can program it to perform any kind of election.
Unlike, say, mechanical-counter based lever machines, which can only be used
for additive kinds of elections, such as range, approval, and plurality."
</p>

<p>
However, the truth is messier.
See, the great advantage of mechanical lever machines is precisely that they do
<i>not</i>
contain computers and therefore tampering is fairly hard to do and easy to
detect.
(Low-tech is better, many voting advocates say, and we think with some justification...)
</p>

<p>
Now for this reason, we think many punch card machines and optical scan
machines are intentionally designed <i>not</i> to have computers,
i.e. to have counters, mechanical or electromechanical or
hardwired electrical.  Or if they do have computers, they are designed
to be computers ultrahard to reprogram, e.g. soldered-in
single chip computers with 
program in built-in ROM.
(Perhaps somebody knows more
than I do re that? Help appreciated.)
</p>

<p>
If you want to know the answers to these questions for any particular machine type,
good luck.
Basically, the voting machine manufacturers <a href="VMLies.html">lie constantly</a> and make up
different stories depending who they think is listening. 
(Check this about how their <a href="AviRubinITA.html">creation of the myth</a>
of "independent testing authorities" for voting machines, and 
<a href="DieboldSuit.html">this</a> about a lawsuit against Diebold Inc. for telling lies.)
If they think the listener wants security and incredible tamperproofness, meet story number 1...
So you generally cannot
trust what they say. There are numerous examples of that.
</p>

<p>
For IRV, the situation is even <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">worse still</a>.
Even if your machines have computers, and even if those computers are
totally programmable, then those machines <i>still</i> cannot handle counting
IRV votes, <i>unless</i> they are all connected together in a giant network,
or unless just one machine <i>has</i> all
the votes, i.e. all the ballots in the whole state
are first shipped to a single central counting agency.
(That is
because, in IRV, one machine needs to know the totals from all the <i>others</i>
just in order to count its <i>own</i> personal stash of votes.  In  contrast, in
Range voting, a machine can total its own personal stash without knowing anything
about the rest of the world.)
Either way, this is asking for trouble!  Think about this in an
adversarial environment with people demanding recounts and tracking all votes back to 
their original precincts, and other bad people trying to screw up the network.
IRV is an election administrator's nightmare 
waiting to happen.

<b>The bottom line:</b>
We know range and approval can be handled even
by machine types designed only for plurality voting,
that cannot be reprogrammed, that have no computers, that
are not all connected in a network, and that are located in
individual precincts.
Some machine types make this pleasant for the voter, 
other less, but all can do it. 
But Condorcet, Borda, and <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">IRV</a>
cannot be handled unless there is reprogramming
and in the IRV case unless there is networking or centralized counting instead of
precincts
(<a href="CondTot.html">Deeper look</a>).
</p>

<p>
That is a significant
adoptability edge for range and approval and it <i>alone</i> should be enough to convince all
serious voting-reformers to forget about Condorcet, Borda, and IRV.
(Not convinced?  The cost of buying new voting machines USA-wide would be
of order $50 billion.  The cost of buying such machines for just <i>one</i> typical
<i>county</i> far exceeds the entire 
nationwide budgets all of the USA's "third parties" <i>combined</i>.  
Based on this monetary comparison: Who do you think
has more power &ndash; voting machine stick-in-the-muds, or voting-method reformers?)
