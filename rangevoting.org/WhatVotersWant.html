<H1> What Voters Want &ndash; score voting seems their favorite </H1>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, May 2013.</small></p>
<p>
Collected here &ndash; for the first time ever! &ndash;
is convincing evidence, based on high quality polls, 
about what voting systems real voters do and do not want.
By "convincing," we mean
"of comparable or greater clarity than (what are normally regarded as) the
greatest-ever popular-vote <a href="ElMargins.html">landslides</a> in USA presidential election history,"
which (we remind the reader) were about 61% super-majorities or, if instead reckoned 
by the <i>difference</i> &Delta; 
between the winner's and  2nd-placer's vote counts, &Delta;&asymp;25%
of the number of voters.
</p><p>
<b>Here are the answers.</b> Let "A<b>&gt;</b>B" mean "there is convincing evidence that
voters prefer voting system A over voting system B."
</p><blockquote>
<b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting <b>&gt;</b> Instant Runoff Voting (IRV).
</p><p>

<h3> The evidence </h3>

<p>
<b>1.</b>
There is convincing poll evidence from UK, Australia, San Francisco,
and BC Canada
that voters do <i>not</i> want IRV (instant runoff, several flavors) 
or the related but more complicated 
STV system, if choice is between IRV &amp; plain plurality voting.
</p>
<p>
AUSTRALIA October 2010: A nationwide professional telephone 
<a href="assets/documents/AustraliaNewsPollVoteStudy.pdf">poll</a> 
by "Newspoll" (see question #9)
of 1202
random Australian adults found that they prefer plain-plurality
voting versus the preferential (instant runoff) system Australians presently
use to elect their House. If forced to choose one, they'd choose to
abandon IRV &ndash; the poll's result was 57% to 37% (with 5% don't
know/refuse; this is 60:40 if the "don't knows" are ignored).  
<!-- most precisely: irv=6191 plur=9551 dunno=907 -->
IRV flavor:
In most of Australia, voting is compulsory (nonvoters pay fine) and ranking
<i>all</i> candidates also is compulsory.  However, in some of Australia, voters
are allowed to rank fewer candidates if desired.
</p><p>
A closer look: Plurality enjoyed greater support than IRV in every geographic area,
every income level, both genders, and all marital and parenthood statuses.  
However, there were some
demographic subgroups which preferred IRV, namely: young, university educated, and members of
Green Party and a few more-minor and obscure political groups.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Australian poll question wording:</b>
Currently, elections for the Federal House of Representatives, or lower house, use a preferential
voting system. This is where voters indicate an order of preferences for all candidates, and 
these preferences are taken into account when deciding which candidate wins. 
(PAUSE). 
An alternative system would be "first past the post", where voters only vote for one 
candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. Would you personally prefer...? 
READ OUT (PROG. NOTE: SINGLE RESPONSE, RANDOMISE 1-2, THEN 3 LAST):
<table>
<tr><td>1</td><td>A preferential system</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A first past the post system</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>DO NOT READ: Neither / don't know</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote><p>
Note the Australian poll result even could be regarded as showing voters are against <i>every</i> 
rank-order-ballot voting system, not merely IRV.  That would be absolutely devastating to
the entire political science voting system literature before the year 2000 &ndash;
good job that literature studiously omits mention of this poll.
</p><p>
MORE ON AUSTRALIA.
Antony Green (who often does election commentating for ABC, Australian Broadcasting Co.)
wanted to dispute my above poll.  To do so, he found two earlier polls by
Roy Morgan Research in the years 1974 and 1984 (he says information about them was published in
"The Bulletin," 12 Feb 1985):
<pre>
     <b><u>Roy Morgan Research 1974</u>       <u>Roy Morgan Research 1984</u></b>
     first past post   53           first past post   54 
     preferential      38           preferential      39 
     undecided         9            undecided         7 %
</pre>
which seem entirely to support exactly my same conclusion &ndash; Australians prefer
plurality voting over preferential ballot systems, by large margins!
(Incidentally, the top 4 polling companies in Australia are Roy Morgan, Newspoll, Nielsen,
and Galaxy Research, probably in descending order.)  Undeterred, Green then announced that 
<i>all three</i> 
of these polls found the wrong conclusion!   How could Green possibly dispute all
three (agreeing, large-margin, respected pollster) polls from different pollsters
at different times (when Green had no other such polls)??
Well, Green's argument was long and convoluted, but essentially this:
<blockquote><small>
At all 3 poll times, something political was going on in Australia, and 
therefore voters supposedly interpreted the questions as some kind of 
referendum, not on which voting system, but rather on their opinion of 
that one-time political phenomenon.  Even though the poll questions never mentioned one
word about that political phenonemenon, nor about any Australian political party. 
And by pure coincidence, all those three times, the Australians who thus 
misinterpreted the question always managed by pure bad luck to come 
out with roughly the same deceptive poll result every time, and this 
bad luck just kept happening, thus preventing the True View, which 
Green Alone Knows, and no poll supported, from coming to light: namely, really,
Australians prefer preferential voting.
And, the <a href="http://www.ipa.org.au/about">IPA</a> ("institute for public affairs"), 
which paid for the 2010 Newspoll, was in Green's view 
a biased organization, which (he tried to insinuate) must have meant they bribed Newspoll to 
fake their results, or something. [Unlike Green himself &ndash; he's not biased.]
Of course, at <i>any</i> time, something political is <i>always</i> happening in Australia, so
one might presume that no matter how many such polls there are repeating the findings
of the above three, Green would continue to dispute them all for the same reason?
Perhaps not, because Green further supported his views by providing political-party-liking
breakdowns of the YES and NO pollees in those three polls.
(These breakdowns were given by him 
without even a single calculation of a single statistical significance number.)
Green noted that these breakdowns <i>differed</i>, 
and in ways which, he thought, somehow proved his point.  
Of course during the 37 years 1974 to 2010 one might naturally have expected 
these party breakdowns to time-evolve regardless of
the correctness of Green's theory (e.g. entire political parties were born during this span...),
but he never mentioned that possibility.
Finally, in 2013, Green found a fourth poll, which, he contended (for some reason), 
now was not merely a victim of
temporary political circumstances, but actually revealing the truth:
</small></blockquote>
<p>
POLL QUESTION  ("Essential Media" 11 July 2011 through 14 January 2013):<br>
Which of the following voting systems would you prefer when voting 
for the Federal House of Representatives?
<ol type="A"><li> &nbsp;
A preferential voting system where voters rank all candidates in 
order of preference. 
</li><li> &nbsp;
An optional preferential system where voters can rank one, some, 
or all candidates in order of preference. 
</li><li> &nbsp;
A "first past the post" system, where voters only vote for one 
candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. 
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that this poll question is worded quite differently from the preceding three.
It offers <i>three</i> response-options, not just two.
<!-- and it specifically mentions 
the Australian "Federal House of Representatives" (but not, say, the Senate or 
provincial legislatures) while
the Roy Morgan polls apparently had not mentioned any particular political 
body and were just speaking generally(?). -->
Green claimed this was the first poll ever, to offer these
three options.   Note that this poll question is badly designed &ndash; for precisely the same
reason that plurality voting is a poor voting system for 3-candidate elections! &ndash;
namely, we have 3 options, 2 of which might (at least naively) seem near-clones, leading
to the risk of unclear, hard-to-interpret, "vote-splitting" phenomena.  
It would have been far better to, e.g, design the poll as a rating question, e.g. "for each option,
give a number from 0-100 saying how much you like it."   
(Or, if you insist on a plurality-style poll, then at least make it 
<i>symmetric</i> by having <i>two</i>
first-past-post options, one with mandatory and one with optional voting.)
But because perhaps the pollster in this case
was <i>not</i> one of the most-respected polling companies in Australia (listed above) but rather 
the little known firm <a href="http://www.essential-media.com/aboutus">Essential Media</a>
(via subsidiary <a href="http://essentialresearch.com.au/">Essential research</a>)
which as of year 2014 does not even mention "polling" as one of its corporate activities, it
did not.  Also, it should be noted that this poll was conducted <i>online</i>,
unlike the previous polls by Newspoll (telephone) and Roy Morgan (face to face interviews),
and over a 1&frac12;-year span, not a short period.
Online polls are much harder to do well (due to sample bias self-selection effects 
&ndash; the most 
obvious being that those without internet access, are uncounted) than
telephone &amp; in person polls, hence are generally regarded with suspicion or as experimental
at this time &ndash;
especially if done by a non-well-established polling firm that hasn't had many years
to refine its online techniques via comparisons with other polling methods.
In any case, the results (1878 respondents) were
<pre>
    <b>A:</b> 22%,       <b>B:</b> 26%,        <b>C:</b> 44%,     <b>Don't know:</b> 7%.
</pre>
This, Green contended, finally showed the Truth that Australians prefer a preferential system,
since A+B combined outweigh "first past the post" by 48-44.
Unfortunately, Green's interpretation is dubious.  First, this 4% margin is far smaller than
all three of the margins (20%, 15%, 15%) going the other way in the preceding polls conducted
using more-reliable techniques by more experienced pollsters with non-stupidly-designed
poll questions.  Second, if, say, a mere 1/5 of the "B" respondents preferred C over A
as their (unstated) 2nd and 3rd choice options,
then adding 22+26 to get 48 would be unjustified (it's only justified if
100% of the B's prefer A&gt;C, and 100% of the A's prefer B&gt;C), 
and then instead of the so-called 48-44 margin,
the real margin would be
in the <i>other direction</i>, i.e. now indicating Australians prefer
Plurality (first past post) voting!
If, further, 1/5 of the A's preferred C&gt;B, then the margin would be
at least 49-43 
in favor of first past post!
Are these "1/5"s realistic possibilities?
Certainly, in view of the 3 previous polls.  
(Also, just in view of the fact 4:1 or larger margins in poll questions, are rare.)
Also, we should point out that in real life, Australians do not get to use
"system A or B, whichever you prefer."  They are forced to use <i>just one</i> preferential
voting system (whichever the law demands in their location), 
often not the version they like best.  If asked to choose between 
just it and first-past-post,
this poll would seem again to indicate Australians would select the latter.

UNITED KINGDOM (Britain &amp; N.Ireland): A 5 May 2011 binding nationwide 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011">referendum</a>
asked voters to decide whether the
UK should switch from plurality to IRV voting (called in both Australia and Britain
"the alternative vote").
The flavor proposed for the UK (oh sorry, make that "flavour") 
would have allowed voters to rank as many or as few candidates as they wanted.
The result was a massive landslide victory (68% to 32% of the 19.3 million votes) for "stay
with plurality."  
<!-- precise results: irv=6152607 plur=13013123 turnout=42.2% -->
</p><p>
A closer look:
Plurality won in every one of the 12 geographic regions, the smallest
victory being by 56.32% in N.Ireland, with all others exceeding 60.47%.
(Probably related to:
N.Ireland is adjacent to Ireland, which has long used IRV to elect president.)
Unofficial professional polls indicate it also won in both genders, in every age group
except 18-24, and in every political subgroup except LibDem.
Voting in the UK is not compulsory (nor would it have become so), 
and indeed the turnout for this referendum was 42.2%.
It also should be noted that, although voter and proponent understanding on
both sides could easily be criticized, this referendum was undoubtably
the greatest education-and-debate effort ever conducted about a choice between
voting systems.
</p><blockquote>
<b>UK referendum's wording:</b>
At present, the UK uses the "first past the post" system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. 
Should the "alternative vote" system be used instead?

BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA 12 May 2009: In a binding province-wide
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_electoral_reform_referendum,_2009">referendum</a>, 
"switch to BC-STV" (from plain plurality) 
lost with only 39.09% of the 1.65 million votes cast.
(55% turnout.)
The proposed BC-STV system involved "votes" which were
rank-orderings of the candidates; each voter being allowed to rank as many 
or as few of the candidates as desired.  The algorithm for computing the winners from
the votes is more complicated than IRV, involving "reweightings" as well as "transfers."
</p><blockquote>
<b>BC referendum's wording:</b>
Which electoral system should British Columbia use to elect members to the provincial Legislative Assembly?

Assembly on Electoral Reform.

SAN FRANCISCO, USA: 
In a 5 March 2002 referendum (31% turnout), voters decided 
(by 55-45 margin)
to switch from a 2-round genuine runoff system to
a 1-round instant runoff voting system.
It was first used in SF's Nov. 2004 elections.
As a result, at the time of this writing (2013) San Francisco has more IRV 
experience than any other US city.
Why did SF's voters go for IRV? 
It may have had something to do with the fact that the official referendum ballot question
contained a <a href="assets/images/SF-IRVballotScan.png">lie</a>.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Official question wording:</b>
Shall the City use Instant run-off voting to elect City officers <i>with a majority 
of votes</i> without separate run-off elections?  (YES / NO).
</blockquote>
<!-- SF PropA precise results: irv=76240, T2R=61261, yesIRV=55.48%, turnout=31% 
total valid voters=133901 -->
<p>
Note the words we've italicized.  They are a lie.  <a href="IrvRevFail.html#nomajwinner">IRV</a>, 
especially the <a href="IRV3.html">IRV3</a> rules SF 
adopted, does <a href="IrvExhaustionSF.html">not</a> 
<a href="IRVpereira.html">ensure</a> that those elected have a majority.  
(Indeed: after passage, IRV elections were duly held in SF, 
and indeed elected many people who did not have majorities.)
Further, it can happen that a candidate who really is majority-preferred versus every rival
(such as Montroll in 
 <a href="Burlington.html">Burlington Vermont's IRV mayoral election of 2009</a>)
loses with IRV.
The wording also is deceptive in the sense that with the old genuine-runoff system, 
if anybody had a majority 
(50%+1 vote), then the "separate run-off" 2nd round automatically would not happen.
This wording created the erroneous impression that was not the case,
and that IRV would "repair" this "flaw."   It really was an outrage that this question-wording
was even permitted. 
</p><p>
But anyhow, either because of this official-wording lie or for
some other reason, SF's voters went for it.  But 
here's what happened in February 2011, 
when SF Chamber of Commerce hired David Binder Research to 
<a href="assets/documents/CityBeatPoll2011results.pdf">poll</a> 500 SF voters
to see what they now thought (with the benefit of 9 years of <b>hindsight</b>)
&ndash; and then again for a 
<a href="assets/documents/CityBeatPoll2012results.pdf">re-poll</a> on the same question
in February 2012 (after 10 years hindsight):

Note that these poll results are in the opposite direction and both have a greater margin than
the original enactment vote, and each is statistically fairly significant 
(<a href="NHack.html">confidence</a>&ge;98% that IRV loses) with the 
combined confidence (i.e. based on both polls together)
exceeding 99.999995%.  The margin if "don't know"s are ignored is 60-40 in favor of
"go back to the old genuine-runoff system."

NEW ZEALAND 26 Nov. 2011:
Voters were asked (in a nationwide non-binding 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_voting_system_referendum,_2011">referendum</a>)
whether to get rid of their present MMP system and replace it with something else.
Whether to keep MMP was question #1, and "keep MMP" won with 57.77% of the vote.
About 2.2 million voted in this referendum (about 74% turnout).
</p><p>
More interesting for our purposes, was question #2, which was 
"assuming 'abolish MMP' wins in question #1, then what?"  The voters were offered 4 choices:
</p><ol>
<li>
Plain plurality voting (called in NZ "first past the post")
</li><li>
instant runoff voting (IRV, but in NZ called the "preferential" system)
</li><li>
An STV multiwinner system (similar to IRV but 
more complicated due to reweightings as well as transfers...)
</li><li>
"Supplementary member" (SM) system rather related to MMP.
</li></ol>
The results were:  "Plain plurality" won by landslide with 46.66% of the vote,
versus IRV (12.47%), STV (16.73%), and SM (24.14%).
Admittedly since this was a 4-choice vote, we, technically speaking, 
do not have here a direct comparison between plain plurality versus IRV.
However, with plain plurality way in first place and IRV in last place it nevertheless
looks fairly clear New Zealand voters prefer the former.
And they know something of what they speak
because IRV has actually been used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_City_mayoral_election,_2016">elect</a>, 
e.g, the mayor of Wellington (NZ's second largest city, and capital).
</p><p>
A 16 June 2011 Research New Zealand poll asked "Supposing the choice was between MMP as it is 
and the old First Past the Post system, which would you prefer?" and MMP won with 49% versus 
FPP with 33% 
(the rest were "neither," "don't know," or refused).  Same preference for every ethnicity, 
gender, and income range surveyed.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 1900-2013:
As far as I know as of 2013 there has never been a nationwide 
or statewide "switch to IRV" referendum.  But there have been many such referenda in cities, towns 
and occasionally counties (as well as "abolish IRV" referenda in 
places where they'd enacted IRV earlier). I have not done a precise count, but I believe
that IRV has lost more USA referenda than it won.  More precisely, I believe about 90% 
of the times IRV or a closely related system got enacted throughout USA history, 
it later was repealed in a follow-up referendum; plus there
were many cases where "enact IRV" referenda were defeated.
Although that was only an educated guess by me, the following is
</p>
<center>
<b>
FACT:
If all the "IRV versus plain plurality" referendums ever held in world history (up to now, 2013)
are added together,
then the "plain plurality" side wins by a large margin.
</b>
</center>
<p>
basically because the British referendum vote-count overwhelms all the others combined.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b>
There is landslide poll evidence voters do <i>not</i> want "majority
judgment" with 7-point verbal scale, if choosing between it and
present French 2-round plurality plus 2nd round runoff system.
</p><p>
FRANCE 6-7 April 2011:
A professional nationwide <a href="assets/documents/Sondageopinionway2012FR.pdf">poll</a>
of 1000 French was conducted asking the voters to score the projected candidates for
the April 2012 presidential election on the 7-point verbal scale
</p><center>
Excellent / Tres bien / Bien / Assez Bien / Passable / Insuffisant / a Rejeter.
</center><p>
and provided them with an oversimplified (but otherwise well-written) 
1-page description of the MJ voting method.
They also were asked to vote using the normal ("name one candidate") French method.
(We report the <a href="France2012.html">results</a> elsewhere.)
After completing those voting tasks, the pollees were asked <i>which</i> voting method
they preferred:
<ul><li>
Traditional (plurality plus 2nd round runoff):  63%
</li><li>
MJ (median-based with verbal 7-point scale):  36%
</li><li>
Other/don't know:   1%
</li></ul>

<p>
<b>3.</b> Academics conducted several studies of
approval voting and several flavors of score voting in three French towns (as "exit polls" with
government funding and assistance) during the 2012 presidential
election.  
2340 voters 
participated in this voting study, which was 54% of the voters at the official
polling places they used.  However, some only participated partially, 
i.e. not answering every question.
</p><p>
All the voting methods in these studies (as well as the official election) 
produced the same winner: Hollande.  (We discuss the <a href="France2012.html">results</a> elsewhere.)
</p><p>
I'm mainly relying on this July 2012
academic <a href="assets/documents/France1220.pdf">paper</a> 
(in French, by
A.Baujard, F.Gavrel, H.Igersheim, J-F.Laslier, I.Lebon).
For our purpose here, the important thing is that
a <i>questionnaire</i> was appended to the ballots used in this voting study.
85.9% of the pollees opted to answer the questionnaire.
<!-- (80-95% response rates to these additional questions.)-->
</p><p>
QUESTION 1 asked which kinds of voting they wanted. 1958 answered.
The 4 choices were:
</p><ol type="I">
<li>
Les  deux regles (meaning, both
approval and score voting should be used)  27.53%
</li><li>
Vote par approbation  ("approval voting") 29.47%
</li><li>
Vote par note ("score voting") 32.84%  &nbsp; <small>WINNER!!</small>
</li><li>
Aucune des deux ("neither of them")  10.11%
</li></ol>
<p>
<small>
Incidentally, elsewhere 
in that same paper the official 2-round plurality (with 2-man runoff if needed) 
system was described as
"Vote uninominal a deux tours (officiel)."
</small>
</p><p>
Note, there are 4 "binary" possibilities here, namely 00, 01, 10, and 11
where the first bit is "want score voting?" and the second is "want approval?", perhaps best
displayed in tabular form as
</p><table bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><td></td><th bgcolor="pink">Want score</th><th bgcolor="pink">Do not want score</th></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="pink">Want approval</th><td align="center" bgcolor="lightgreen">27.53%</td><td align="center" bgcolor="lightgreen">29.47%</td><td>57.00%</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="pink">Do not want approval</th><td align="center" bgcolor="lightgreen">32.84%</td><td align="center" bgcolor="lightgreen">10.11%</td><td>42.95%</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="center">60.37%</td><td align="center">39.58%</td></tr>
</table>
</p><p>
The most generous interpretation would be that an overwhelming
89.89% of the voters want at least one of {score, approval} voting.
However, some would argue that their question 1 was poorly worded. 
<!--
It could have been worded in a <i>much</i> clearer and simpler way as, e.g. two binary
questions??
-->
<a name="q2a2b">So</a>
probably more clear and convincing for us were questions 2a and 2b:
</p><p>
QUESTION 2a:
asked for which kinds of elections the <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting system
should be used (or not).  4 subquestions:
</p><pre>
    Elections presidentielles:  61%.
    Elections legislatives:     57%.
    Elections municipales:      61%.
    Associations:               52%.
  (Average of above numbers)    58%
</pre><p>
QUESTION 2b asked for which kinds of elections the 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting system
should be used (or not).  Same 4 subquestions:
</p><pre>
    Elections presidentielles:  62%.
    Elections legislatives:     55%.
    Elections municipales:      66%.
    Associations:               51%.
  (Average of above numbers)    59%
</pre><p>
Note that a majority of respondents prefer either 
&ndash; versus France 2011's official systems &ndash;
for <i>every</i> purpose, and 61% is
comparable to the largest ever USA presidential "landslides" while
90% (question 1, generous interpretation) is far greater.
</P><p><b>What about possible biases in these exit-poll studies?</b>
In case you are worried that those who opted to 
answer the questionnaire were a biased subsample of the
poll-respondents, keep in mind that even if <i>every</i> no-questionnaire pollee were
against score voting, that still would not have been enough to swing any &ge;59%
result for score voting.
If you are worried the 54% of the official voters who chose to participate in the study
were a biased subsample of "all voters,"
then keep in mind the exit polls are regarded as the most 
<a href="PollAccurRecord.html">accurate</a> kind of poll,
54% is a very high participation rate for an exit poll, and 2340 pollees
is regarded (by pollsters in the year 2012) as an unusually large poll;
and finally we can <i>check</i> how biased these 54% were by comparing their votes with the
known official vote counts for the full 100% of the voters at the studied locations.
Unfortunately only 1345 study participants out of 2340 (57%) agreed to reveal their official vote,
leading to <i>additional</i> selection effects which hurt our checking ability!
Anyhow, to perform that check, just compare the last two rows of Table 3.1 in the paper, which
we re-give below:
</p><pre>
                  Hollnd  Sarkozy  LePen  Mlnchon  Bayrou  Joly  Dpnt-Agnn  Poutou  Arthaud  Chemnd
Official results   33.16   22.31   12.57   13.54   11.60   3.61   1.56       0.97     0.57    0.12 
Study results (%)  41.11   14.37    5.87   16.62   13.37   5.95   1.16       1.00     0.15    0.39
</pre><p>
So it would appear the study-participants (at least the ones who revealed their official votes!)
were more pro-Hollande and more anti-Sarkozy and 
anti-LePen than the full voter set at those locations, and these three discrepancies are
statistically significant (although the discrepancies for the other 7 candidates tabulated may
not be).   These three discrepancies were 41.11-33.16=7.95%, 22.31-14.37=7.94%, and
12.57-5.87=6.70% of the voters, i.e. 7.95+7.94+6.70=22.59% in all.   If we 
model these as 22.6% of the study voters were 'strange' and the remaining 77.4% 'normal' and
if we (to play it safe) assume the strange voters were voting 70-30 in favor
of approval/score voting, then even if we were to remove all those strange voters,
then still, score-voting would be winning by a comfortable margin &ndash; no longer 59%,
but over 54%.  (Indeed, you'd need to assume the strange voters were 90-10 in order
to overturn Score's win.  That seems very implausible.)
</p><p>
So in short: even after taking into account 
possible flaws in the poll sample, and even doing so in a pretty pessimistic way,
score voting still clearly wins.
</p><p>
A closer look: actually this academic study trialed three
<i>different</i> score voting systems, one in each of the 3 towns:
</p><pre>
     TOWN...........#POLLED.........TYPE OF SCORE VOTING TRIALED
     Louvigny.........930..............{-1, 0, +1}  check one of three boxes for each candidate
     St.Etienne.......387...............{0, 1, 2}   check one of three boxes for each candidate
     Strasbourg......1023..........{0, 1, 2, ..., 19, 20}   write two digits for each candidate
</pre><p>
And the results of question 2b (when examined town by town) 
show there was <i>clearly more support</i>
for {-1,0,+1} and {0,1,2} than for {0,1,2,...,19,20}  but in contrast
question 2a got about the same support rates in all 3 towns.
Indeed, in Strasbourg, the town using
{0,1,2,...,19,20} score voting, <i>alone</i>,
the 802 responses to QUESTION 1 were
</p><ol type="I">
<li>
Les  deux regles 25.81%
</li><li>
Vote par approbation  35.29%
</li><li>
Vote par note  28.43%
</li><li>
Aucune des deux 10.47%
</li></ol>
<p>
indicating approval voting was actually preferred over 
{0,1,2,...,19,20} score, even though with the full distribution of 
score-sets used, overall score was preferred versus approval <i>despite</i>
the handicap that 44% of the pollees were in Strasbourg.
</p><p>
<b>The lesson</b> of that is that score voting <i>with the most-popular score-set</i>
will be even <i>more</i> supported.  Unfortunately we do not currently know what that set is,
although the authors of the study conjecture {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2} ought
to be more popular than the three sets they tried.  (We elsewhere have
<a href="RateScaleResearch.html">some data</a> about what scales are liked/not, suggesting
a 10-level scale is most wanted.)

<h3> A cautionary tale: Compulsory voting </h3>

<p>
Question #10 of the same Oct. 2010 Australian 
<a href="assets/documents/AustraliaNewsPollVoteStudy.pdf">poll</a> 
asked whether Australian voting 
should continue to be <b>compulsory</b>, or should become voluntary. 
Result: compulsory=69%, voluntary=29%, neither/don't know=2%. Compulsory won
in every economic, age, educational, and
geographic demographic subgroup, and also in every political subgroup
<i>except</i> for "non-voters" where it only got 49% support.
</p><p>
That seems pretty clear.  There is just one problem:
</p><p>
This result was virtually the exact <i>opposite</i> of that found in
a 2-6 June 2004 ABC News poll of 1001 <b>USA</b> adults:
72% opposed a law that would require all eligible citizens to vote
in national elections and levy a small fine on non-voters 
who do not have a good excuse for skipping the polls. 
Only 21% said the law would be a good idea.
"Non-compulsory" won in every USA demographic subgroup investigated.
[And this 2004 result was almost identical to the results from Gallup polls in 1965, when 69%
opposed such a law.]
<!-- http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=120577&page=1#.UYrLp-DFXUI -->
</p><p>
The <b>lesson</b>  of that contradiction is this: different countries can yield different 
conclusions.  The Australians, who for their entire lives had had compulsory voting, felt
differently than the Americans who, for <i>their</i> entire lives had had 
<i>non</i>compulsory voting.
</p><p>
But that seems exceptional.  In the case of IRV (issue #1 above) we've given polls
from several countries including ones with a long history of IRV use and ones with a long history
of IRV non-use.  In the case of score and approval voting, I do not see why France and 
(say) the USA should have any great disparity on this, and in the case of MJ,
presumably France would be expected to be more pro-MJ than the USA (since MJ had been
highly and favorably publicized there) but MJ still lost by landslide in France.
</p>
<h3> A less-convincingly supported election USA reform: 
change election day from Tuesday to Weekend </h3>
<p>
POLL QUESTION:
Some people have suggested that election day should be changed from
Tuesday to an entire weekend so that people would be able to vote on
either Saturday or Sunday. Do you think this is a good idea or a bad
idea?
</p>
<p><small>
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute,
275 Mount Carmel Avenue
Hamden, CT 06518-1940.
NY field date 6-12 Feb, NJ field date 30 Jan-5 Feb, both in 2001.
Method: telephone.
Sample Sizes: NY=1412, NJ=1156.
</small>
</p>
<table bgcolor="orange">
<tr><td></td><th bgcolor="pink" colspan="3" >New York</th><th>New Jersey</th><th bgcolor="pink">Combined</th></tr>

<p>
Unfortunately this was not a nationwide poll, it was only
a poll within New York state plus another poll within New Jersey state.
</p><p>
That racial disparity is rather interesting.  New York (2010 census) is
65.7% white, 15.9% black, and 18.4% other races (as self-described).
USA-wide is 72.4% white, 12.6% black, and 15.0% other.
(NJ: 72.6% white, 13.6% black, 13.8% other.)
Extrapolation from NY+NJ to USA-wide (discarding don't-know's and using all 3
races) therefore suggests "weekend" would win by about 51.3% to 48.7%.
This is not hugely convincing because putting in statistical
1-standard-deviation error bars, that "51.3%" would really be more
like (51.3&plusmn;1.3)%.
</p><p>
So in summary, this "change to weekend" idea seemed (when polled in 2001) to have
more popular support than "stay tuesday," but not convincingly and not hugely.
