<H2> Other voting systems we advocate (under the right circumstances) </H2>

<p>
Generally speaking, we regard <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
as the best single-winner voting system, for a wide variety of reasons.
</p>

<p>
However, <a href="Approval.html"><b>approval voting</b></a>, 
which is the maximally-simple degenerate special case of
range voting, can for some purposes be superior.
</p>

<H3> Approval voting </H3>

In approval voting, you "approve" of some candidates and "disapprove" of others, and the candidate
approved by the most voters wins.  This has also been called "set voting," because your
vote is the <i>set</I> of candidates you approve.
</p>

<p>
Approval voting is probably the simplest voting system in the world.  It is even simpler
than <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting because there is no rule about
"overvotes" being illegal (and therefore no need to detect overvoters to punish them).
To switch from plurality voting all you need is to change the instruction "vote for one"
to "vote for one or more."  Simple.  Total cost of switching: zero.
</p>

<p>
Range voting seems <a href="AppExec.html">superior</a>
to approval voting because it allows more expressivity
(some candidates can be approved, some "highly approved", some "very very disapproved" etc),
but unfortunately it is more complicated.  Although both approval and range voting can be run
on <a href="VotMach.html">all voting machines</a>, with the worst kinds of voting machines
approval could be significantly easier for voters than range voting.  
</p>

<p>
Also, for use in votes at <i>meetings</i> you can do approval voting by simply raising your
hands (or better, holding a red card in your raised hand) and counting the hands that approve of X.
Trying to do range voting, Borda voting, Condorcet voting, and etc would be far slower
and more error-prone.  Further, plurality voting also is error-prone because there is no
easy way to be sure that some of the 1000 people in that room have not (illegally) voted twice.
That makes it easy to cheat in plurality votes in large meetings &ndash; besides the fact 
plurality is a worse voting system than approval anyhow.
</p>

<p>
We do not actually regard range and approval voting as <i>competing</i> because approval voting is
just a special case of range voting and the two can 
<a href="Why99.html#coexist">peacefully coexist</a>.

A really dramatically original voting system 
was developed by Clarke, Tideman, and Tullock in
the 1960s and 1970s.
It involves <i>secret</i>-ballot
voting with <i>money bids</i> and in some cases, some voters (bidders) will later be
forced to <i>pay</i> some or all of their bid for candidate X, if candidate X wins.  
The formula for determining the payments is very cleverly devised in such a way 
that the <i>best policy</i> (in terms of maximizing personal monetary reward in some
scenario where each election possibility is worth some amount of money to that voter)
for each voter individually is to bid <i>honestly</i>, i.e. to actually state
their honest estimate of their personal money value for that candidate's election.
Then the candidate with the highest summed dollar-amount bid for him, wins.
(Voters can bid different amounts for several candidates; there is no
restriction forcing them to bid for only one.)
</p>

<p>
So if every voter tries greedily to maximize his own personal wealth and happiness
when choosing his vote, the result will be the election of the best possible candidate 
maximizing total money-benefit to all.  This voting system is thus "perfect"!
</p>

<p>
Before you get too excited about the "perfection" of this scheme, though, 
we point out a few problems.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Votes based on paying money are
<a href="USconstitution.txt">unconstitutional</a>
(under the 24th amendment) for governmental elections in the USA.
</li>
<li>
In  elections with <i>few</i> (under 1000?)
voters, the CTT payment formula is such that typically, a
fairly <i>large</i> fraction of the money bid actually
gets extracted from the voters &ndash; large
enough that good non-monetary voting systems will be superior.
(I.e, range voting may make less-good decisions than CTT because it is not "perfect,"
but CTT's improvement in decision-quality
will be outweighed by the money-costs extracted from the voters, so that overall
CTT will be worse for them.)
Therefore CTT can only hope for superiority over good non-monetary
"conventional" voting systems in <i>large</i> elections; in those the Clarke tax payments
(usually) become very small.
</lI>
<li>
The "perfection" of CTT voting is
only true in a mathematical idealized world in which certain assumptions are made.
In reality in most large governmental elections, those assumptions are <i>extremely false</i>.
This will cause enormous "utility distortions" which cause the decision made
by CTT <i>not</i> to be the best for society at all.  I.e. in the
real world, CTT will <i>not</i> provide perfection.    Just how well or badly it will do is
an experimental question with an unknown answer (since no large CTT elections
have ever been conducted) but it is quite plausible it will actually do worse than
"imperfect" but simpler non-monetary conventional systems like range voting.
Therefore CTT can only hope for superiority over the better non-monetary
"conventional" voting systems in elections which are <i>not too large</i>.
I.e, in view of this and the previous point, CTT needs elections of <i>intermediate size</i>.
</li>
<li>
CTT also has problems concerning nonpayment, escrowing, breaching of bid-secrecy, 
the fact that happiness and money are not exactly the same thing, and collusions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In view of all this, it seems to us that CTT voting might work well 
in corporate <i>stockholder votes</i>
in corporations that have between 1000 and 100,000 stockholders, with the voter payments
("Clarke taxes") donated to charity.
For that purpose the US constitution does not forbid CTT, and
the CTT voting system's perfection will actually pretty much happen 
(if the system is designed carefully)
because the mathematical assumptions will in fact then be approximately true in the real world
&ndash;
and, if so, CTT voting will yield the best corporate profits.
But for corporate votes with too few or too many stockholders,
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
with one range vote cast by each share of stock, is
probably better.
</p>

<p>
More generally, <b>corporations</b> that adopt superior voting methods such as range voting
to make hiring decisions at meetings, etc, 
will, slowly but surely,  enjoy steadily compounding advantages
over their rivals that use poor voting methods such as plurality or Borda
because they will, on average, make better decisions &ndash; and this
improvement comes at a cost of zero.
To corporations we say: there is probably no move you can make that will give you this
large an improved competitive advantage over your rivals, that is, at the same time,
this easy and cheap to implement.  (Talk about a no-brainer!)
</p>

<p>
<a href="CTT.html">We discuss CTT voting in far greater detail here</a>,
including making some significant new realizations and improvements that seem
essential for good performance in practice.
</p>

<H3> What if somebody insists on "rank order ballots"? </H3>

<p>
We do not know what is the best voting scheme based on ballots which are
rank-orderings of the candidates.
Quite possibly, no clearly-best such scheme exists.
Every scheme we are aware of does something horrible in at least one 
election-circumstance.
And that is not just due to our ignorance &ndash; there 
are <a href="ArrowThm.html">impossibility theorems</a>
saying that every ranked-ballot scheme (whether anybody has invented it, or not) fails to
satisfy at least one of a list of desirable-sounding
criteria, in some elections.
There just is no ranked-ballot
scheme that clearly is head and shoulders above its rivals.
We are therefore very hesitant to suggest one.
</p>
<p>
There are many problems with the whole idea of rank-order ballots, but they all
<i>fundamentally spring</i> from these two difficulties:
<ol type="a">
<li>
With rank-order ballots, "preference cycles" become possible
such as "A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;A" in this 19-voter example:

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    8
</td>
<td align="center">
B&gt;C&gt;A
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    6
<td align="center">
C&gt;A&gt;B
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    5
<td align="center">
A&gt;B&gt;C
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Meanwhile with range- or approval-voting ballots, cycles simply cannot exist.
</li><li>
With rank-order ballots, the changes you can make to a vote
are "discrete" rather than "continuous".  
You can't smoothly vary your
vote's view of the relative quality of candidates A and B.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, one could optionally permit or forbid <i>equalities</i> in the rank-ordering
(e.g. "A&gt;B=C&gt;D=E&gt;F") and one also could permit or forbid only ranking 
<i>some</i> but not
all of the candidates (e.g. "A&gt;D&gt;F"), 
and these may alter the view of what the best voting system is.
</p>
<p>
However, if you really, really, really push us hard to choose a system, and you insist
(in our view very foolishly) on using <i>rank-order</i> ballots, then 
<a href="SchulzeComplic.html">Schulze beatpaths</a> and
<a href="TidemanRev.html#wbsirv">WBS-Irv</a> 
seem tolerably decent attempts to
save you from yourself.  
</p>

<a name="multi"></a>
<H3> What about <i>multi</i>winner elections? </H3>

<p>
(For example, electing a "committee" of 5 people from 23 candidates.)
</p>

<p>
The trouble with naively applying some scheme designed for single-winner elections
(such as range or plurality voting) to the committee-problem, is the
quality of a committee is
not about just the sum of the perceived qualities of its members.  It is
also about diversity.
</p>

<p>
For example, if an electorate contains 51% Whigs and 49% Tories,
then using either range, plurality, approval, or instant-runoff
voting with the top 5 scorers being elected,
we might well elect a 100%-Whig committee!  
We don't recommend that.
It would probably be better to elect 3 Whigs and 2 Tories.
</p>

<p>
That is the goal of <a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>
systems.
</p>

<p>
It is much harder to compare multiwinner systems than it is to compare single-winner 
systems, because for the latter problem we have the 
powerful <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> yardstick available.
Also, multiwinner systems have been less investigated.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, we do have two such systems to recommend:
</p>
<a name="asset"></a>
<ul>
<li>
<a  href="RRV.html">Reweighted range voting</a> is a variant of range voting designed for use
in multiwinner elections and which obeys a proportionality theorem.
We believe it is superior to, simpler than, and obsoletes, <i>all</i> "single transferable vote"
systems (except perhaps in very small hand-counted elections, where the latter might
be quicker to count).
</li>
<li>
<b><a href="Asset.html">Asset voting</a></b>
is an "unconventional" voting system in which <i>both</i> 
the voters and the candidates participate.  (Warning: this bothers a lot of people,
and also it prevents asset voting from being used <i>at all</i> in abstract scenarios with 
candidates that are not people, such as voting to choose pizza flavors.)
Asset voting has been proven to be (in terms of certain criteria) superior to <i>any</i>
"conventional" system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These two systems are described in
papers 77 &amp; 78, and 
multiwinner systems generally are
surveyed in paper 91,
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>.
</p>

<a name="asset"></a>
<p>
Asset voting is simple enough that we can describe it here in full:
</p>

<p>
<b>Asset voting to elect W winners from C candidates, 0 &lt; W &lt; C:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In a C-candidate asset election,
each vote is a real C-vector (i.e list of C numbers), 
each entry of which is nonnegative
and with all the entries summing to 1.
For example a legal vote would be (0.4, 0.3, 0, 0.3)
in a 4-candidate election, since 0.4+0.3+0+0.3=1.
</li><li>
Compute the sum-vector S, that is, the list of
each of the C candidates' totals.
</li><li>
Now regard each S<sub>n</sub> as
the amount of an "asset" now owned by candidate <i>n</i>.
The candidates now negotiate; any subset
of them may redistribute their assets among themselves.
</li><li>
After all negotiations and redistributions end, the W "wealthiest"
candidates win.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<small>
In variants, only certain kinds of redistributions are permitted, for example the
candidates in increasing order of "wealth" drop out, redistributing their assets among
the remaining ones as they do so.  
This "poorest first"
variant has the advantage that it forces the procedure to
<i>end</i> quickly and everybody <i>knows</i> when it has ended.
Forest Simmons recommends that
electorates that don't want to deal with any ballots other than
Plurality style ballots, should use a <b>simpler</b> version of Asset Voting or
that uses only Plurality-style ("name one candidate") ballots (the named
candidate gets 100% of that voter's assets).
