<h2> Open Letter to Roger Ailes &amp; Fox News: Use 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>  and 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting polls </h2>
<p>

<p>
The first Republican Primary Debate (hosted by Fox News) is rapidly approaching.
Who should debate?  That (Fox said) would be decided by using standings in 5 nationwide polls.
</p><p>
<i>But</i> the most-commonly used voting method, <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting,
is highly unsuited to polling elections of this kind.  It will yield extremely distorted results.
There are two much better voting methods unfortunately not currently used by the USA 
(general elections) or the Republican Party for its primary:
&quot;<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting&quot;
and
&quot;<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting.&quot;
</p><blockquote>
<b>Plurality:</b> Each voter names exactly one candidate, then shuts up, i.e. is not allowed
to say anything about how much she likes or dislikes any of the other candidates.
The most-named candidate wins.
</p><p>
<b>Approval:</b> Each voter "approves" or "disapproves" each candidate.
The candidate with greatest approval/disapproval ratio wins.
</p><p>
<b>Score:</b> Each voter scores each candidate on a fixed scale (for example 0 to 9).
Highest average wins.   
(If a voter chooses not to score certain candidates, their averages are unaffected.)
</blockquote> 
</p><p>
In particular, Donald Trump is "leading" according to all 6 of the most major July US-wide polls we found,
using plurality voting.
But in several polls, Trump is "bottommost" when reckoned using Approval and Score voting (and in
every poll of those kinds we know, he lies in the bottom half of the field), and in particular his 
election chances versus either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would be the <i>worst</i> 
among all Republican candidates!
</p><p>
This massive distortion, leading&harr;bottommost, is caused by the wrong choice of voting system: 
Plurality is agreed by virtually all experts in voting methods to be one of the worst.
(At the Voting Procedures workshop, Normandy, July 2010, Plurality
was unanimously voted by the participants to be the worst among 18 methods.)
</p><p>
Fortunately several approval and score voting style US-wide polls have already been conducted &ndash;
see <a href="Trump2015.html">This Review</a>.
You can and should use them right now to help decide who should debate.
If you announce that, then Fox News will be
</p><ol><li>
Helping the Republican Party.
If the flawed Plurality system causes Republicans to nominate the candidate <i>least</i> likely to win the 
General, something is wrong.  Help fix that.
</li><li>
Advancing democracy.  For the first time, a major news organization will be announcing what
voting methods experts have been screaming
for decades &ndash; other voting methods are better &ndash;
and saying Fox News
does not intend to remain in the Stone Age.   
</li><li>
Showing Fox and Republicans can be pro-science.  They've been branded as anti-science and against
fair voting; but the branders would not be the ones taking this historic step: Fox would.
</li><li>
Helping the USA and World.  
Computer simulation <a href="BayRegDum.html">studies</a> 
<a href="BayRegsFig.html">indicate</a> if the world's democracies 
switched to score voting, the net <a href="RelImport.html">benefit</a>
would be comparable to, or exceed, inventing 
democracy in the first place.  
<a href="LivesSaved.html">Why</a> isn't the media yelling and screaming that?  Well, that's their
stupidity.  Fox is under no obligation to join it.
</li></ol>
<p>
This move may engender some controversy, but no matter what Fox does, it will be criticized.  
If you are going to get criticized anyway, you might as well actually be <i>right</i>.
If the Republicans adopt Score voting for their primary 
while the Democrats don't, that will 
hurt the Democratic party's election chances for as many years as they continue to resist.
