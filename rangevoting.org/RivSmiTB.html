<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We present three new paper-based voting methods with interesting
security properties. Our goal is to achieve the same security
properties as recently proposed cryptographic voting protocols, but
using only paper ballots and no cryptography.  From a security
viewpoint we get reasonably close, particularly for short ballots.
However, our proposals should probably be considered as more
"academic" than "practical."
</p><p>
In these proposals, not only can each voter verify that her vote is
recorded as intended, but she gets a "receipt"  she can take
home that can be used later to verify that her vote is actually
included in the final tally.  But her receipt does not allow her
to prove to anyone else how she voted.  All ballots cast are scanned
and published in plaintext on a "public bulletin board" (web site), so anyone may
correctly compute the election result.
</p><p>
In ThreeBallot, each voter casts <i>three</i> paper ballots, with
certain restrictions on how they may be filled out.
These paper ballots are of course "voter-verifiable."
</p><p>
A voter receives a copy of <i>one</i> of her ballots as her
"receipt", which she may take home.  Only the voter knows which
ballot she copied for her receipt.  The voter is unable to use her
receipt to prove how she voted or to sell her vote, as the receipt
doesn't reveal how she voted.
</p><p>
A voter can check that the web site contains a ballot matching her
receipt.  Deletion or modification of ballots is thus detectable; so
the integrity of the election is verifiable.
</p><p>
VAV is like ThreeBallot, except that the ballot-marking rules are
different: one ballot may "cancel" another (VAV =
Vote/Anti-Vote/Vote).
VAV is better suited to &ndash; i.e. yields better security properties for &ndash;
Plurality and preference (Borda, Condorcet, IRV) voting, while ThreeBallot is
better suited for Approval and Range voting.
</p><p>
Finally, we introduce "Floating Receipts," wherein
voters may take home a copy of <i>another voter's</i> ballot (but she doesn't
know whose).  Floating Receipts are well-tuned to the
security requirements of ThreeBallot-like schemes, and we examine
protocols for achieving them.
</p><p>
Our final voting system, Twin, is based almost entirely on Floating
Receipts.  Each voter casts a single ballot and takes home a single
receipt.  Twin is quite simple and close to being practical.
</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
Designing secure voting systems is tough, since the constraints are
apparently contradictory.  In particular, the requirement for voter
privacy (no one should know how Alice voted, even if Alice wants them
to know) seems to contradict verifiability (how can Alice verify that
her vote was counted as she intended?).
</p><p>
The proposals presented here are an attempt to satisfy these constraints
<i>without</i> cryptography.  We get pretty close.
</p><p>
As in the cryptographic proposals, the proposals presented here use a
"public bulletin board" (PBB) &ndash; a public web site where election
officials post copies (but now in plaintext) of all of the cast
ballots and a separate list of the names of the voters who voted.  (Some states
might post voter ID's rather than voter names.)
</p><p>
ThreeBallot, VAV, and Twin provide a nice level of end-to-end
verifiability&mdash;the voter gets assurance that her vote was cast as
intended and counted as cast, and that election officials haven't
tampered with the collection of ballots counted.

<h3>Some important single-winner
voting systems <a href="#bib">LevinNa95,Nurmi87</a></h3>
<a name="sec:votmeth"</a>

<p>
Our protocols have different levels of compatibility
with some of the important single-winner voting systems.
So we summarize the latter here.
</p>

<table bgcolor="pink" align="center" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>
Plurality</th><td>
Your vote is the name of one candidate. Most-named candidate wins.
</td></tr><tr><th>
Approval voting <a href="#bib">BramsFi83</a></th><td>
Your vote is the set of candidates you "approve."
Most-approved candidate wins.
</td></tr><tr><th>
Borda voting <a href="#bib">Saari94</a></th><td>
Your vote is a rank-ordering of the <i>C</i> candidates.
A candidate receives <i>C-K</i> points for being ranked <i>K</i>th on
a ballot.  Candidate with the greatest point total ("Borda count") wins.
</td></tr><tr><th>
Condorcet systems</th><td>
Votes are rank-orderings.
If a "Condorcet winner" candidate exists that is preferred pairwise
over each opponent by a majority of the ballots, then he wins.
Otherwise, there are a number of inequivalent techniques that have
been suggested
to determine a winner, and it shall not matter to us which one, provided
it depends only on the <i>C &times; C</i> matrix of pairwise counts.
</td></tr><tr><th>
"Instant runoff" (IRV)</th><td>
Votes are rank-orderings.
The candidate top-ranked on the fewest ballots
is eliminated (from the election, and from all ballots),
reducing it to a <i>(C-1)</i>-candidate election, and the process continues
until only one candidate remains &ndash; the winner.
</td></tr><tr><th>
Range Voting</th><td> 
Your vote for each candidate is an integer
 in some fixed range (e.g. <i>0&hellip; 9</i> for "single digit
range voting").
The candidate with the greatest total score wins.
Approval voting is just range voting
with integer range <i>[0,1]</i>.

</table>

</p><p>
Our secure-voting protocols do the following jobs.
ThreeBallot is intended to handle approval and range voting.
VAV and Twin can handle <i>any</i> 
voting system,
including ones we have not
described such as multiwinner Hare/Droop reweighted STV.
</p>

<h3>2. ThreeBallot</h3>

<p>
We now describe ThreeBallot in more detail.  (An earlier version
of ThreeBallot was posted <a href="#bib">Rivest06</a> in 2006; it contains some
variations and discussion not included here for lack of space, but unfortunately also
some flaws.)
</p>

<h3>Voting in ThreeBallot</h3>

<h3>Checking In at the Poll Site</h3>

<p>
The voter receives a
paper "multi-ballot" to vote with.
A multi-ballot
consists of three paper ballots, printed on separate sheets.
(They could be printed on a single sheet, with perforations
for later separation, but this introduces some unnecessary
security concerns, so we do not recommend this approach.)
</p><p>
We imagine that the poll-site has a bin of pre-printed blank
ballots, and that the voter randomly selects three
to form her multi-ballot.
</p>

<h3>The Multi-Ballot</h3>

<p>
ThreeBallot is perhaps most easily viewed as an extension of
"mark-sense" ("optical scan" or "opscan")
systems <a href="#bib">JonesOptical</a>.
</p><p>
Each ballot in the multiballot is an identical complete ballot;
think of it as a standard opscan ballot with the addition of
a unique coded ballot ID on the bottom of each ballot.  See
Figure <a href="#fig:appMBabcd">&sect;</a>.  The upper voting region lists candidate
names with matching op-scan bubbles that can be filled in (marked).
</p><p>
Each ballot ID is different from other ballot ID's on the multi-ballot
or elsewhere.  The ballot ID's on a multi-ballot are thus unrelated,
random (but unique) ballot ID's.
</p><p>
The ballot ID might also be a long random string of symbols or some other unique
identifier.  For now, we assume that
coded ballot ID's are pre-printed on the ballots, but we'll see there can be
security advantages to having ballot ID's added later instead by
the voter or by the "checker" (see <a href="#sec:checker">&sect;</a>).

<h3>Filling Out The Multi-Ballot</h3>

<p>
For simplicity, we assume for now that we are using <i>approval
voting</i>, the simplest form of voting, where the voter merely indicates
for each candidate whether or not she
approves of that candidate (see
<a href="#bib">BramsFi83</a>).
<small>
For expository
convenience, the voters will be female and everybody else male.
</small>
This is like ordinary plurality voting except that voters may approve
of more than one candidate in a race.
Figure <a href="#fig:appMBabcd">&sect;</a> gives an example of a filled-out
multi-ballot.
</p><p>
We will call a filled-in bubble a <i>mark</i>  (for a
candidate).
</p><p>
The voter is given the following instructions for filling out the
multi-ballot.
</p><p>

<ul>
<li> You have three ballots; you will be casting all three.
      Proceed candidate by candidate through the multi-ballot.  Each
      candidate has three "bubbles," one on each ballot.
</li><li> To vote <b>for</b> (approve) a candidate, fill
      in any <i>two</i>, but <u>exactly two</u>, of the bubbles for that
      candidate.
</li><li> To vote <b>against</b> (disapprove) a candidate
      fill in any <i>one</i>, but <u>exactly one</u>, of the
      bubbles for that candidate.
</li><li> Your ballot <i>will not be accepted</i> if any
      candidate has no bubbles filled or has three bubbles filled.
</li><li> You may vote <b>for</b> (approve) any number of
candidates, including none of them or all of them.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking the Filled-Out Multi-Ballot</h3>
<a name="sec:checker"</a>

<p>
When a voter has marked her choices, she inserts her multi-ballot
(i.e, her three ballots) into a "checker machine," to check the
validity of her multi-ballot.  The checker might be in the voting
booth, or somewhere in the middle of the voting area.
</p><p>
The checker checks that the voter has made exactly one or two marks
for each candidate (these are "row-constraints").
</p><p>
If the multi-ballot is invalid, the checker beeps, indicates where
the errors are, and gives the ballots back.
</p>

<h3>Getting a Ballot Copy as a "Receipt"</h3>

<p>
If the multi-ballot is OK, the checker beeps (nicely),
and asks the voter to choose <i>one</i> of the three ballots
(which should be visible under glass),
e.g. by pushing button "1," "2," or "3."
The machine then makes a
<i>copy</i> of the selected one and gives it to the voter as her
take-home "receipt".  It is important that the voter chooses
<i>secretly</i> and <i>arbitrarily</i> which ballot to copy.
Which button she pushed should be known only to her and <i>not</i>
"remembered" by the machine.  The machine, indeed, should be
"dumb" and not capable of remembering anything about the ballots.
This receipt should be
printed on different paper so it looks different than her original
ballots, and it should be difficult to alter or forge.
The security of the receipt could be enhanced even further
by "certifying" it by printing on it a "digital signature"
that could have only come from an official, government voting machine.
</p><p>
The voter should check that her receipt indeed matches its corresponding ballot.
</p>

<h3>Casting Three Ballots</h3>

<p>
The machine now drops all three original ballots into the ballot box,
in view of the voter.
It ensures that the voter either cast
all three ballots, or none.
</p><p>
The ballot box has the usual property that it scrambles the ballot
order, destroying any indication of which triple of ballots originally
went together, and what order ballots were cast in.
</p><p>
The voter then signs her name on her entry on
the registration list to indicate that she voted&mdash;in such a
way that
her three ballots <i>only</i> enter the ballot box, and she
<i>only</i> gets her receipt,  if and when she signs her name off on that list.
</p><p>

<h3>Going Home</h3>

<p>
The voter takes her receipt, and goes home.
(See <a href="#sec:FloatingReceipts">&sect;</a> for a possible
extension to "Floating Receipts", where the voter will
take home a copy of some other voter's ballot instead of her own.)
</p>

 <a name="sec:postbals"</a>
<h3>Posting the Ballots</h3>

<p>
At the end of election day, all cast ballots are
scanned and published on the PBB. (Cast ballots should
<i>not</i> be scanned and posted as they are cast, but
only at the end of election day.)
</p><p>
Here scanning produces a "compact" representation of the voter's
choices that just records the marks present and the ballot IDs.  A
pixel-level scan is <i>not</i> used because a voter might mark the margin of
the ballot so she could identify her ballot image later.
</p><p>
The election officials also separately post a list of the names of all
voters who voted.
</p>

<h3>Checking the Integrity of the PBB</h3>

<p>
Once home, a voter may check that her receipt matches a ballot posted
on the PBB.  We note that ballot ID's are coded to make
them difficult to remember at the poll-site; but they can be coded
with symbol strings that are still easy to type into a web site.
(She could also give her receipt, or a copy of it, to
someone else, to check for her, if she doesn't have a convenient way
or is too busy to access the PBB herself.  <a href="#bib">Adida06</a>
discusses helper organizations.  The helper organization should
wait until election day is over and all ballots are posted before
looking at the receipts received, so that it can not gain any
possible statistical information on the voting trends during the day.)
</p><p>
If the PBB doesn't contain a matching ballot, she takes her
receipt to an election official within two days and files a protest.
The election official may examine the voter's receipt to determine its
authenticity, and may authorize a rescan of the cast paper ballots.
</p>

<h3>Tallying and Announcing the Winners</h3>

<p>
The ballots can be tallied by anyone, since they are publicly posted
in plaintext on the PBB.  No decryption is needed.
</p><p>
The winners can be announced.
</p><p>
Each voter has marked once or twice for each candidate;
the checker has enforced this.
</p><p>
So each candidate's tally will be "as usual," except that each total
is inflated by the number <i>n</i> of voters.  The election outcome is the
same.  For example, if candidates <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> would ordinarily
have received <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> votes, respectively, then with
ThreeBallot the final tallies will be <i>n+a</i>, <i>n+b</i>, and <i>n+c</i>; the
true vote totals are obtained by subtracting <i>n</i> from the total number
of marks for each candidate.

</caption>
</table>


<h3>What about range voting?</h3>

<p>
For a Range rather than Approval voting election:
same procedure
works, except for these changes.
Suppose the allowed scores are <i>{0,1,2,&hellip;,R}</i>,
where, e.g. <i>R=9</i> for single-digit range voting.
Instead of marking (or not) a bubble to indicate approval
or disapproval of that candidate the voter fills in a slot with a <i>number</i>
in <i>{0,1,2,&hellip;,R}</i>
(or by marking one of <i>R+1</i> bubbles).
The candidate constraints are that the sum <i>S</i> of
the candidate's three scores satisfy <i>R &le; S &le; 2R</i>. The checker enforces this.
To give Perot score  <i>P</i>, <i>0 &le; P &le; R</i>, she
should make sure <i>S = R+P</i>.
See Figure <a href="#fig:RVmb">&sect;</a>.
</p><p>
This completes our description of the operation of the ThreeBallot
voting system for Approval and Range voting.
</p>

<h3>Security Assumptions &amp; Mechanisms</h3>
<p>
ThreeBallot has some unique concerns among voting systems,
since the voter has as a receipt a copy of part of her vote, in
plaintext, and all ballots cast are available in plaintext on the PBB.
</p><p>
Without some additional assumptions or mechanisms, the voter
privacy of ThreeBallot can be attacked, as noted below.  We
now propose one assumption and one mechanism.
</p><p>
The <b>Short Ballot Assumption</b> (SBA) assumes that the ballot is
short&mdash;there are many more voters in an election than ways to fill
out an individual ballot&mdash;i.e., there are only a few races and only a
few candidates in each race.  That is, if the ballot has <i>C</i> candidates
total, then (for approval voting)
the number <i>2<sup>C</sup></i> of voting patterns
must be much smaller than the number of voters.
Depending on the voting system used,
the SBA may be more or less reasonable; for example
a rank-order voting system with <i>C</i> candidates has
<i>C!</i> possible voting patterns, which may easily exceed the
number of voters.
See Table <a href="#fig:sba">&sect;</a>.
It is reasonable to assume under the SBA that
each possible ballot is likely to be cast by several voters.
The security of all three of our secure voting protocols depends
on the SBA.
</p>

</caption>
</table>

<p>
An important related idea is <i>debundling</i> &ndash; separating
different races, or even different candidates in the same race
onto separate
ballots, so that the SBA holds for each ballot.
</p><p>
With Approval and Range voting, the voter provides
a <i>rating</i> for each candidate &ndash; "approve"/"disapprove,"
or a numerical score in, say, <i>[0,9]</i>.
Her rating for Xerxes is <i>independent</i> of her rating for Yu.
So in these voting systems it is <i>unnecessary</i>
and indeed <i>unnatural</i>
to force her
to rate all the candidates in a race on the
same ballot.
With Range and Approval voting,
ballots can be debundled all the way down to <i>single candidates</i> if
desired, thus guaranteeing that the SBA holds.
</p><p>
However, for Plurality,
all candidates <i>must</i> be on the same ballot, because votes
for the different candidates are <i>dependent</i> &mdash;if you
vote for Xerxes, you may not vote for Yu.
A plurality race with many candidates may have to violate SBA.
(Well, you can have a multi-page ballot with separate
coded ID on each one, as long as they are checked simultaneously.
Long candidate lists cause problems for many voting systems.)
</p><p>
There is a clear SBA/bundling trade-off.
Debundling would have been essential to achieve SBA
for approval or range voting for
the 2006 Congo presidential election,
which had <i>C=33</i> candidates.
But VAV (see <a href="#sec:vav">&sect;</a>) <i>could</i> handle Plurality for this
election with no debundling; VAV can also
handle rank-order ballot elections when
<i>C!</i> is well below the number of voters.
In many cases no debundling may be needed.
</p>

<p>
"<b>Floating Receipts</b>"
is a new security mechanism introduced in this paper
(see <a href="#sec:FloatingReceipts">&sect;</a>), wherein a voter may bring home a
receipt that is a copy of <i>some other</i> voter's ballot, and/or
extra copies of receipts could be "floating" around in unknown hands.
That can provide additional helpful layers of anonymity or security.
</p><p>
Twin depends on floating receipts, while VAV and ThreeBallot
do not, <i>but</i> one can <i>add</i> floating receipts as an
<i>extra security feature</i> to either, so that
these protocols become secure even against
a wide class of <i>collusive</i> attacks
(<a href="#sec:collusiveattacks">&sect;</a>).
For simplicity we describe ThreeBallot and VAV
without such collusion-protection, then will describe ways to add it
in <a href="#sec:FloatingReceipts">&sect;</a>.
</p>

<h3>ThreeBallot Security &mdash; Integrity</h3>

<p>
The two main voting system security requirements are
integrity of election results and voter privacy.
We begin with integrity.
</p><p>
The voter can check that
<ul>
<li> a ballot matching her receipt is posted
      on the PBB in the list of cast ballots (using
      the coded ID as the lookup key),
</li><li> the total number of ballots on the PBB
       is three times the number of voters
       who voted (the list of
       voters who actually voted is also
       published on the PBB).
</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The first check has no analogue in most current voting systems.
We'll see these
checks allow detection of several kinds of fraud.
Of course, one has to ensure that the new security mechanisms
can't themselves be easily attacked.
</p

 <a name="sec:addingbals"</a>
<h3>Adding Ballots can be Detected</h3>

<p>
An adversary can't add ballots to the PBB without putting more voter
names on the PBB, which makes the fraud detectable.
(Grandma, did you really vote? Weren't you sick that day?)
On this issue of ballot stuffing, ThreeBallot is little different
from other voting systems; the best defense is public oversight
of voter check-in process and the posting of lists of voters who
voted.
</p>

<h3>Modifying or Deleting Ballots can be Detected</h3>

<p>
An adversary can't delete or modify any posted ballots, without
risking a voter protesting that her receipt matches no ballot
on the PBB.  (The PBB has no ballot with the same ID,
or shows one with different marks.)
</p><p>
Of course, an adversary might risk modifying just a few ballots,
hoping to avoid detection since only <i>1/3</i> of the ballots are protected.
It's key that <i>nobody knows which</i> <i>1/3</i>, which assures that any
large-scale fraud would get detected
with even a low level of vigilance by voters or their proxies.
(The actual chance of detecting such fraud can be computed
with the usual sort of "auditing math" <a href="#bib">AslamPoRi07</a>.)
<blockquote><small> <a name="foot:refodds"</a>
E.g.: to detect a <i>fixed</i> level of fraud (e.g. 6%)
with significant probability (e.g. 95%), only a <i>fixed</i> number of voters
(in this case 50) need to check, no matter how large the electorate.
</small></blockquote> 
</p><p>
Since attacks by adding, modifying, or deleting ballots are
detectable, voters can have confidence in the correctness of the final
tally.
</p>

<a name="sec:no-voter-coercion"</a>
<h3>No Voter Coercion or Vote Selling</h3>

<p>
A design goal of the ThreeBallot system is that the voter should not
be able to sell her vote, since her receipt doesn't provide reliable
information on how she voted.
</p><p>
Note how ThreeBallot follows the philosophy of "vote by rows, cast by
columns"&mdash;viewing each candidate's votes as in a given row, but the ballots
are columns.  Each ballot by itself (and thus the receipt that the
voter takes home) contains no information about
whether the voter approved or disapproved any given candidate.
</p><p>
No matter whom she votes for, her receipt can have any possible
pattern of marks.
<!-- (There are <i>2<sup>r</sup></i> such patterns if the ballot has
<i>r</i> candidates: from completely empty to completely filled.) -->
Moreover, the
voter has complete control over what pattern is
shown on her receipt.
</p><p>
A coercer can pay the voter to come back with a receipt showing some
particular pattern of marks, and the voter can do so, <i>without
affecting her ability to vote in any way she chooses</i>.  She can put
the coercer's desired pattern of marks in ballot 1, and then fill in
ballots 2 and 3 to express her desired voting preference
and "outvote" ballot 1 as necessary.  She then copies
ballot 1 as her receipt to give the coercer.
</p>

<a name="sec:three-pattern"</a>
<h3>The "Three-Pattern" Attack</h3>

<p>
There is another attack with which a coercer may attempt
to buy votes or influence a voter's voting behavior.
</p><p>
In this "three-pattern" attack, the adversary pays the voter to vote
according to <i>pre-specified patterns in each of her three
ballots</i>.  That is, the adversary isn't paying for the voter's "net
vote," but paying for her to create her net vote in a <i>specific
pattern of three individual ballots</i>.  If the adversary doesn't see
<i>all three</i> pre-specified ballots posted on the PBB, the voter
doesn't get paid (or is punished).
</p><p>
The attack fails if the Short Ballot Assumption holds, since each
possible ballot pattern is likely to occur, many times.
</p>

<h3>Recounts and Audits</h3>

<p>
Because the ballots are paper, it is possible to rescan and recount
them in that form.  A recount of some precincts might be mandated by
state law, particularly for close elections.  Or, a recount might be
required if enough voters credibly claim that their receipts aren't
represented correctly or at all on the PBB.
</p>

<h3>Detecting Malicious Voters</h3>

<p>
The receipt may need some additional authentication
(cf. &sect;5.3 of <a href="#bib">Adida06</a>) to prevent voters from
maliciously claiming that their (fabricated) receipt doesn't match any
ballot on the PBB.  This authentication could be a seal
or sticker on the receipt, or (better) an unforgeable digital signature
for {the vote on the receipt, the election-name ("2008 Presidential"), and
the ballot ID}.
</p><p>
It is OK for the voter to let an
official sign her receipt as an officially approved
receipt, since voter privacy isn't threatened.  However the digital-signing
machine must <i>not remember</i> the ballot ID.
This worrisome requirement can be avoided by not revealing the ID to the signer
and not including it as part of the signed bit-string.
In that case the digital signature would protect only the vote while
the ballot ID would be protected by
old-fashioned paper-and-ink anti\-forgery technology.
</p>

<h3>Attacking the Checker</h3>

<p>
The checker needs to be tested carefully.  A maliciously modified
checker could, e.g. allow some voters, by violating the row-constraints,
to effectively have <i>three</i> votes!
</p><p>
Note that such illegal voting patterns can't be detected later, since
the row-constraint can't be re-tested once the multi-ballot is split
up.  (Of course, in some cases you may be able to tell that such an
attack has been mounted: e.g., if a candidate ends up with more than
<i>2n</i> marks.)
</p><p>
Thus, we see that there is some dependency of the correctness of
the election outcome on the correctness of the checker (assuming that
some voters would exploit an opportunity afforded by a defective
checker).
</p><p>
On the other hand, the candidate conditions are exceptionally simple to
check, and a simple hard-wired row-constraint checker may be
sufficiently trustable that one can have confidence in its correct
operation on election day.
</p><p>
One may compare this situation with other forms of VVPR
(voter-verified paper records), such as DRE-VVPAT or ordinary opscan.
ThreeBallot is like them in that the voter can directly verify her own
paper ballot, to ensure that her intent has been
captured correctly on paper.
As with other VVPR methods we must worry about
"casting multiple votes," and "ballot box stuffing."
But ThreeBallot has an additional risk: that
a corrupt checker would allow some voters to
cast a "heavier" vote than others.
But ThreeBallot
allows voters to detect modification of the collection of cast
ballots, whereas other VVPR schemes don't even attempt this.  On
balance ThreeBallot addresses better the more serious threats.
</p><p>
To compare this situation with that for cryptographic voting
schemes:  A bad checker in ThreeBallot might allow a voter to cast an
invalid multi-ballot; cryptographic schemes either make such invalid
voting impossible or require the voter to post with her vote a proof
that her (encrypted) ballot is valid.
</p><p>
John Kelsey noted that a maliciously
modified checker, since it knows which ballot is being copied as a
receipt, might be able to encode this information on the ballots
themselves (say by using a bit of steganography); a correspondingly corrupted scanner
would then know which ballots it could scan incorrectly.  This sort of
mischievous behavior also needs to be prevented, by design of the
checker, or by other controls.
</p>

<a name="sec:payingforreceipts"</a>
<a name="sec:collusiveattacks"</a>
<h3>Paying for Receipts</h3>

<p>
The adversary may be able to buy voters' receipts as they leave,
<i>and</i> then be able to manipulate the contents of the PBB.
(This is a "collusive attack," <a href="#sec:floatr">&sect;</a> since the vote-buyer and the PBB
staff must collude for it to work.)
</p><p>
Knowing that the voter has given up her ability to contest PBB
corruption, the adversary alters the PBB copy of her
corresponding ballot.
</p><p>
Voters should thus be cautioned not to casually discard or give away
(the only copy of) their
receipts.  If she uses a "helper organization" (e.g. the
ACLU) as a proxy to check PBB integrity, the voter
might give the helper organization a <i>copy</i> of her receipt,
rather than the original.
(The receipt might be signed at the poll
site with a bar-coded digital signature,
so a copy is as "authentic" as the original here.)
</p><p>
There should also be strong safeguards on PBB modification for
a "layered defense."
Current voting systems rely for their
security <i>entirely</i> on such safeguards, so ThreeBallot can't help
but be an improvement.
</p><p>
This attack works for many cryptographic schemes in the literature;
the only prior countermeasures we know of are by 
&sect;5.4 of <a href="#bib">RyanPe05</a>, who suggest both voter education
and having election officials keeping additional copies of the
receipts at the polling site, and &sect;5.2 of <a href="#bib">KarlofSaWa05</a>,
who suggest voter education.
</p>

<h3>Chain Voting</h3>

<p>
In the <i>chain voting</i> <a href="#bib">JonesChain</a> attack on paper-based
voting systems, a buyer hands a voter a pre-marked ballot.
She casts it as "her" vote, then gives the blank ballot she should
have used to the vote-buyer
(receiving payment and allowing the cycle to begin anew).
The usual remedy ensures that a voter
casts the ballot she was given.
Ballots have tear-off stubs.  When the voter first
picks up a blank ballot, a random number (e.g. from dice) is
written on the stub and recorded under that voter's name on a list;
when she casts her ballot the stub number is checked,
and the stub torn off and visibly destroyed.
Poll procedures
<!-- % (e.g. "purple fingers") -->
ensure voters cannot leave then re-enter the polls with ballots.
</p>

<h3>Voter Privacy in ThreeBallot</h3>

<p>
We now turn to the second main security requirement:
maintaining voter privacy.
</p><p>
The first of Professor Michael Shamos's "Commandments" <a href="#bib">Shamos93</a>
on voting is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Thou shalt keep each voter's choices an inviolable secret.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
A voter should not be able to violate her own privacy, even if she
wishes: she should be unable to convince anyone else that she voted in
a particular way. Otherwise she could sell her vote.  (This is why we
strongly favor pollsite voting, with its enforced voter isolation
during voting, over remote voting schemes such vote-by-mail,
vote-by-phone, or vote-by-Internet.)
</p><p>
What could the voter show an adversary
to persuade the adversary of how she voted?  Three
sorts of evidence are available:
<ul>
<li> physical evidence she brings away from the
      the voting session (such as her voting receipt),
</li><li> other evidence the voter may bring away from the
  voting session (such as ballot ID's she may have
      memorized or photographed), and
</li><li> the cast ballots on the PBB.
</li></ul>

<h3>Can Receipt violate Voter Privacy?</h3>

<p>
Can the voter violate her own privacy using her receipt?
</p><p>
Nothing prevents a voter from voting
entirely honestly on her first ballot.
If she then copies that first ballot for her
receipt, it indicates exactly how her votes will be tallied.
</p><p>
But this receipt is at best a "reminder" of how she voted, not a
proof that will convince anyone else as to how she voted.  She is
unable to intentionally violate her own privacy by showing someone
else her receipt.  (We have already argued, in
<a href="#sec:no-voter-coercion">&sect;</a>, that a voter's receipt, by
itself, bears no information about how a voter voted.  So it cannot
violate voter privacy.)
</p>

<h3>Can the Receipt be linked with its other two ballots?</h3>

<p>
No one should be able to reliably and convincingly link together the
three ballots on the PBB that constitute an original cast
multi-ballot.  Otherwise, the voter's privacy is at risk.
</p><p>
If the multi-ballot were to be printed on a single sheet of paper
(e.g., with perforations), then there would be a risk that the printer
could remember which triples of ballot ID's were valid.
(Some cryptographic voting schemes, such as Pr&ecirc;t &agrave;
Voter <a href="#bib">RyanPe05</a> also have have security vulnerabilities at the
ballot printers.)
However, with
our recommended procedure of having the voter randomly select three
ballots from a bin to constitute her multiballot, this isn't a problem.
</p>

 <a name="sec:identify"</a>
<h3>Risk Voter can identify her Multi-Ballot</h3>

<p>
The voter should not be able to record or remember the ballot ID
numbers of her three ballots.
(Voters should not be allowed to take photos of their multi-ballot!
Cell-phones, video cameras etc. must be prohibited!)
</p><p>
We have five approaches for this:
<!-- with different simplicity/security tradeoffs -->
<br>
<b>1.</b> Printing ballot ID's in a coded way, using
      punctuation and other symbols.
      Advantages: (a) simple. (b) hard for the voter to
      remember.  Unfortunately it's easy for a voter to copy manually.
<!-- It might help if the information-carrying symbols were
 scattered within some fixed "decoy" symbols, so that
 memorizing only (say) the first few symbols would be
 unlikely be helpful in identifying the ballot. -->
<b>2.</b> Barcode. Somewhat harder to copy,
   but also harder to read later when looking the ballot up on the PBB.
<br>
<b>3.</b>
ID's could be under "scratch-off."
That's more secure, but precludes cheap and
common printing equipment.
<br>
<b>4.</b>
Ballot ID's could be printed using
"visual cryptography" <a href="#bib">NaorSh94</a>;
with this approach ballot IDs by themselves are just
"random dots" which convey no information whatever.
The voter is given the plastic overlay that allows her
to read the ballot ID only <i>after</i> she receives her receipt.
Almost impossible to copy or remember
without a (incriminating)
camera or overlay.
<br>
<b>5.</b>
(The "Shamos checker".)
Michael Shamos suggested the following nifty approach, which
prevents the voter from ever seeing the ballot IDs of the
two ballots not copied:
<ul>
<li> All multi-ballots are initially identical and contain
      no ballot ID's.
</li><li> When the checker determines that a multi-ballot is OK,
      it prints three randomly generated ballot ID's
      on the three ballots, but retains the ballots for now.
</li><li> The voter selects which ballot she wants copied
      for her receipt.
</li><li> The checker spits out both the selected ballot and a
      copy of it (her receipt), and puts the other two ballots
      into a holding bin.
</li><li> She checks that the receipt and the selected ballot match.
      If so, she puts the selected ballot into the ballot box and
      presses the "Done" button on the checker, which empties the
      holding bin (containing her other two ballots) into
      the ballot box, in such a way that
      she never sees their ballot ID's.
      If not, she pushes the "I got a bad receipt" button
      on the checker (which now empties the holding bin
      with her other two ballots into a spoiled ballot bucket),
      complains to a pollworker by showing her ballot and unequal
      receipt, and votes again.
</li></ul>
The "Shamos checker" keeps the voter from ever seeing
the ballot ID's of her other two ballots, so we don't
need to worry about her memorizing or photographing
them.  It also complies with state laws (like
California's) that require all blank ballots to be
identical.  We note that if its "random" number generator
is deterministic or defective, voter privacy might be compromised.
</p>

<h3>Risk of Copying</h3>

<p>
It is better not to let the voter use a generic copying machine to
make her receipt, lest she make a copy of all three ballots.
</p><p>
The procedures we've suggested are designed to ensure that the voter only
gets a copy of one of her three ballots, and can't copy her other
ballots or their ID's.
</p>

<h3>Reconstruction Attack</h3>

<p>
In a "reconstruction" attack the adversary examines all possible
triples of ballots from the PBB, and determines which of
them form legal ThreeBallot ballots.
</p><p>
The information gained may, in some cases, be
sufficient to determine how an individual voter
voted, when taken together with either the ballot ID
available on the voter's receipt, or if that voter made an agreement beforehand
(like the three-pattern attack).
</p><p>
Under the Short Ballot Assumption, there will be many ways to piece
ballots together, and the adversary gains insufficient information to
combine triples of ballots to infer the voter's vote.
</p><p>
Strauss <a href="#bib">Strauss06B</a> provides some empirical evidence on the
effectiveness of reconstruction attacks for various sized ballots,
as do Jones et al. <a href="#bib">JonesJuBe06,BeloteJoJu06</a>.
Also see Cichon et al. <a href="#bib">CichonKuWe07</a> for some careful analysis of how
short a ballot needs to be to provide voter privacy in ThreeBallot.
</p>

<h3>Early publication "threat"</h3>

<p>
Some critics have worried that PBB posts or "leaks" could reveal
information about our vote totals (say, halfway through the election) "early";
while with full-cryptographic voting protocols, supposedly that couldn't happen.
The simplest approach is not to publish the PBB until polls
close, as in <a href="#sec:postbals">&sect;</a>.
</p><p>
But one of us (WDS) feels this really is not a security issue at all; it is a voting method issue.
After all, exit polls will defeat <i>any</i> security measures (and restricting exit poll
publication would be unconstitutional, cause more problems than it would solve,
and would not prevent "secret" exit polls whose results were
revealed only to the right people in private).
WDS feels the real problem is mainly that the Plurality voting method
(<a href="#sec:votmeth">&sect;</a>) is highly vulnerable to insincere "strategic voting,"
whereas, e.g, in Approval and Range voting
strategic decisions based on
early returns have less importance.
</p>

<h3>ThreeBallot Usability</h3>

<h3>For Voters</h3>

<p>
The ThreeBallot voting process is more complex than current
conventional voting systems, so the impact on usability must be
considered. An interesting preliminary field study <a href="#bib">JonesJuBe06</a>
indicates that ThreeBallot has significant usability issues.
</p><p>
Of course, the main method for making sure that
the voting system works well for voters is voter
education.  Although ThreeBallot is new, it is
nonetheless quite workable, and a little voter education
may make its operation clear for many or most voters.
</p><p>
However, if a voter makes a mistake, the process of
recasting a ballot is not so simple.  (Well, it's
like opscan: you need to start over with a clean
ballot.)
</p><p>
Voters who have difficulty with filling out a ThreeBallot multiballot
could be given simplified instructions (e.g. always fill in the
bubbles for a candidate from left to right).
</p><p>
Probably the best approach is to merely let voters who have undue
difficulty with ThreeBallot use conventional ("OneBallot") methods,
since you can "mix" OneBallot and ThreeBallot ballots together
(<a href="#sec:mixing3ballotwith1ballot">&sect;</a>).
</p><p>
Still, any increase in the voting complexity
will cause additional voter confusion and problems, so there
is certainly a potential price to be paid, in terms of usability,
for the security benefits of ThreeBallot.
</p>


<h3>For Election Officials &amp; Workers</h3>

<p>
ThreeBallot causes extra work for pollworkers, since the
number of paper ballots cast that need to be handled is now three
times as large as with conventional ("OneBallot") voting.
Furthermore ThreeBallot may encourage inefficient use of the ballot
page as compared to traditional opscan layouts, requiring
even more ballot pages.
</p><p>
The benefit that compensates for
this extra work and extra usability problems for voters,
is, of course, a higher degree of confidence in the integrity
of the voting process and election results.
</p>

<h3>Variations and Improvements</h3>

<p>
We have presented and discussed the main architectural components of a
ThreeBallot voting scheme: vote-by-candidates (rows) but
cast-by-columns, take a column copy home as a receipt, and post all
ballots on a PBB.  We now review further variations and
extensions.
</p>

<a name="sec:mixing3ballotwith1ballot"</a>
<h3>Mixing One- with ThreeBallot</h3>

<p>
A conventional opscan voting system might be called OneBallot&mdash;each
voter votes just once and can't take away a copy of her vote cast,
whereas with ThreeBallot the voter casts three ballots, and takes away
a copy of (an arbitrarily and secretly chosen) one.
</p><p>
You can actually mix these two systems.  A OneBallot voter can toss
her ballot in the same ballot box that a ThreeBallot voter places her
three in.  The PBB should indicate for each <i>voter</i> whether she
is a OneBallot voter or a ThreeBallot voter, so that anyone may check
that the PBB contains the correct number of ballots, but it should not be possible to tell
by examination of a <i>ballot</i> which type it was.
</p><p>
This provides a transitional path from OneBallot to ThreeBallot
voting, as voters can choose which system to use.
Our systems are compatible so counting is the same.
</p><p>
A nice feature of mixing the two systems is that the OneBallots
are <i>protected</i> by being in the same ballot box as
ThreeBallots, since an adversary will hesitate to corrupt
any ballots as they might be ThreeBallots which
voters have retained copies of.  (OneBallots must be valid in
the usual sense, e.g, for plurality voting, without overvotes or undervotes.
But a ThreeBallot might also be valid that way, so an adversary would be
prevented from deleting or modifying just OneBallot ballots.
Anyhow, with approval voting all ballots are valid.)
</p>

<h3>Write-In Votes</h3>

<p>
ThreeBallot Range and Approval voting trivially permit "write-in"
votes <i>if</i> voter-ratings of write-in candidates are handled
debundled on <i>separate</i> ballots.  (If they were bundled on the
same ballot as the regular candidates, voters could attempt to
identify their ballots by writing-in unique "candidate" names.
Cf. <a href="#bib">KiayiasYu04</a>.)  Range voting with high-precision scores also
has to be forbidden for the same reason
(insist on single-digit range voting).
<!--  RLR &ndash; I think this footnote is just too confusing for this version of our paper. -->
<blockquote><small>Albeit in principle it could be
handled by a further level of debundling &ndash; down below single
candidates into single <i>digits</i> of large numbers.</small></blockquote>
</p><p>
Our schemes for plurality and rank-order voting systems unfortunately
cannot handle write-in candidates.
</p>

<a name="sec:vote-counting"</a>
<h3>Other Vote-Counting Methods</h3>

<p>
As we have seen, ThreeBallot works fine for "approval" voting.
</p><p>
Although we prefer to handle plurality voting with VAV
(<a href="#sec:vav">&sect;</a>), ThreeBallot can do it too;
we add "race constraints"
to the "row-constraints" already discussed;
each race constraint permits the voter to approve at most
one candidate per race.  This makes the checker more
complicated (it now must know which candidates are
in the same race), but otherwise not much changes.
(We note that an individual ballot might be part of a legal
threeballot, yet now look like an illegal overvote; that is OK.)
</p><p>
ThreeBallot does not work at all for ranked preference voting systems
such as Borda, IRV, %(instant runoff voting),
or Condorcet.
Our VAV protocol (<a href="#sec:vav">&sect;</a>) does.
</p>

<h3>ThreeBallot &ndash; Summary</h3>

<p>
Cryptographic techniques can also provide all of
the security properties of ThreeBallot, and more.
See
Chaum <a href="#bib">Chaum04</a>,
Chaum et al. <a href="#bib">ChaumRySc04</a>,
Ryan et al. <a href="#bib">RyanSc06,RyanPe05</a>,
Karloff et al. <a href="#bib">KarlofSaWa05</a>,
Smith <a href="#bib">Smith05, SmithV1, SmithV2</a>,
and Adida <a href="#bib">Adida06</a>
for presentations and discussions of cryptographic
voting methods.
</p><p>
However, ThreeBallot achieves almost as good
security properties, without cryptography.
</p><p>
We note for the record that we have nothing against cryptographic
voting methods&mdash;they are very appealing, although a bit complex.
</p><p>
That's why this paper's goal is to see to what extent the security properties
of cryptographic schemes can be
achieved in a "low-tech" manner, without cryptography.
</p><p>
What happens after our protocols prove there was fraud?
Election systems need
a more graceful way to recover from errors than merely declaring failure;
we somehow need to insert <i>accountability</i> and <i>corrective feedback.</i>
Our protocols, while imperfect in that respect, seem as good, and
in some ways superior, to present-day paper balloting.
The potential for "superiority"
is since in our schemes with <i>preprinted ballot IDs</i>, we can set up a
chain of custody
for all ballots within ballot-number intervals.
E.g, there will be records saying "Joe Schnoz obtained custody of ballots
#785400-823100 at 6pm on 30 September."
Now suppose some cast ballots vanished or were altered,
or fake voters voted (on stolen blank ballots).
Then we <i>know</i> exactly who was supposed to have custody of the ballots
with those numbers and when, so we can try to assign blame and stop the corruption.
</p><p>
Recovery from some errors (e.g. too many ballots on the PBB) can be
problematic.
Rescanning the cast paper ballots may suffice to fix many problems.
ThreeBallot is really just a paper ballot scheme, with the usual
issues and remedies, except that voters cast three ballots constructed
in a novel manner, and have a new protocol for checking that at least
one of their ballots is counted in the final ballot box.
</p><p>
ThreeBallot also has pedagogic value as a "stepping stone"
when explaining cryptographic voting protocols, as it strives to
achieve similar properties with simpler methods.
</p><p>
Note that the voter is getting not only verification that her vote is
"cast as intended" (as with most VVPAT or paper-trail systems), but
also getting evidence that her vote is actually affecting the final
tally as it should.
</p><p>
So, the ThreeBallot voting system seems to give a nice level of
end-to-end verifiability with "plausible" (but not great) user
interface, without cryptography.

<h3>3. VAV</h3> 

<p>
VAV stands for "Vote / Anti-Vote / Vote".
</p><p>
The VAV scheme is similar to ThreeBallot: each voter casts three
ballots.
</p><p>
In VAV each ballot is pre-marked as either a "Vote" (positive, marked
"V"), or an "Anti-Vote" (negative, marked "A").
The voter casts one two Votes and one Anti-Vote, and we demand that
one of the Votes exactly cancels the Anti-Vote (it is identical except for
the A/V indicators).  See Figure <a href="#fig:PlvavMB">&sect;</a>.

The only concern is that each Vote shouldn't contain too much
information &ndash; that would allow the voter to cast a  ballot highly likely to be unique,
thus allowing her to sell her vote to a buyer who can verify its
presence on the PBB.
Thus, we are again
assuming a version of the Short Ballot Assumption (SBA).
The reason that VAV is superior to ThreeBallot for <i>plurality</i> voting,
is that with VAV in a <i>C</i>-candidate race, the number of possible ballot-patterns is <i>C</i>
&ndash; small, easily permitting satisfaction of the SBA &ndash;
whereas with ThreeBallot it would have been <i>2<sup>C</sup></i>
&ndash; large, often forcing violation
of the SBA.

(the OneBallots are all "V").
</p>

<a name="sec:FloatingReceipts"</a>
<h3>4. Floating Receipts</h3>  

<p>
"Floating Receipts" is a simple and powerful security-enhancing idea.
How can it help?
ThreeBallot and VAV, as we have described them, can unfortunately be
vulnerable to <i>collusive attacks</i>
(e.g. modifying the PBB after obtaining some receipts)
as described in <a href="#sec:collusiveattacks">&sect;</a>.
</p><p>
The method proposed here ("floating receipts") addresses
these concerns by having voters
<i>take home copies of receipts other than their own.</i>
Essentially, there is a big bin of receipts, and voters first make
a copy (to take home) of one receipt already in the bin (leaving
the original in the bin), then %randomly
toss their own original receipt into the bin.  This method has the following
properties:
<p align="left"> <b>Anonymity:</b> No one knows which voter
cast the ballot corresponding to a given receipt copy with any
useful probability.
</p>
<p align="left"> <b>Exchange:</b> No voter takes home a copy of
her own receipt.
</p>
<p align="left"> <b>Coverage:</b> A constant fraction of the original
receipts are copied, with high probability (and there is no way for anybody to know what that subset is).
</p>
<p align="left"> <b>Collusion-Resistance:</b> An adversary has no
efficient method for confidently obtaining <i>all</i>  the copies of
a given receipt.
</p>
<p>
The Exchange property fights any attacks wherein an adversary
pays for receipts of a given form.  Collusion-Resistance fights
attacks where the adversary collects <i>all</i> copies of
a given receipt, so as to evade PBB manipulation detection.
Coverage ensures that any significant PBB manipulation has
a good probability of being detected.   And Anonymity is useful
for use in voting schemes (like "Twin" below) that would otherwise
not have anonymity.
</p><p>
Voters traditionally have been anonymous "going into" the voting
process (submitting ballots).
Floating receipts now provide a new layer of anonymization
"coming out" (taking home receipt copies).
</p><p>
Note that to check the integrity of the PBB,
the voter only needs to bring home a copy of <i>some</i> cast
ballot.  We admit she would have more motivation
to check her <i>own</i>
<!-- % <blockquote><small>
% We also have ways (omitted in this short paper) to modify VAV to <i>both}
% incorporate floating-receipt collusion protection
% <i>and} allow voters to verify their own votes.}
-->
ballot, but assume that many voters will check anyway.
<!--
%%% RLR 6/14: what are we talking about above?

% RLR: The following example adds nothing over what was already in
% RLR: the section on "paying for receipts", and in addition might
% RLR: offend some people unnecessarily.
% For example, consider this disturbing "Bible meeting attack."
% Christian voters at their Bible meeting are urged to hand in their
% receipts to their pastor (who represents an election-protection watchdog group)
% for "safe keeping."
% But, unknown to both the voters and pastor, this "watchdog" group is
% really part of a conspiracy to elect Evil.
% The conspirators
% <ol>
% <li>
% record the ballot IDs in their collection,
% </li><li>
% get corrupt talliers to alter all the corresponding ballots which vote "against" Evil
% so they now vote "for" Evil,
% </li><li>
% burn their anti-Evil receipts so that this fraud is now unproveable. (They can, however,
% still act like a legitimate watchdog organization to detect frauds <i>against}
% Evil.)
% </li></ol>

<a name="sec:floatr"</a>
<h3>Making "floating receipts"</h3>   

<p>
There are many ways of implementing floating receipts; we
now elaborate the approach sketched above.
<blockquote><small>The
method here, though developed independently, can be
also usefully be viewed as an extension of the earlier "Farnel" protocol
(see A.J. Devegili <a href="#bib">Devegili01,AraujoCuWiTa06</a>) to handle
ballot receipts rather than ballots themselves; in the Farnel protocol
no take-home receipts were envisioned.</small></blockquote>
</p><p>
Let <i>T</i> be a constant (e.g. <i>T=20</i>), significantly
less than the number of voters,
such that <i>1/T</i> is a "small" probability.
There is an initially empty "bin" (receipt reservoir).  %no longer fixed size 2T.
</p><p>
Each voter begins our "floating receipt" protocol having cast her
ballots, and having the receipt.  So far everything is as in ThreeBallot or VAV
but we now consider adding an additional Floating Receipts layer of defense.

<p align="left"> <b>[Phase I]</b>
The first <i>T</i> voters put their original receipts in the bin, and receive
nothing to take home.
</p>
<!--% (But see Phase III.)-->

<p align="left"> <b>[Phase II]</b>
After that every voter:
(a) gets a <i>copy</i> 
to take home of a receipt chosen randomly from the bin
(the original is returned to the bin),
and then
(b) deposits her own original receipt into the bin.
The take-home receipt copies are certified as authentic as the
voter leaves, with a notary-like stamp or
a digital signature (as long as the signing device doesn't record what
it sees).  When the voter leaves she might also be required to sign the
registration book to certify that she has voted.
</p><p>
After the polls close, the final contents of the bin may be
discarded or published in some manner
<blockquote><small>We could also add an optional <b>Phase III</b>
in which the first <i>T</i> voters <i>return</i>  
to the polls at the end of the day and collect "delayed"
receipts as in <b>IIa</b> &ndash; or we might only demand phase III for voting machines
on which <i>&lt; 2T</i> voters voted (i.e. precisely those seen ex post facto to have
violated our assumption that <i>T</i>
was small compared to the number of voters).</small></blockquote>
according to the preferences of the election officials,
or perhaps given to an election-monitoring organization&mdash;these receipts could also be checked against
the PBB.
</p><p>
The voter may use her receipt copy to check
the PBB integrity and, if necessary, file a protest.
</p><p>
Clearly, no voter gets a copy of her own receipt to take home; she
only gets copies of receipts from randomly chosen
previous voters. That is, our "floating receipt" protocol
satisfies both the <i>Anonymity</i>  and  <i>Exchange</i>  properties.
The protocol also satisfies the <i>Coverage</i>  property, since, e.g,
each of the first half of the deposited receipts has probability at least
<i>1- &prod<sub>n+1&le;n&le;2n</sub>(1-1/m) = 1/2</i> 
of being selected at least once for copying.
And it satisfies <i>Collusion-Resistance</i>  since it is not clear from a receipt copy
when the corresponding original receipt was deposited, and any voter since
the original deposit might also have a copy of that receipt.
</p><p>
We note that even if <i>all</i> voters conspire to sell their votes, there is
no way to prove how any one of them voted, even if they all
reveal the receipt copies they brought home.
</p><p>
Floating receipts are quite powerful; in the next section we examine
a voting system based almost entirely on the use of floating receipts.
</p>

<a name="sec:twin"</a>
<h3>5. "Twin"&mdash;a simple OneBallot voting protocol</h3>   

<p>
Twin is a remarkably simple voting system
based almost entirely on the power of floating receipts.
It works for <i>any</i>  voting system
given the SBA.
Basically, it simply employs the floating receipts scheme last section
combined with <i>One</i>Ballot voting:
</p><p>
Each voter simply marks a ballot
and puts it in a bin, receiving a copy of a random previously-cast ballot
from that bin as her take-home receipt.
(Ballots have ID numbers hidden under scratch-off. 
A checking machine can check that the marking is valid and the scratch-off remains
unscratched, and only if so is the ballot placed in the bin; the
scratch-off is automatically removed as it enters.
The bin can be transparent enough so that everybody can see this all is happening, although
not transparent enough to permit voters to read their ballot's ID number.
Only voters later than the <i>T</i>th receive take-home receipts,
although an optional "phase III" can be added as
in <a href="#sec:floatr">&sect;</a>.)
<blockquote><small>Juho Laatu and D.D.K.Sleator also emailed us some
related proposals.</small></blockquote>
The receipts can have notary-stamps or digital signatures added when they are
given to the voter.
<blockquote><small>
Watchdog groups, or anybody with a
computer, could provide publicly-usable digital-signature verifiers everywhere.</small></blockquote>
At the end of the day,
all the ballots in the bin,
and a list of all voter names and
addresses, are posted on the PBB.
</p><p>
Twin is simple; the voter need not do any arithmetic, nor worry about strange consistency
conditions for multiple ballots.
You can't sell your vote because your receipt is a copy of somebody else's ballot.
Talliers can't manipulate the PBB without risking detection,
since there is a certified copy of
most ballots
somewhere and they don't know which ones and who has the copies.
Talliers can't add or delete ballots (cf. <a href="#sec:addingbals">&sect;</a>).
"Dumpster-diving" or other methods to collect discarded receipts, followed
by cheating to alter the corresponding PBB ballots, are <i>unsafe</i>  for
cheaters because the collusion-resistance property of floating receipts.
<!-- Twin and OneBallot voting can again be mixed as in 
<a href="#sec:bmixing3ballotwith1ballot">&sect;</a>. -->
</p><p>
One worry with Twin
is that since voters cannot verify their <i>own</i> ballots,
a small political party may feel that only a tiny fraction of its
ballots are verified by loyal party members.  But a major party may well
be motivated to prevent fraud against a minor party in cases where it alters an election,
and voter education should stress
that voters should check whatever receipt they
were given, as part of their civic duty.
</p>

<h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Our new voting system, ThreeBallot, allows
voters to verify that their votes are cast as intended, and
to check that their vote is included in the final
tally.  All cast ballots are published, tampering
with votes can be detected, and vote-privacy seems unbreachable,
given SBA.
</p><p>
This is the first time such end-to-end verifiability has been obtained
<i>without</i>  the use of cryptographic techniques.
Indeed the use of powerful
computerized DRE machines with our protocols is actually <i>bad</i> 
because those computers might be, e.g, remembering things, such as ballot-triples,
which would destroy our security.   We require <i>simple</i>  and <i>manifestly
un-powerful</i>  machines.
<blockquote><small> <a name="foot:computerscanbeok"</a>
However, <i>after</i>  the ballots have been cast and checked
and the voters have gotten their receipts,
from <i>then onward</i>  everything could be computerized, and it would not matter if
those computers perhaps were penetrated, in the sense that anything they did wrong or fraudulently
would be detectable.
</small></blockquote>
The principles employed
by ThreeBallot are simple and easy to understand.
</p><p>
VAV increases ThreeBallot's applicability
to handle <i>all</i> voting systems, and in some cases
enlarges the set of elections for which the Short Ballot
Assumption reasonably holds.
</p><p>
The notion of Floating Receipts is new here, and greatly
strengthens the security properties of ThreeBallot and VAV.
</p><p>
Twin is a remarkably simple voting system, based almost
entirely on Floating Receipts.  It has practical
potential.
<blockquote><small>(ThreeBallot,
VAV, and Twin are hereby placed in the public domain&mdash;We are not
filing for any patents on this approach, and we encourage others who
work on extensions, improvements, or variations of this approach to
act similarly.  Our democracy is too important&hellip; )</small></blockquote>
</p><p>
All three systems can be "mixed" with ordinary OneBallot voting
as in <a href="#sec:mixing3ballotwith1ballot">&sect;</a>; this exerts a protective effect on
the ordinary ballots and provides an "easy upgrade path."
