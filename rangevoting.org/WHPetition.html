<H1> Petitions to White House (1 Oct. 2011) </H1>

<p>
We created some new petitions on "We the People" at WhiteHouse.gov
you can sign online.   Will you?
If these petitions get 5,000 signatures by 31 October 2011
(which means you need to recruit more signers!!! Don't just sign, recruit!),
then the White House will review it and respond so we can have a
fine "screw you" letter to hang on our walls.
  You can view and sign the petitions here:

<b>Later Note.</b>
The White House, after a very small number of petitions exceeded their 5000-signature threshold,
discovered they were not terribly to their liking.  (E.g. "legalize marijuana.")  They therefore raised
the threshhold to 25000 signatures got in 30 days &ndash; a 500% increase.
This constitutes a barrier essentially impossible
for a true grassroots petition to surmount (especially one that starts out invisible under the white house
enforced-invisibility policy).  Only huge moneyed organizations can hope to do that.  The white house has with
this change made it crystal clear they do not give one particle of excrement about the grassroots and care solely
about big money.  Also, the white house sent me a letter <i>canceling</i> my "abolish gerrymandering" petition
on the grounds that it "invaded the personal privacy" of some (unnamed!) individual.  I enquired
what the <i>hell</i> that could possibly have meant, but the white house did not respond.

<p>
So, I am sorry to report that this game appears to be rigged, and I regret having wasted my time on it.
