 Which voting systems yield Condorcet Winners under reasonable assumptions 
about voter strategic behavior?
 </H2>

<p>
We had 
<a href="AppCW.html">argued</a> under "reasonable assumptions" about 
strategic voter behavior, that
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> with strategic voters
would always elect 
<a href="Glossary.html#condwin">Condorcet winners</a>
(based on honest voters)
whenever a Condorcet winner (CW) exists.
(<small>
The "reasonability" of these assumptions can be questioned, but it at least
[1] should be clear exactly
what they are and [2] should be clear that they enjoy at least 
some approximate validity in practice.
</small>)
</p><p>
Counter-intuitively,  with strategic voters
<a href="Glossary.html#condmeths">Condorcet</a>
voting systems (which are <i>designed</I> to elect Condorcet winners)
actually can (and in some simulation studies 
<a href="StratHonMix.html">do</a>)
exhibit <i>smaller</i> probability of electing CWs than range voting.
</p>
<p>
The 
<a href="AppCW.html">argument</a>
for why Range elects CWs seems very simple and quite general.  
Therefore you might expect/hope that,
via slight variants of that argument, we could show that strategic voters under
many <i>other</i> voting
systems <i>also</i> elect CWs. 
We now examine that and find that the argument clearly works <i>better</i> when applied to
range voting, than when applied to Plurality, Approval, and Instant Runoff (IRV).
</p>
<p>

<h3>
<i>Which</i> voting systems elect CWs?
</h3>

<p>
We go through systems one at a time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Plurality voting.</b>
You might (as a first try) argue that plurality voters will elect Condorcet
winners because
<ol>
<li>
If they were to elect somebody else P,
then they would not because
</li><li>
They'd view both the Condorcet winner C and P as
top-2 competitors (?) in which case
</li><li>
They'd strategically vote for one of those top-two
</li><li>
causing C to win, not P.
</li></ol>
<p>
However, the way voters <i>learn</i> who <i>are</i> the top-2 that they
must strategically vote for (else they "waste their vote")
is via e.g, pre-election polls. 
Such polls, assuming they too are conducted using
plurality voting, will <a href="LoseAll.html">not necessarily</a>
indicate that a Condorcet winner
is in the top two. 
(E.g. one who is everybody's second choice would
get zero plurality votes, completely escaping notice. There are many
other less-dramatic scenarios.  This is very common when, for example, a third-party candidate
is preferred by the voters from each of the two major parties over the major-opponent,
and the two majors have approximately equal support.  
In that case the third-party candidate is the
Condorcet "beats all" winner but gets a very tiny percentage of the plurality top-rank votes.
To see <i>how</i> common this is, see the <a href="#app">appendix</a>.)
</p><p>
Hence plurality voting will <i>not</i> necessarily
elect CWs under reasonable assumptions about strategic voter behavior.
</p>

<p>
<b>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV):</b>
You might at first argue, IRV voters will elect Condorcet winners
because
<ol>
<li>
If they were to elect somebody else "I",
then they would not because
</li><li>
They'd view both the Condorcet winner C and I as
top-2 competitors (?) in which case
</li><li>
They'd strategically vote for one of those top-two
</li><li>
causing C to win, not I.
</li></ol>
<p>

<p>
However, the pre-election polls (presumably now conducted using IRV)
would again <a href="CoreSupp.html">not necessarily</a>
indicate a CW (e.g. in the same third-party CW scenario we just explained). 
Again a CW who was everybody's 2nd
choice would get eliminated instantly by IRV and would score
pessimally in any poll. 
So such a CW would never be spotted
as a strong contender by IRV pre-election polls. 
Indeed,
any CW (or anybody) placing 3rd-or-worse as in <a href="Peru06Exec.html">Peru 2006</a>,
would then not be elected by
(this kind of) strategic IRV voters.
(To see <i>how</i> common it is for a Condorcet winner not to be one of the
two top finishers in IRV, see the <a href="#app">appendix</a>.  
This seems to have happened 9 times in the 150 federal IRV elections in
<a href="Aus07.html">Australia 2007</a>.)
</p><P>
So again &ndash; IRV voting will not necessarily
elect CWs under reasonable assumptions about strategic voter behavior.
</p>

<p>
<b>Range voting:</b>
In order for the <a href="AppCW.html">argument</a> to
work to cause strategic range voters to elect an honest-voter
Condorcet winner C, it suffices if the range voters get the idea
that C is a strong contender.
If they believe C is one of
the top-2 most likely to win, then (the argument roughly proceeds)
<ol>
<li>
If somebody else R is
the winner of the pre-election range-voting polls, then
after strategic range voting, C will win.
</li><Li>
else (C won the pre-election polls and R was
the 2nd-placer) then C will still win.
</li></ol>

<p>
So if range voters get the idea that the Condorcet Winner
C is one of the top 2 contenders, then when they vote strategically,
C will win.
</p>
<p>
In short, <i>if</i> range were going to elect C as the winner
or second-place finisher, <i>then</i> range would elect C
with strategic voters.  <i>Strategic voting <b>amplifies</b> the chances range elects
a Condorcet winner to be <b>at least</b> as large as the chances it elects
the CW as top or second.</i>
</p>
<p>
In practice, I suggest to you, those chances are pretty big.
See the 
<a href="#app">appendix</a>
to see <i>how</i> big &ndash; clearly there is a greater chance 
the Condorcet winner is among the top-two range finishers, 
than for any other voting method tried (namely IRV, plurality,
approval) in that appendix, <i>and</i> as we'll explain next paragraph,
those numbers are <i>only a lower bound</i>
on the chance strategic range  voters will elect an honest-CW (<i>unlike</i>
for IRV and plurality
where they are also an upper bound).
</p>
<p>
If, however, the range voters in honest-voting pre-election polls
make C be the 3rd-place finisher, then what?
Well (unlike IRV &amp; plurality),
strategic range voters then <i>still</i> might elect C.
(It's pretty likely, but no longer a sure thing.)
So we can see immediately that the argument works
<i>better</i> for range than for Plurality or IRV.
<!--
For example, say A and B are the top 2 finishers in pre-election
polls with say,
55: A=9 C=3 B=0
35: B=9 C=3 A=0
10: C=9 B=7 A=0
then C is the Condorcet winner. But the top-2 range finishers
are A with 495 and B with 385, with C bringing up the
rear with 340. In view of these poll results, the
range voters here would then re-vote strategically
55: A=9 C=? B=0
35: B=9 C=? A=0
10: C=B=9 A=0
where ? presumably is 3 or less.
So C still ends up (even further in) 3rd place.

In this contrasting range pre-election poll
23: A=9 C=1 B=0
30: A=9 C=6 B=0
45: B=9 C=6 A=0
2: C=9 B=8 A=0
C is the condorcet winner but 3rd-place range finisher.
The range voters in view of this would strategically vote
23: A=9 C=B=0
30: A=C=9 B=0
45: B=C=9 A=0
2: C=B=9 A=0
and C wins.
-->

<p>
Finally, what about <b>Condorcet methods?</b>
Will they elect CWs?
</p><p>
Well... presumably C (the CW) wins the pre-election (assumed conducted
with Condorcet) poll!
</p><p>
Now what happens in the subsequent
real election? 
Now the anti-C voters strategically rank C bottom.
As a result, it is possible that now no Condorcet winner
exists, and hence C no longer wins. See
<a href="CondStratProb.html">this</a>
and
<a href="CondBurial.html">this</a>
for exactly how that can happen plus some
discussion of how often that happens in different Condorcet flavors.
</p><P>
Thus, in this sort of scenario, strategic Condorcet voters will,
quite plausibly, fail to elect an (honest-voter) Condorcet winner, even assuming
there are honest voters in the pre-election poll so that  one is "elected" by that poll.
(The difference is because the "strategy" <i>worked</i>.)
</p><P>
Observe that this will not happen with range.
With range, if C wins the pre-election poll, C will still win
the real election with strategic voters this time. Guaranteed.
With Condorcet: not guaranteed.
</p><p>
That is an example of the strange fact that range voting can be more
likely to elect Condorcet winners, than "official" Condorcet methods.
Counterintutive, but it can be true (<a href="StratHonMix.html">simulation experiments</a>
have clearly verified this).

<h3> Appendix: Numbers (to back this all up) </h3>

<p><small> All numbers here are from
<a href="IEVS/IEVS.c">IEVS 3.24</a> Monte Carlo runs. (29999 elections per datapoint.
Each election using 31 honest voters.  I have also done runs with
63 and 127 voters but the results change little, hence are not tabulated here.)

The reader may not love the
<a href="Glossary.html#REM">random elections model</a>.
Those readers should check the
2D <a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">positional politics</a>
models:  Range also usually elects Condorcet winners there. 
Each picture there contains
40,000 pixels, each one representing a different election result.  If you check the
pictures based on the set of 14 random candidates, you will observe that the range and 
Condorcet pictures very nearly coincide.  However, in contrast, the Condorcet picture
disagrees with the IRV picture in about 25% of the pixels (i.e. 
in about 25% of 2D-positional-model elections).
