<H2> What does the Bible say about range voting? </H2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.bible.com/">Bible</a>
never mentions the word "vote" or "voting."
(For other online bibles see 
<a href="http://unbound.biola.edu/">1</a>,
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">2</a>,
<a href="http://www.ibs.org/">3</a>...)

So is democracy 
pretty much a post-Biblical concept &ndash;  an invention of humans trying
to rule themselves, one might say, rather
than directly an invention of God?
Well, here is one quote from the Bible which seems to say that God
recommends representative democracy!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<b>Deuteronomy 1:6-13</b>:
The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying...
Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint 
them as your heads.
</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For a different biblical example of something that sounds like an election, see
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<b>Acts 6:3-5.</b>
</font>
</p>

<p>
But the fact that God did not say exactly <i>how</i> to "choose," and never mentions the word
"vote,"  can make it a little hard to get direct guidance from the
Bible.  However, despite the Bible not directly ever mentioning voting,
the whole idea of humans trying to rule themselves in a just manner is of
course a big theme of the Bible.  I think obviously God wants us to choose in the fairest
and best manner we can.
</P>

<p>
While I am hardly a Biblical scholar,
let me tell you a few interesting things.  
(I am sure many of you can add more
insights better than I ever could.  Please do.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<b> Genesis 1:4-20</b>:
And God saw [that] the light was good...
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters 
called the Seas: and God saw that it was good...
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree
yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good...
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the 
darkness: and God saw that it was good...
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought 
forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw 
that it was good...
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and 
every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 
</font>

<p>
The above passage resembles "<a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval Voting</a>."
Approval voting is a predecessor of Range Voting.  In approval voting
you vote 1 ("approve") or 0 ("disapprove") for <i>every</i> candidate.
You do not just vote just for a <i>single</i> candidate, and then shut up,
saying nothing about the others (which is
the much worse current USA system, called "plurality voting").

Here God is saying he <i>approves</I> of the light, land, seas, trees, fruit, whales, animals,
etc.  He is <i>not</i> saying "Hey, I approve of <i>just one</i> of these things
and the rest can go jump off a cliff."   And He is mentioning the light
and the earth <i>more than once</i> which is something like 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>,
in which you can express <i>different levels</i> of approval, not just a bare "yes" or "no."
(If He only wanted to say a bare yes or no, why didn't He just use each word once?
Presumably there was a reason, and the most obvious guess at that reason was He wanted to
express <i>more intensity</i> for the repeated things.)
As someone might put it today,
God here seems to want to say he is a particular fan of solar power and the environment!

<blockquote>
<p>  
<a name="Samuel"></a> 
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<b>2 Samuel 14:17</b>:
Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an 
angel of God, so is my lord the king to <i>discern good from bad</I>: therefore the LORD thy God 
will be with thee. (My italics.)
</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

Again in this passage, we have the Bible telling humans trying to rule themselves
(in this case the king) to "discern good from bad."  In plurality voting, you can't
discern good from bad very effectively!  &#9832; For example, if you
vote for Bush, then your vote says <i>absolutely nothing</i> about whether you
consider Nader, or Gore, or Peroutka, to be good or bad, and how much.  Range voting
seems <i>exactly what the Bible requested</i>:
a highly effective way to  discern good from bad.  Each voter gives
each candidate a score anywhere from 0 (bad) to 99 (good).  And voters who feel ignorant 
about a candidate (or do not want to express an opinion about him)
are free to leave that candidate's 
entry <a href="Blanks.html">blank</a>, thus not
polluting the discernment about him with either a mere guess or a downward-bias to 0.

<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<b>Genesis 2:15,</b>
</font>
one of the earliest verses in the Bible,
calls on mankind
"<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">to watch over and care for</font>" and/or 
"<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">to guard</font>"
(depending on the translation/version)
the bounty of the earth and its creatures.
(Again, God the environmentalist?) 
But how is mankind to accomplish its sacred caretaker duty 
without a <i>good way to make decisions</i>?  Think about it.  Mankind collectively
knows what is going on with the Earth.  Although any particular human
(such as you) is not intimately familiar with almost all of
the Earth, almost every part of the Earth <i>is</i> familiar to <i>some</i> person.
<i>Collectively</i>, then, we have what it takes to make good decisions.
But without a good <i>way</i> to translate that collective knowledge into
a decision, we are stymied.  <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> voting, with its 
<a href="LoseAll.html">ridiculous pathologies</a> which can easily cause us to
make the <i>worst</I> decision, is not it. 
Range voting is the missing piece of the puzzle.

<blockquote>
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman">
<p>
<b>Job 34:1-4</b>:
Then Elihu continued and said...
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; 
Let us know among ourselves what is good.
</P>

<p>
<b>2 Corinthians 5:10</b>:
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be <i>good</I> or <i>bad</i>.

</blockquote>


<H3> One more thing </H3>

<p>
It was recently realized that <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a>
have been conducting "elections" to make hive-relocation decisions since long before the
first human ever thought of the concept of "voting" &ndash; and the method they use is
(essentially) range voting!   Honeybees are amazingly clever insects.
If this is not a Sign from God that range voting is an excellent voting
method, I don't know what is.
