<H2> About the Center for Range Voting </H2>

<p>
The CRV was founded in 2005 by me, 
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">Warren D. Smith</a>
jointly with Jan Kok. 
I'm a PhD mathematician who has
studied voting methods for some years.  Its goals are to
<ol>
<li> educate the public about the advantages of range voting and comparative disadvantages of other systems (especially the USA's embarrassingly poor current "plurality" system), and 
</li>
<li>
lobby for its adoption.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The present website can be viewed as a huge collaboratively-written slowly-evolving
<b>book</b> (as of 2103 it contains over 1000 web pages) about voting methods. 
As of 2103 Warren D. Smith is the main author/editor of this "book," but there are many others, 
(who are credited on the pages they wrote).
</p>

<p>
I do not feel I am terribly suited to the job of being a political activist and organizer.
But I do know what I am doing about voting systems, and appreciate
the tremendous benefit that they can bring humanity.
</p>

<p>
In fact I was the first to <i>measure</i>
that benefit for the range voting
system (in 2000, see paper #56 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>) 
via massive computer election
simulations with the aid of a statistical yardstick called
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.  This measurement showed that
range voting is superior to <i>every</i> other commonly proposed single-winner voting
system.   That was quite amazing.  I had not expected any nearly as dramatic superiority
of anything.  And the superiority was very "robust," by which I mean, you could
change all sorts of parameters inside the simulation,
governing: voter behavior, number of candidates, number of voters,
how the voters perceive the candidates, what is at stake,
etc. &ndash; and no matter what you did, range 
voting remained on top of the heap.
And the <i><a href="Uniqbest.html">amount</a></i> by which range was better, stunned me some more.
Bayesian Regret is a quantitative measure roughly translatable to
"dollars lost" or "lives wasted" as  result of bad election results throughout history.
The annual amount of such damage that would be eliminated by switching from our present
plurality system to range voting, is comparable to or
exceeds the annual improvement we got from adopting democracy in the first place.
That is how major an improvement we are talking about here.  And what it
takes is incredibly small.   This is probably the hugest improvement possible for
humanity compared to the effort in principle needed to do it.
</p>

<p>
I tried to convince others of this.  Little success.  And all the time I
was learning more about voting systems and what it would take to make them happen.
Three important discoveries and realizations were 
<ol>
<li>
When we conducted the first-ever study of range (and <a href="rangeVapp.html">approval</a>)
voting with real random voters in a real election &ndash; the US 2004 presidential election &ndash;
we found out that range voting gave <a href="PsEl04.html">tremendously improved</a>
vote counts to <i>all</i> third party candidates.  That meant that it was realistic for us
to hope for <i>unified</i> third party support.  After all &ndash; it is their
<a href="TPHist.html">political "lives" at stake</a> and this system is by far the best for
them.  (Unlike, say <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> which is 
<a href="NoIrv.html">not</a> of any real
benefit to third parties since it too merely <a href="TarrIrv.html">locks in</a>
2-party <a href="Strangle.html">domination</a>.)
</li>
<li>
Jan Kok realized how Range Voting could be done with ordinary plurality-style voting machines.
You can try our <a href="quickdemo/PresRadio.html">demo election</a> to see how easy Range Voting
would be, even on a plurality-style machine.
</li>
<li>
The major parties <i>want</i> range voting in Iowa presidential caucuses:
If (say) the Republicans
get wise and do Range Voting in their Iowa 2008 caucuses then they will get a significantly better
chance to win the presidency, good free publicity, and look like (and genuinely be)
reformers.  All for a total cost and risk of <i>nothing</i>!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
These things meant that we could really realistically hope for reform.
</p>

<p>
So one day I just got
disgusted with the lack of action (or the muddled and sometimes even suicidally stupid
nature of what action there was &ndash; like third parties actually thinking 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>  <!--or  <a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a> -->
would be good for them)
in the world in the voting reform area.  
And I also got disgusted with myself.  Why am I the top expert about this
and I'm doing nothing?  So I decided to found my own group.
</p>

<p>
During that process I also learned about the huge amount of 
<a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>, artificially manipulated 
<a href="Spoiled.html">spoiled ballots</a>, and ludicrous
<a href="BallAccess.html">ballot access restrictions</a> that sully the USA.  We
also want to eliminate them. 
</P>

<p>
I hope it will grow huge and strong and powerful, and that many other people will
take it far beyond my wildest dreams.  Please <a href="ComboEndorse2.html">Endorse</a> us
and/or <a href="voldir/Volunteer.html">join</a> us 
and/or <a href="WaysToHelp.html">help</a> us
and/or join the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">blog</a>.
