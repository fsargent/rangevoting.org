<H2> Example of severe IRV (<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff</a> Voting) misbehavior </H2>

<p><small>By Stephen Unger (emeritus professor, Columbia University, NY)</small></p>

<p>
Previous dramatic IRV 
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">pathologies</a>
have included the following:
</p><ol><li>
The IRV winner is top-ranked by exactly 2 voters (out of 2<sup>k</sup>+1 for
any k&gt;1; there are k+1 candidates running). 
For every other candidate, with one exception, a large supermajority of
voters prefers that candidate over the winner. The IRV
winner is preferred over exactly one other candidate, and this by a
1-vote margin.

E.g. see
<a href="http://www.electology.org/irv-worst-case-scenario">http://www.electology.org/irv-worst-case-scenario</a>.
</small>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
The IRV winner would still be the winner if every voter's expressed
preferences were reversed! 
<blockquote><small>
E.g. see 
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">/IrvRevFail.html</a>.
</small></blockquote>
</li><li>
And here's a nasty combination of many other IRV pathologies all in a single simple
election example:
<blockquote><small>

</small></blockquote>
</li></ol>
<p>
The contribution of this page is to show how <i>both</i> pathologies of types (1) and (2)
can happen simultaneously in a single election example with k+1 candidates
and 2<sup>k</sup>+1 voters.
The simplest example, with k=2,
is shown below, where <b>A wins</b> with either the IRV 
votes shown, or if all votes are reversed.
There are 5=2<sup>2</sup>+1 voters and 3=2+1 candidates (named "A," "B," and "C").
Actually, we scaled up the number of voters to 5000 just to make the point that the problems
here have nothing to do (as one nationally prominent IRV-proponent claimed!)
with the "unrealistically small number of voters," since that can be arbitrarily scaled.
(Similarly one can perturb the numbers, e.g. changing 2000 to 2137, and the pathologies
will still happen.)
Nevertheless this is not a very interesting example.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 2000 </td>
<td align="center"> C &gt; B &gt; A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 1000 </td>
<td align="center">  B &gt; A &gt; C  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 2000 </td>
<td align="center">  A &gt; C &gt; B   </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Two examples are shown below where the numbers are large enough to be
interesting, and to demonstrate how to extend them to arbitrarily higher
numbers. In all cases, A is the winner.
</p>

<p>
<b>For k=6 &nbsp; (7 candidates, 65 voters.</b>
The X's represent "don't care" candidates, i.e. all those
not shown explicitly in
the row.  These can be in any order &ndash; it does not matter which, since the
IRV procedure never examines them.)
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th><th> their vote </th>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 32 </td><td align="center"> G>F>E>D>C>B>A </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 16 </td><td align="center">  F>E>D>C>B>A>G </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 8 </td><td align="center">  E>D>C>B>A>G>F   </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td><td align="center">  D>C>B>A>G>F>E   </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 2 </td><td align="center"> C>B>A>X>X>F>D    </td>

<td align="center"> 1 </td><td align="center"> B>A>X>X>F>D>C    </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 2 </td><td align="center">  A>X>X>X>X>F>B   </td>
</tr></table>

<p>
<b>What happens:</b>
Starting with IRV round #1, candidates B, C, D, E, F, and G are eliminated
in that order, leaving <b>A</b> the winner over G by 33-32 in the final round. 
But in any <i>two</i>-candidate A-versus-somebody IRV election with the preferences
shown above, voters would prefer anybody except G over the winner A
&ndash; indeed always by large majorities, for example D is preferred
over A by 60-to-5.   (A beats G by a single vote.)
</p><p>
For the reverse election (whose purpose is to determine the <i>worst</i> candidate), 
reverse all the "&gt;" signs. 
C is eliminated in IRV round #1, then B, D, and E (as
the votes for F accumulate).  Then G is eliminated, making <b>A</b> the
"winner" by 48-17 over F.  (According to IRV, the "best" candidate is the same as the 
"worst" candidate, refuting claims IRV "elects majority winners" etc.)
In all cases, elimination starts with the next-to-bottom line, 
then proceeds to the bottom line, and then up to
the 3rd line from the bottom and up from there a line at a time until
we skip over the 3rd line from the top to eliminate the second row and
terminate. This should make it clear how larger examples can be
constructed.
</p><p>
Now here is the <b>k=7 case, with 129 voters:</b>
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th><th> their vote </th>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 64 </td><td align="center"> H>G>F>E>D>C>B>A </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 32 </td><td align="center">  G>F>E>D>C>B>A>H  </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 16 </td><td align="center"> F>E>D>C>B>A>H>G  </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 8 </td><td align="center">  E>D>C>B>A>H>G>F   </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 4 </td><td align="center">  D>C>B>A>X>X>G>E  </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 2 </td><td align="center"> C>B>A>X>X>X>G>D  </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 1 </td><td align="center"> B>A>X>X>X>G>D>C   </td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"> 2 </td><td align="center"> A>X>X>X>X>X>G>B   </td>
</tr></table>


<p>
Every candidate except H would have defeated IRV winner A by a large
margin in a 2-candidate election.  For example B would have defeated A
by 127-2. 
A's only pairwise victory would be a 65-64 win over H.
</p><p>
For determining the biggest loser, the candidates eliminated are, in
order, C, B, D, E, F, H before A "defeats" G by 96-33.
</p><p>
Pathologies such as these (many of which, 
<a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">simulations</a> show, can occur
with probabilities far above microscopic) should be enough to persuade
any reasonable person that IRV is off the wall and so should be off
the table. 
And this is apart from the need for <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">central tabulation</a>,
which in my opinion by itself should make IRV unacceptable because it destroys 
election transparency,
thus helping fraudsters.
