<p>
The table below lists all reasonably large countries???
</p><p>
<small>
Countries that are too small exist largely at the pleasure of their far more
powerful neighbors and hence, I think, few <i>internal</i>
political lessons about formation or fall of governments can be learned from them.
In any case, they are omitted.  We also omit mention of short-lived aborted democracies
such as the French Revolution, the
Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic of 1917-1918, 
Azerbaijan Democratic Republic of 1919-1920, etc.

The seven Brazilian constitutions:
<dl>
<dt> Constitution of 1824 </dt><dd>
The first Brazilian constitution, enacted by Dom Pedro I. It was monarchic, hereditary and highly centralized, permitting the vote only to property-holders.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1891 </dt><dd>
The republic was proclaimed in 1889, but a new constitution was not promulgated until 1891. This federalist, democratic constitution was heavily influenced by the U.S. model. However, women and illiterates were not permitted to vote.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1934 </dt><dd>
When G.Vargas came to power in 1930, he canceled the 1891 constitution and did not permit a new one until 1934. The Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 forced Vargas to enact a new democratic constitution that permitted women's suffrage. G.Vargas was elected president by the Constitutional Assembly to a four-year term, beginning in 1933.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1937 </dt><dd>
G.Vargas suppressed a Communist uprising in 1935 and used it as a pretext to establish autocratic rule. He instituted a corporatist constitution nicknamed the polish, written by Francisco Campos.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1946 </dt><dd>
After military coup ousted dictatorial G.Vargas, an Assembly wrote a democratic constitution.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1967 </dt><dd>
After the 1964 military
coup against J.Goulart, the military dictatorship passed the Institutional Acts, a 
supraconstitutional law. This strongly undemocratic constitution simply incorporated these Acts.
   </dd><dt> Constitution of 1988 </dt><dd>
The progressive redemocratization culminated in the current constitution. Very democratic, it is more expansive than a normal constitution  many statutory acts in other countries are written into this constitution, like Social Security and taxes.

The Communist Party voluntarily gave up its monopoly on power in 1990, 
and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 took place, won by the 
moderate wing of the Communist Party, renamed the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). 
In 1991 the country adopted a new constitution which provided for a relatively 
weak elected President and for a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature.

A military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of great

Eventualy de facto dictator General Ibanez del Campo
peacefully gave up power to a democratically elected successor.
A CIA-aided coup ended that
democracy in 1973 and gave power to the military under dictator-general Pinochet.
It gradually liberalized in the 1980s and 
in a 1988 plebiscite Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president (56% against 44%)

There was a brief abortive democracy 1946-1948 which ended in Communist coup in 1948
and then became dominated by the USSR which put down the "Prague spring"
by force in 1968.
In 1990 the peaceful 
"Velvet Revolution"  (mass protests, geenral strike, shut down the gov.)
restored democracy and a peaceful split occurred in 1993
into several countries, e.g. Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Denmark
</td><td>
Constitutional monarchy. Monarch not answerable for his or her actions,
and appoints and dismisses the Prime and other Ministers.
Legislative authority is vested in the monarch and the Danish parliament conjointly. 
The judiciary is independent.  
The constitution does not grant the judiciary power of judicial review of legislation, 
but the courts have asserted this power with the consent of the other branches of government.
Peacefully entered this system in 1849.  The Monarch has not exercised any power since 
dismissing the PM in 1920 ("Easter crisis").
He was then forced by fear of revolution to undo that a few days later, but theoretically
retains power.  On the other hand the parliament theoretically has "sovereignity"
over all the other branches and hence has the power to remove the Monarch's power.

France
</td><td>
French Revolution (1789-1799) tried to birth democratic principles but ultimately became
a very bloody failure which merely installed the
Emperor Napoleon who initiated continent-wide war.  
Following Napoleon's defeat 1815, French monarchy was
re-established but with
constitutional limitations.  The 1848 "July revolution" established "Second Republic,"
a new try at democracy.  It failed again with the rise of a new Napoleon in 1851.
Louis Napoleon's reign ended with the 1870 Franco-Prussian war at which point the Third Republic
was created.  It managed to last for 70 years of mediocre bumbling corruption before falling
to the Nazi invasion of 1940.  After WW II ended, the Fourth republic was
set up, and was repealed by a constitutional rewrite &ndash; the Fifth Republic &ndash; in 1958.
The Fifth Republic featured a strong president with a 7-year term,
popularly elected by a 2-round runoff.  
This was the first clearly successful French democracy.

Parliamentary federal republic set up by conquering Allies after WW II.

Earlier experiment with democracy, the Weimer Republic (1919-1933)
was set up after the (small) "German Revolution" (more of a sailor's mutiny).

After a coup which killed about 100 people, the military junta
set up a democracy with the first election won by exile J.A.Bermejo.
In 1954 his elecgted successor Jacobo Arbenz
was overthrown by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a 
small group of Guatemalans (landowners, the old military caste, and the Catholic Church), 
after the government instituted decree No. 900, which expropriated large 
tracts of land owned by the United Fruit Company, a U.S.-based banana 
merchant (Chiquita Banana). The CIA codename for the coup was Operation PBSUCCESS.
Repressive military rule using death-squads followed.  
By Castillo Armas was assassinated by a member of his personal guard in 1957
and a lot of unstable pseudo-democracy fraught with armed conflicts then ensued.

Became Republic &ndash; constitutional democracy, the largest in the world &ndash;
in 1950.  Democracy was ended by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975
after a court ruled she was elected with the aid of fraud; she responded by
refusing to step down,
jailing thousands of both her political rivals and
journalists she disliked, dissolving many state governments, cutting off
electricity to opposition media,
and terminating democracy in favor of
rule by decree.  Fortunately (and perhaps unexpectedly) the resulting period of
authoritarian rule only lasted 19 months.

Early oligarchic-democratic city-state republics
included Florence (ostensibly a democracy but which became 
dominated behind the scenes by the Medici family), Venice (&asymp;850-1797), 
Genoa (&asymp;1100-1381) &ndash; both of which were somewhat democratic &ndash; Pisa, and Amalfi.
By banding together, Italy's city-states were able to resist foreign invaders.
However eventually Italy fell under foreign domination.
A later democracy became dominated 1922-1926
by fascist Benito Mussolini, largely by legal means,
but gradually transforming Italy into a dictatorship under him.  
Opposition parties were banned in 1926.
That
ended in world war II.
The First Republic (1946-1992) then was set up.  The Second Republic (1992-)
was really the same government but a drastic reorganization and reshuffling
of the political parties occurred and major reforms were enacted by referendum.
