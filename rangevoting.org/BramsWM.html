<p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.7em"> <strong>Approval Voting:
        A Better Way to Select a Winner</strong></p>
      <p><em>by Steven J. Brams '62</em></p>

      <p>It may come as a surprise to many that there is a science of elections, 
        whose provenance can be traced back to several important theorists, including: 
        1) the Marquis de Condorcet in 18th-century France; 2) Charles Dodgson 
        (Lewis Carroll) in 19th-century England; and 3) Kenneth Arrow in 20th-century 
        America. Since Arrow published his seminal book, <em>Social Choice and 
        Individual Values</em>, 51 years ago -- for which in large part he received 
        the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1972 -- there have been thousands 
        of articles and hundreds of books published on everything from the mathematical 
        properties of voting systems to empirical tests of the propensity of different 
        systems to elect centrist candidates. </p>
      <p>The 2000 U.S. presidential election highlighted, among other things,
        the frailties of voting machines and the seeming arbitrariness of such
        venerable U.S. institutions as the Electoral College and the Supreme Court.
        Political commentary has focused on these aspects but given little attention
        to alternative voting systems, about which the science of elections has
        much to say.</p>
      <p>Several alternative systems for electing a single winner have been shown 
        to be far superior to plurality voting (PV), our current system. PV, which 
        allows citizens to vote for only one candidate, suffers from a dismaying 
        flaw. In any race with more than two candidates, PV may elect the candidate 
        least acceptable to the majority of voters. This frequently happens in 
        a three-way contest, when the majority splits its votes between two centrist 
        candidates, allowing a more extreme candidate to win. PV also forces minor-party 
        candidates into the role of spoilers, as we saw in 2000, which can be 
        decisive in a close contest between the major-party candidates. </p>
      <p>Of the alternatives to PV, I recommend approval voting (AV) on both practical 
        and theoretical grounds. Proposed independently by several analysts in 
        the 1970s, AV is a voting procedure in which voters can vote for, or "approve 
        of," as many candidates as they wish in multicandidate elections -- that 
        is, elections with more than two candidates. Each candidate approved of 
        receives one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins. </p>
      <p>In the United States, the case for AV seems particularly strong in primary
        and nonpartisan elections, which often draw large fields of candidates:</p>
      <p>1. <em>It gives voters more flexible options.</em> They can do everything 
        they can under PV -- vote for a single favorite -- but if they have no 
        strong preference for one candidate, they can express this fact by voting 
        for all candidates they find acceptable. In addition, if a voter's most 
        preferred candidate has little chance of winning, that voter can vote 
        for both a first choice and a more viable candidate without worrying about 
        wasting his or her vote on the less popular candidate.</p>
      <p>2. <em>It helps elect the strongest candidate.</em> Today the candidate
        supported by the largest minority often wins, or at least makes the runoff
        if there is one. Under AV, by contrast, the candidate with the greatest
        overall support will generally win. In particular, &quot;Condorcet
        candidates,&quot; who can defeat every other candidate in separate pairwise
        contests, almost always win under AV, whereas under PV they often lose
        because they split the vote with one or more other centrist candidates.
<small>[Editor's note: "almost always" was too strong: three of the five 2001-2005
<a href="Debian2003.html">Debian leader</a> elections 
featured different Approval and Condorcet winners.  But certainly Condorcet winners
are more common with AV than PV.]</small>
      </p>
      <p>3. <em>It will reduce negative campaigning.</em> AV induces candidates
        to try to mirror the views of a majority of voters, not just cater to
        minorities whose voters could give them a slight edge in a crowded plurality
        contest. It is thus likely to cut down on negative campaigning, because
        candidates will have an incentive to try to broaden their appeals by reaching
        out for approval to voters who might have a different first choice. Lambasting
        such a choice would risk alienating this candidate's supporters and losing
        their approval.
<small>[Editor's note: This claim may have validity but
is not supported by any evidence I know of.  And indeed there is some 
evidence against it.  Specifically, J.H.Nagel has complained about a flaw in AV he calls
<a href="BurrSummary.html">Burr's Dilemma</a> which involves exactly this kind
of quandary.]</small>
</p>
      <p>4. <em>It will increase voter turnout.</em> By being better able to express
        their preferences, voters are more likely to vote in the first place.
        Voters who think they might be wasting their votes under PV, or who cannot decide
        which of several candidates best represents their views, will not have
        to despair about making a choice. By not being forced to make a single--perhaps
        arbitrary--choice, they will feel that the election system allows them
        to be more honest, which will make voting more meaningful and encourage
        greater participation in elections.
<small>[Editor's note: This claim <a href="NonVoters.html">probably is true</a> but
is not supported by direct evidence.]
</small>
</p>
      <p>5.<em> It will give minority candidates their proper due.</em> Minority
        candidates will not suffer under AV: their supporters will not be torn
        away simply because there is another candidate who, though less appealing
        to them, is generally considered a stronger contender. Because AV allows
        these supporters to vote for <em>both</em> candidates, they will not be tempted
        to desert the one who is weak in the polls, as under PV. Hence, minority
        candidates will receive their true level of support under AV, even if
        they cannot win. This will make election returns a better reflection of
        the overall acceptability of candidates, relatively undistorted by strategic
        voting, which is important information often denied to voters today. 
<small>[Editor's note: AV is more friendly to minority candidates than PV, but
still "fails to give them their proper due," i.e. still distorts the vote totals
heavily against them, in the sense 
that <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> experimentally gives such candidates 
<a href="PsEl04.html">far higher</a> vote counts.]
</small></p>
      <p>6.<em> It is eminently practicable.</em> Unlike more complicated ranking
        systems, which suffer from a variety of theoretical as well as practical
        defects, AV is simple for voters to understand and use. Although more
        votes must be tallied under AV than under PV, AV can readily be implemented
        on existing voting machines. Because AV does not violate any state constitutions
        in the United States (or, for that matter, the constitutions of most countries
        in the world), it requires only an ordinary statute to enact.</p>
      <p>Voting systems that involve ranking candidates may appear, at first blush, 
        more appealing than AV. One, the Borda count, awards points to candidates 
        according to their ranking. Another is the Hare system of single transferable 
        vote (sometimes called &quot;instant runoff&quot;), in which candidates 
        receiving the fewest first-choice votes are progressively eliminated and 
        their votes transferred to second choices -- and lower choices if necessary 
        -- until one candidate emerges with a majority. </p>
      <p>Compared with AV, these systems have serious drawbacks. The Borda count 
        fosters &quot;insincere voting&quot; (for example, ranking a second choice 
        at the bottom if that candidate is considered the strongest threat to 
        one's top choice) and is also vulnerable to &quot;irrelevant candidates&quot; 
        who cannot win but can affect the outcome. The Hare system may eliminate 
        a centrist candidate early on and thereby elect one less acceptable to 
        the majority. It suffers also from &quot;nonmonotonicity,&quot; in which 
        voters, by raising the ranking of a candidate, may actually cause that 
        candidate to lose -- just the opposite of what one would want to happen. 
      </p>
      <p>Probably the best-known official elected by AV today is the secretary-general
        of the United Nations. AV has been used in internal elections by the political
        parties in some states, such as Pennsylvania, where a presidential straw
        poll using AV was conducted by the Democratic State Committee in 1983.
        Bills to implement AV have been introduced in several state legislatures.
        In 1987, a bill to enact AV in certain statewide elections passed the
        Senate but not the House in North Dakota. In 1990, Oregon used AV in a
        statewide advisory referendum on school financing, which presented voters
        with five different options and allowed them to vote for as many as they
        wished. </p>
      <p>In the late 1980s, AV was used in some competitive elections in countries
        in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, where it was effectively &quot;disapproval
        voting&quot; because voters were permitted to cross off names on ballots
        but not to vote for candidates. But this procedure is logically equivalent
        to AV: candidates not crossed off are, in effect, approved of, although
        psychologically there is almost surely a difference between approving
        and disapproving of candidates. </p>
      <p>Beginning in 1987, several scientific and engineering societies adopted
        AV. It has worked well in finding consensus candidates; all these societies
        continue to use it today and include the following:</p>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bodyText">Mathematical Association of America (MAA),
          with about 32,000 members;</span></li>
        <li><span class="bodyText">American Mathematical Society (AMS), with about
          30,000 members;</span></li>
        <li><span class="bodyText">Institute for Operations Research and Management
          Sciences (INFORMS), with about 12,000 members;</span></li>
        <li><span class="bodyText">American Statistical Association (ASA), with
          about 15,000 members;</span></li>
        <li><span class="bodyText">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
          (IEEE), with about 377,000 members. <small>[Editor's note: The IEEE went 
<a href="BackSlide.html">back</a> to plurality voting in 2002.]</small>
</span></ul>


      <p>Smaller societies that use AV include the Society for Judgment and Decision
        Making, the Social Choice and Welfare Society, the International Joint
        Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and the European Association for
        Logic, Language and Information. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the Econometric Society has used AV (with certain emendations) 
        to elect fellows since 1980; likewise, since 1981 the selection of members 
        of the National Academy of Sciences at the final stage of balloting has 
        been based on AV. Coupled with many colleges and universities that now 
        use AV -- from the departmental level to the school-wide level -- it is 
        no exaggeration to say that several hundred thousand individuals have 
        had direct experience with AV. </p>
      <p>As cherished a principle as &quot;one person, one vote&quot; is in single-winner 
        elections, such as for president, it is probably an anachronism today. 
        In my opinion, democracies can more benefit from the alternative principle 
        of &quot;one candidate, one vote,&quot; whereby voters make judgments 
        about whether each candidate on the ballot is acceptable or not.</p>
      <p>The latter principle makes the tie-in of a vote not to the voter but
        rather to the candidates, which is arguably more egalitarian than artificially
        restricting voters to casting only one vote in multicandidate races. This
        principle also affords voters an opportunity to express their intensities
        of preference by approving of, for example, all candidates except the
        one they despise. </p>
      <p>Although AV encourages sincere voting, it does not altogether eliminate 
        strategic calculations. Because approval of a less-preferred candidate 
        can hurt a more-preferred approved candidate, the voter is still faced 
        with the decision of where to draw the line between acceptable and nonacceptable 
        candidates. A rational voter will vote for a second choice if his or her 
        first choice appears to be a long shot--as indicated, for example, by 
        polls -- but the voter's calculus and its effects on outcomes is not yet 
        well understood for either AV or other voting procedures. </p>
      <p>While AV is a strikingly simple election reform for finding consensus 
        choices in single-winner elections, in elections with more than one winner 
        -- such as for a council or a legislature -- AV would not be desirable 
        if the goal is to mirror a diversity of views, especially of minorities; 
        for this purpose, other voting systems should be considered. On the other 
        hand, minorities may derive indirect benefit from AV in single-winner 
        elections, because mainstream candidates, in order to win, will be forced 
        to reach out to minority voters for the approval they (the mainstream 
        candidates) need to win. While promoting majoritarian candidates, therefore, 
        AV induces them to be responsive to minority views. <br>
