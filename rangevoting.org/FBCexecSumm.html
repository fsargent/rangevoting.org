<H2> "Favorite Betrayal" &ndash; Executive Summary </H2>

<p>
An election is said to exhibit "favorite betrayal" if
some set of voters would have gotten a better election result
("better" in their view) by <i>not</i> voting their honest favorite top.
A voting method enjoys the "FBC property" if no election
(with that voting method) exhibits favote betrayal.
</p>
<p>
We've come a long way since
the days when range and approval voting were the only known methods
in which betraying your favorite is strategically avoidable.
Now many other methods also are known with that "FBC property."
Many of them were invented by Kevin Venzke.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
However, it appears Range and Approval satisfy FBC in a stronger and more
obvious sense than these other methods. Specifically, with Range and Approval,
betraying your favorite simply never is useful. With the other methods
it <i>can</i> be strategically useful (cause X to win instead of Y, where the
betrayers
prefer X) <i>but</i> if so there is always a way to get the same effect (i.e. make X
win)
by some other dishonest vote <i>not</i> involving favorite betrayal.
</li><li>
Also, all the FBC-obeying methods surveyed seem vulnerable to
<a href="CandCloning.html">candidate-cloning</a> election-manipulation
attempts <i>except</i> for range (and in a weaker sense approval) voting.
This leads to the very interesting
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Conjecture:</b>
<i>Continuum Range Voting (and its obvious variants)
are the <u>only</u> FBC-obeying
voting methods immune to candidate-cloning (with voters assumed to have tiny
preferences among the clones).
</i>
</p>
<p>
This conjecture has now been <a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">largely proven</a>.
