<H2> Candidate cloning </H2>

(<a href="CandCloneSumm.html">Executive summary</a>)
</small></p>

<blockquote>
John Dendahl, chairman of the New Mexico Republican Party,
quietly offered "more than $100,000" to the Green Party <i>if</i> they
would run candidates in NM's first and second Congressional Districts.
The Greens were relatively strong in New Mexico and had already been spoilers in local races.
The difference was that the Republicans were now willing to pay cash for services
that had previously been free.
<br>
&mdash; W.Poundstone: <i>Gaming The Vote</i>, Hill &amp; Wang 2008, p.110.
(This was in July 2002.
Later, the Greens reported that the offer was $250,000.
Dendahl told CNN
that he got the money and instructions from "somebody in Washington" but refused
to say who.)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In the June 2006 special election for the Congressman from California's 15th district,
Republican Brian
Bilbray was a foaming-at-the-mouth anti-immigration hawk who supported building
a fence clear from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico... in one of his ads he was shown
driving a bulldozer, keeping "Tijuana sewage" off California's beaches.
William Griffith, a Republican running independent using $2000 of his own money, 
claimed to be even <i>more</i>
anti-immigrant than Bilbray.  How that was possible was unclear.
<br>
Then something odd happened.  Phone calls started urging voters to vote for Griffith.
Radio ads too.   Griffith didn't know who was behind them.
Both later turned out to have been funded by Democratic candidate Francine Busby.
&mdash; W.Poundstone: <i>Gaming The Vote</i>, p.120, paraphrased.

<blockquote>
Despite having $21 million in campaign cash,
Pennsylvania's Republican uber-hawk Senator Rick Santorum 
had a tough race for re-election
in 2006 against Democrat Bob Casey.  
A May 2006 SurveyUSA poll had found him the least popular US senator.
(Santorum claimed in June 2006 to have seen secret documents showing
the USA had finally located Saddam Hussein's "weapons of mass destruction."
But neither Santorum, nor anybody else, ever revealed those locations.)
<br>
But the candidate having a <i>really</i> tough time was the Green Party's 
Carl Romanelli. He had almost no money and needed 67070 signatures to get on ballot.
There were only 20000  Green party members in Pennsylvania.
Santorum and Romanelli had diametrically-opposite stances on Iraq, abortion, and
gun control.   
<br>
Suddenly, Romanelli's funding increased by a <i>factor</i> of 2000.   All of it
came from (what the press identified as) GOP/conservative donors (some crudely
disguised) and was funneled
to a signature-collecting company.   
<br>
&mdash; W.Poundstone: <i>Gaming The Vote</i>, p.124, paraphrased.  (Poundstone estimates
that Santorum, by donating money to Romanelli, effectively got about 15 times more
votes-versus-Casey per dollar than if he'd spent it directly on his own campaign.)

Nicolaus Tideman
emphasized the importance of making election methods "immune to candidate cloning"
in his work.
</p>

<p>
In plurality voting,
introducing an extra candidate who is enough like
another, can paradoxically cause <i>both</i> to <i>lose</i>
(because the vote gets split among the clones) &ndash;
even if the voters really like the point of view they (both) represent!
<i>The very popularity of a view can cause its defeat!</i>
</p>

<p>
Is that "democracy" or "a joke"?
</p>

<p>
This effect has even caused parties to intentionally aid <i>opponents</i> of
their point of view ("helping a spoiler")!  And it also has (more often) caused
parties to intentionally hurt <i>allies</i> of their point of view!
</p>

<p>
<a href="rangeVborda.html#clones">Borda voting</a>
suffers from the opposite problem &ndash; "teaming" &ndash;
a party could (if elections were conducted by Borda voting) win 
by simply sponsoring lots and lots of clones of their candidate to enter the race,
which would artificially "magnify" his advantage.  What a joke!
</p>

<p>
Range voting is immune to cloning &ndash; so such boorish election manipulation
attempts just won't work under range voting.  (Don't think this really matters?
Wrong &ndash; check out the enormous distortion that occurred in this
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">French Election</a>.) So we can concentrate
on who is the best candidate instead of who uses the most Machiavellian
tactics.
