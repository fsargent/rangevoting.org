<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">INTRODUCTION </font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Majority rule is a basic principle of
democratic elections in the United States. (2) Candidates who win with majority support
possess a clear mandate from the electorate and increase their own legitimacy as leaders
of the people. (3) Yet, majority winners have become less common during the last decade,
as the number of plurality winners increased in both federal and state elections. (4) The
winners of three of the last four presidential elections, as well as thirteen currently
serving governors, have failed to receive a majority of the votes cast. (5) Compounding
this problem is the fact that usually less than half of the eligible electorate
participates in elections. (6) As a result, the current electoral system in the United
States often results in minority rule, with many elected officials winning their jobs with
the support of merely a plurality of the minority of citizens. It comes as no surprise
that many citizens have become cynical about the electoral process. (7) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting (8) is an electoral
reform gaining momentum in state legislatures (9) that aims to ensure majority rule. (10)
The recent increase in interest in adopting instant runoff voting in national, state, and
local elections is a response to problems in the current electoral system that need to be
remedied. Instant runoff voting initiatives, however, will face difficulties in complying
with many state electoral statutes because they do not result in &quot;majority
winners,&quot; as that phrase is traditionally defined. Even if instant runoff voting can
clear this substantial statutory hurdle, the potential benefits of this reform do not
outweigh its potential side effects. Therefore, state and local governments should refrain
from passing instant runoff voting legislation until these problems are addressed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Part I of this Note explains instant runoff
voting and describes recent instant runoff voting legislation passed across the United
States. Part II discusses instant runoff voting's compatibility, or lack thereof, with
state election statutes and state constitutions. Parts III and IV delve into the policy
implications of enacting instant runoff voting. Part III analyzes the potential benefits
of instant runoff voting put forth by its supporters, including increasing the legitimacy
of elected officials, eliminating the &quot;spoiler problem,&quot; saving money, and
increasing voter turnout. Part IV considers the arguments of the detractors of instant
runoff voting: voter confusion and election security. As a result of each of these
discussions, this Note concludes that legislatures should refrain from implementing
instant runoff voting because of the confusion, uncertainty, and instability it would
likely create. </font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">I. BACKGROUND </font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Plurality voting, a voting system in which
the person who receives the most votes wins, is currently the predominate form of voting
in the United States. (11) In contrast to this traditional electoral system, in an instant
runoff voting system, voters rank candidates--as first, second, third and so on--according
to their preferences. Initially, only the first place votes are counted. If one candidate
receives a majority of the first place votes cast, that candidate is declared the winner
of the election. (12) Up to this point, votes are counted in the exact same fashion as a
traditional plurality/majority election. If no candidate receives a majority of first
place votes, however, an instant runoff voting system requires that there be a second
round of vote counting. In this second round, the candidate with the fewest first place
votes is eliminated. The second place votes of the voters who chose the last place
candidate as their first choice are then redistributed among the remaining candidates. If
one of the remaining candidates has still not received a majority of the votes, (13) the
next lowest vote getter from the previous round is newly eliminated, and the second place
votes of the voters who chose the eliminated candidate are then redistributed among the
remaining candidates. (14) This process continues until one candidate receives a
preferential majority. (15) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Many legislatures have recently considered
implementing instant runoff voting. In 2003 alone, eighteen state legislatures considered
bills proposing the implementation of instant runoff voting. (16) Two additional states
considered bills in 2001 (17) and Alaska held the first statewide vote on whether to
implement instant runoff voting in August of 2002. (18) Although most of these state bills
failed, many were carried over to the next legislative session and are still pending. (19)
The Maine legislature passed a law directing the Secretary of State to perform a study on
the feasibility of establishing instant runoff voting. (20) In addition, the Louisiana
legislature implemented instant runoff voting for military and overseas ballots. (21) On
the municipal level, voters in many cities and towns have passed charter amendments
permitting the use of instant runoff voting. (22) The U.S. Congress has recently
considered instant runoff voting as well. In January 2003, Congress introduced a bill that
called for the creation of a commission to analyze &quot;alternative methods of electing
House Members,&quot; including instant runoff voting. (23) Two other instant runoff voting
bills were introduced in 2001. (24) </font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">II. THE LEGALITY OF INSTANT RUNOFF
VOTING </font></strong></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A. State Election Laws </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting must be consistent with
a state's electoral laws in order for it to be implemented. Ironically, instant runoff
voting's greatest apparent strength, its proclaimed ability to create majority winners in
an election, may actually be the biggest impediment to its implementation. Many state
constitutions and election laws require candidates to receive a majority of the votes cast
in order to win an election. (25) A preferential majority in an instant runoff voting
election, however, is not the same as a majority in a traditional election because
preferential majorities combine first-place and non-first-place votes to obtain a
&quot;majority.&quot; &quot;Majority in the 'classic' sense ... consists of more than half
of the original votes ... cast and not re-assigned by the voter's secondary or tertiary
intent.&quot; (26) As a result, how the term &quot;majority&quot; is interpreted in the
context of state laws and constitutions will determine the legality of instant runoff
voting in various jurisdictions. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">1. State Election Laws Inconsistent with
Instant Runoff Voting </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In some states, such as Washington, instant
runoff voting is clearly inconsistent with state electoral law. (27) Washington law
requires cities to hold primary elections to decide which two candidates will compete in a
November general election. (28) The city of Vancouver, Washington, approved instant runoff
voting in 1999; (29) an action that would have eliminated primary elections in violation
of Washington election law. As a result, the city was unable to proceed with instant
runoff elections without a change to state electoral laws. Attempts to change Washington
election laws to bring them into compliance with instant runoff voting have thus far been
unsuccessful. (30) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Efforts to implement instant runoff voting in
Texas have also been stymied by legal concerns. The Texas Secretary of State determined
that the city of Austin may not implement instant runoff voting because it does not
provide for majority winners as required by section 275.002 of the Texas Election Code.
(31) This statute states that &quot;[t]o be elected to a city office, a candidate must
receive a majority of the total number of votes received by all candidates for the
office.&quot; (32) Although the Texas Secretary of State's Office conceded that the term
&quot;majority&quot; could theoretically include a preferential majority, it determined
that the Texas Election Code requires &quot;traditional&quot; majorities. (33) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In making its determination, the Secretary of
State's Office looked at how the word &quot;majority&quot; is used in other parts of the
Texas Code and how the term has been interpreted by courts. (34) In effect, the Secretary
of State's Office followed section 311.023 of the Texas Government Code, which directs
courts on the proper interpretation of statutes. This statute states that &quot;[i]n
construing a statute ... a court may consider among other matters the ... legislative
history [and] common law or former statutory provisions, including laws on the same or
similar subjects....&quot; (35) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Under its state election laws, Texas requires
a traditional runoff election if there is no majority winner, (36) which indicates that
the Texas legislature did not intend for a mere preferential majority to suffice for a
candidate to win office. In addition, the Secretary of State looked to legislative history
to determine the meaning of &quot;majority.&quot; The Texas Election Code at one time
included a &quot;preferential vote alternative,&quot; but the Legislature deleted that
language from the Code in 1985. (37) As a result, the Texas Secretary of State's Office
declared that it was &quot;reluctant to read preferential voting back into the Code by
administrative interpretation when the legislative context does not otherwise support that
conclusion.&quot; (38) As such, the Secretary of State determined that the term
&quot;majority&quot; is consistently used in the Texas Election Code to mean
&quot;traditional,&quot; rather than &quot;preferential,&quot; majorities. (39) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">2. State Election Laws More Favorable to
Instant Runoff Voting </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In contrast to Texas and Washington, the
election laws of some states expressly authorize the use of preferential voting systems
such as instant runoff voting. In Michigan, for example, preferential voting is expressly
authorized by law. (40) Specifically, the law states that &quot;[e]lections may be by a
partisan, nonpartisan, or preferential ballot, or by any other legal method of
voting.&quot; (41) In accordance with this statute, Michigan courts have upheld voting
systems involving &quot;preferential&quot; majorities. (42) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">The election laws of some other states,
although not explicitly authorizing preferential voting systems, grant broad authority for
municipalities to implement alternative voting systems such as instant runoff voting. For
example, California law allows a city to amend its charter to provide for the election of
officers by whatever &quot;proportion&quot; the city chooses. (43) California law also
explicitly allows cities to create their own voting methods. (44) Similar statutory
language in Texas would likely have led the Texas Secretary of State to approve
preferential voting in Austin and other Texas cities. (45) The experiences of Austin,
Texas, and Vancouver, Washington, should serve as warnings for state and municipal
officials considering instant runoff voting. Although alternative voting methods are
explicitly allowed in some states, state electoral laws mandating primaries and majorities
could derail efforts to implement instant runoff voting. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">State election laws are not the only legal
hurdle facing implementation of instant runoff voting at the state level. Instant runoff
voting is variably compatible with state constitutions in the same way that it is variably
compatible with state election laws. As the following discussion illustrates, several
state constitutional provisions could block an instant runoff voting initiative from being
enacted, unless it was implemented through the difficult constitutional amendment process.
</font></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">B. State Constitutions (46) </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">State constitutions present an obstacle to
instant runoff voting in many states. Most state constitutions mandate that the winner of
an election for governor, and often other state executive branch offices, is the candidate
who receives the most votes. (47) Thus, these states do not require a gubernatorial
candidate to receive a majority of the votes cast in order to win an election. (48) If an
instant runoff voting statute for such offices was enacted, a state constitutional
challenge would likely ensue. A candidate who received a plurality of first-place votes,
but then lost the election after second- and third-place votes were counted, would
probably challenge the instant runoff voting statute. (49) Such a candidate would claim
that he or she did receive the most votes, by earning the plurality of first-place votes,
as was intended by the drafters of the state constitution, and that the instant runoff
voting statute inserted a majority requirement although none exists in the state
constitution. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A hypothetical is useful to explain how
instant runoff voting could violate state constitutions that provide that the winning
candidate is the candidate who receives the most votes. Suppose that there are four
candidates for governor: D from the Democratic Party, G from the Green Party, L from the
Libertarian Party, and R from the Republican Party. After counting the number of
first-place votes in an election, no candidate has a majority, and the results are as
follows: D has the most votes, R the second most, G the third most, and L the least. If
instant runoff voting procedures are followed, L would be eliminated and the ballots cast
for L would be redistributed to the remaining three candidates according to the
second-place votes indicated on the L ballots. Suppose that virtually all of the L ballots
ranked R as their second choice, giving R a preferential majority. R would be declared the
winner according to the instant runoff voting system. Consequently, the candidate with the
most first-place votes, D, would not win and would likely challenge the instant runoff
voting statute as violative of the state constitution. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In a few other states, instant runoff voting
would prompt another constitutional challenge by depriving candidates of a
constitutionally mandated process whereby the state legislature must make the final
determination as to the winner of an election. Currently, Vermont's constitution requires
the state legislature, by secret ballot, to decide state-wide elections if no candidate
receives a traditional majority in the general election. (50) There is currently
disagreement among Vermont's elected officials as to how instant runoff voting would
comport with this provision. Vermont's Secretary of State has issued a press releases
urging the legislature to pass a bill implementing instant runoff voting in state-wide
elections. (51) Vermont's Attorney General, however, believes that an instant runoff
voting bill would be unconstitutional. (52) This argument stems from the fact that instant
runoff voting would deny a candidate who finished in second or third place in the general
election from being considered by the state legislature, as the Vermont Constitution
instructs, because instant runoff voting procedures would supplant any need for such a
vote by the legislature. Consequently, it is likely that a losing candidate under an
instant runoff system would challenge the constitutionality of a law that denies that
person his or her right to consideration by the state legislature. </font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">III. POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF ENACTING
INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING </font></strong></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A. &quot;Preferential&quot; Majority
Winners: A Clearer Mandate and Increased Legitimacy? </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Virtually all elections in the United States
are single-member district contests in which the candidate who receives the most votes
wins. (53) It is logical to infer that the greater the percentage of votes a candidate
receives, the clearer the mandate he or she has from the electorate and the more
legitimacy he or she has to lead and represent his or her constituents. (54) A candidate's
failure to achieve a majority, however, can have detrimental effects: &quot;When people
see our highest officials being elected to office with not even a bare majority of support
from the voters it is not surprising that voters get cynical.&quot; (55) Therefore,
majority winners are preferable to plurality winners, because they are better able to
claim a mandate and appear legitimate. (56) As a result, a majority winner's party
platform will be more powerful and the policymaking process will have a clearer direction
during that person's administration. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">1. An Increasing Number of Plurality Winners </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Although some states require that candidates
receive a majority of votes to be elected, (57) most states allow plurality winners. (58)
The number of plurality winners in both federal and state elections increased throughout
the 1990s. (59) Only one of the previous four presidential election winners received
majority support from the nation as a whole. (60) Furthermore, in 1992, Bill Clinton
received only a plurality of the vote in most of the states that he won. (61) Thirteen
currently serving governors have also failed to receive a majority of the votes cast in
their respective elections. (62) Not surprisingly, lower state office elections also
frequently result in plurality winners. (63) The increasing number of plurality-winner
elections could serve to decrease public confidence in government by justifiably creating
the sense that a minority is governing the majority. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A plurality-winner system, operating within a
system of low voter turnout, further decreases the mandate and legitimacy of elected
officials. Less than half of the eligible electorate voted in a recent presidential
election, and the turnout has been even lower in nonpresidential years. (64) Therefore,
the current electoral system actually results in minority rule, as many officials are
elected with the support of only a plurality of the minority of citizens who actually
voted. Even in President Clinton's landslide victory in 1996, he received votes from only
twenty-four percent of eligible voters--which was approximately forty-nine percent of the
forty-nine percent of eligible voters who actually voted. (65) Instant runoff voting
offers some hope of increasing public confidence in government by electing officials with
at least preferential majorities. However, as the following section indicates, any
improvement would only be at the margins. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">2. A Marginally Clearer Mandate </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">An instant runoff voting system will come
closer to electing officials with the support of a majority of voters than a plurality
system, but it will still not create true majority winners. In an instant runoff election
system, it is still likely that a majority of voters will not have voted for the winning
candidate as their first choice. In addition, obtaining a majority with second- or
third-place votes is not the same as winning a majority with all first-place votes in a
traditional runoff election. A majority created with the help of second-, third- or even
fourth-place votes creates a less powerful mandate and less legitimacy than traditional
majorities do. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Clearly, there is a difference between
traditional majorities and preferential majorities under an instant runoff system. Even
supporters of instant runoff voting recognize that preferential majorities are only
&quot;something like&quot; majority rule. (66) Being the first choice of a majority of the
voters creates greater legitimacy than receiving a preferential majority made up of votes
from an enthusiastic plurality combined with &quot;the grudging acceptance&quot; of a
minority who is merely &quot;settl[ing]&quot; for a candidate. (67) A preferential
majority winner cannot claim that most voters believe his or her platform should be
implemented, and therefore the legitimacy of an official elected under an instant runoff
system will be only marginally increased over that of an official elected by a plurality. </font></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">B. Instant Runoff Voting and the
&quot;Spoiler Problem&quot; </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Perhaps the clearest justification for
adopting an instant runoff voting system is its ability to eliminate what many view as the
&quot;spoiler problem.&quot; In political contests with multiple candidates, aspiring
office holders who draw their support from similar constituencies may in effect cancel
each other out, and thus allow a candidate with less overall support to win. (68) The
decline of the power of political parties during the last century has increased the
likelihood of this scenario. (69) Although an instant runoff voting system would alleviate
the &quot;spoiler problem,&quot; it is not at all clear that it is a problem that needs to
be fixed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy in the
2000 presidential election is an often cited instance of the &quot;spoiler problem.&quot;
(70) &quot;Spoiler problems&quot; are common at the state level as well. For example, a
strong Green Party showing in the 1998 race for the U.S. House of Representatives in New
Mexico's First District contributed to a Republican victory there. (71) In Alaska, support
for Libertarian and Alaskan Independence Party candidates has led to plurality Democratic
Party victories. (72) In Vermont, strong support for Progressive Party and Independent
candidates led to plurality Republican Party victories in the 2002 elections for governor
and lieutenant governor. (73) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Not surprisingly, the Democratic Party in
Alaska and the Republican Party in New Mexico and Vermont have opposed efforts to
implement instant runoff voting. (74) These parties recognize that if recent voting trends
remain constant, their candidates would be less likely than their opponents' candidates to
be the first or second choice of a majority of the voters. Accordingly, under an instant
runoff voting system, candidates from these parties would be at a disadvantage as compared
to their current political situation. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Although three-way races in traditional
plurality electoral systems create what many call &quot;spoilers,&quot; this situation is
not necessarily bad. Ralph Nader's success in winning nearly three percent of the national
vote, and over five percent of the vote in eleven states, (75) may not show a weakness in
the traditional electoral system, but rather weaknesses with Nader's major party
opponents. Seen in this light, Al Gore did not lose the election because of Ralph Nader;
he lost because of Al Gore. (76) In fact, had Nader not run, most Nader voters would have
voted for someone other than Gore, or not voted at all. (77) From this, it can be inferred
that it was not Nader's candidacy that lost the election for Gore, it was Gore's inability
to satisfactorily address the needs of Nader voters. Nader's 2000 presidential campaign,
as well as Ross Perot's 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns, (78) show that so-called
&quot;spoiler candidates&quot; inject new issues into campaigns and bring new voters into
the political process (79) even without an instant runoff system. This reality casts doubt
on whether the &quot;spoiler problem&quot; is enough of a justification to change the
traditional electoral system. </font></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">C. The Economics of Instant Runoff Voting
</font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">1. Reducing Costs by Eliminating Traditional
Runoff Elections </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">There are currently twelve states, mostly in
the South, that are authorized to conduct runoff primary elections for state offices
instead of plurality- or majority-winner systems. (80) In these runoff states, each party
holds a primary election to determine its candidate. (81) If no candidate receives a
majority of the primary votes, the top two vote-getters compete in a runoff election to
determine who proceeds to the general election. (82) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting would eliminate the
need for traditional runoff elections in these states, (83) as well as in the many
municipalities that also hold traditional runoff elections. Theoretically, instant runoff
voting would cut election administration costs in half in those states, because only one
election would be held instead of two. To be sure, the administrative costs of conducting
an election are not small. San Francisco recently spent two million dollars on each
election under its traditional primary runoff system. (84) Alabama taxpayers paid three
million dollars to administer their runoff primaries in 2002, (85) and a statewide runoff
in North Carolina cost taxpayers nearly four million dollars in 1998. (86) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting would likely reduce
administrative costs in the ten states and various municipalities that currently utilize
traditional runoff elections. If instant runoff voting were adopted in these
jurisdictions, these states and municipalities would have to provide resources for only
one election instead of two. State and local governments could then use this savings to
make their voting systems more compatible with instant runoff voting by purchasing modern
voting machinery or providing voter education. The following discussion addresses whether
instant runoff voting would reduce campaign spending if, instead of concentrating on two
elections, candidates need focus only on one. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">2. The Cost of Campaigning </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Commentators have argued that if states with
traditional runoff elections adopt an instant runoff system, then a candidate's reliance
on wealthy contributors would decrease. (87) In addition, some have argued that instant
runoff voting would reduce the impact of special interest groups on candidates,
&quot;because [candidates would] only have to campaign and raise money for one election
rather than two.&quot; (88) Although it is clear that the occurrence of a traditional
runoff election &quot;sends candidates and their backers into a renewed frenzy of
fundraising,&quot; (89) it is unclear whether candidates in states with traditional runoff
elections spend more money campaigning than candidates in the states who use
plurality-winner primary systems. Plurality-winner primary systems often have contested
party primaries that cause candidates to spend heavily before the general election
campaign even begins. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Supporters of instant runoff voting believe
it could reduce the costs of political campaigning because logically, it would seem likely
to reduce negative campaigning, at least in closely contested political races. A candidate
who knows that he or she must rely on another candidate's supporters for his or her
second-, third-, or fourth-place votes is less likely to alienate these same supporters by
running negative attack advertisements. (90) Suppose that candidates D, R, G, and L are
running for governor. Pre-election polls show that D and R are the front-runners but that
G and L are each garnering support from almost ten percent of the electorate. In an
instant runoff system, supporters of G and L become important, because their second-place
votes will likely be counted as first-place votes once G and L have been eliminated. As
such, D and R will be hesitant to alienate supporters of G and L by barraging the air
waves with negative attack advertisements. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Despite the apparent logic of instant runoff
voting supporters, negative campaigning is unlikely to disappear regardless of which
voting system is employed. Even though most voters claim to dislike negative political
advertising, politicians use it because it is effective. (91) If D launched effective
negative attacks against R, many supporters of G and L would lower their ranking of R, not
D. Even if instant runoff voting would reduce negative campaigning, this does not
necessarily mean that campaign spending would be reduced. Less negative campaigning could
theoretically translate into more campaigning on substantive issues. Candidates could
merely reallocate their expenditures, not spend less. So, although instant runoff voting
may arguably improve the tone of closely contested elections, it will not necessarily
reduce the cost of campaigning. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">3. Expensive Voting Machinery </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">The feasibility of instant runoff voting
largely depends on the type of voting equipment employed. Newer technologies, such as
optical scanners and computer touch screens, can accommodate instant runoff voting with
little additional cost. (92) Older technologies, however, require an expensive and
time-consuming hand count. (93) Even instant runoff voting advocates admit &quot;it
doesn't make sense to adopt [instant runoff voting] until new equipment is
purchased.&quot; (94) Voting equipment that contains new technology is expensive, (95) and
counties have been hesitant to invest in it because of budgetary, administrative, and
security concerns. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In the 2000 elections, approximately
thirty-eight percent of counties nationwide used optical scan or electronic touch-screen
voting equipment that would have been compatible with instant runoff voting. (96) The
punch card system, made infamous by the 2000 Florida presidential recount, is incompatible
with instant runoff voting. In 2000, punch cards were used by approximately thirty-four
percent of counties, a figure that has remained steady for decades. (97) A punch card
system is easier for large counties to use than optical scanning because, with a punch
card system, voters need only a blank card, whereas with an optical scanning system, each
voter needs a separate ballot. In large counties, optically scanned ballots can be very
long and need to be printed in several languages. (98) The security of touch-screen
systems has also been questioned. (99 </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">These voting equipment and election
administration concerns make the implementation of instant runoff voting systems
infeasible for many jurisdictions in the near future. Similar concerns were key factors in
the defeat of instant runoff voting legislation in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991, in New
Mexico in 1998, and in Eugene, Oregon, in 2001. (100) Some municipalities that have been
successful in passing instant runoff voting legislation have made implementation
contingent upon the availability of modern vote-counting equipment. (101) Implementing
instant runoff voting at the state level may be a long way off in many places because of
these voting equipment concerns. Unless all counties within a state have modern equipment
capable of processing instant runoff voting at a reasonable cost, it would not be
practical to implement such a system at the state level. Until the administrative and
security concerns of modern optical scan and touch-screen systems are remedied, instant
runoff voting beyond the county level is unduly expensive and simply not feasible. </font></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">D. Voter Turnout </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting is seen by some as a
potential remedy to low voter participation. In general, &quot;[v]oter participation in
all elections has fallen to its lowest levels since the mass electorate was first
incorporated into the political system in the nineteenth century.&quot; (102) Turnout was
only forty-nine percent in the 1996 presidential election (103) and the turnout for
midterm congressional elections is even worse. Since the 1970s, voter participation in
midterm congressional elections has averaged thirty-seven percent. (104) This figure is
down from an average of nearly fifty percent during the 1960s. (105) Worse still is voter
participation in local elections, where turnout ranges from &quot;[ten to twenty] percent
for state and local elections concerning schools, safety, quality of services, and
taxes.&quot; (106) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">It is important to identify which eligible
voters are not participating in elections. Turnout has been particularly low among
nonpartisan, younger, and less educated voters. (107) As Thomas E. Patterson noted,
&quot;[a]s the electorate has shrunk, it has come to include proportionally more citizens
who are older, who have higher incomes, or who hold intense opinions....&quot; (108)
Although some view this decline in voter turnout as a sign of a relatively content
electorate,(109) most believe that this dwindling civic participation is a dangerous
phenomenon for democracy. (110) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">There are strong arguments that instant
runoff voting could lead to higher voter turnout. First, it might encourage participation
by those who support long-shot candidates by giving &quot;every voter incentive to
participate because your vote still counts even if your first choice candidate is
defeated.&quot; (111) Second, instant runoff voting could alleviate the potential
&quot;spoiler problem&quot; (112) and reduce the possibility that by voting for one's
favorite candidate, a voter might actually help to elect the candidate they like the
least. Currently, some voters choose to stay home rather than cast a vote that will
actually work against their intentions. (113) Instant runoff voting would encourage
participation from people who, in disproportionate numbers, are not voting now, (114) as
the &quot;spoiler problem&quot; may disproportionately affect younger citizens who are
more likely to vote for a third party candidate. (115) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Australia and Malta, two countries who use
preference voting systems in which voters rank candidates in single member districts,
(116) had more than ninety-five percent voter turnout in 1996--the highest voter turnout
in the world that year. (117) Although it is clear that places that use preference voting
systems have high levels of voter turnout, it is not clear that preference voting is a
significant cause of this high voter turnout or that the lack of such a system is a reason
for low turnout in the Unites States. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">In fact, the reasons for declining voter
participation in the United States go well beyond the frustration that supporters of
long-shot candidates may feel and the potential &quot;spoiler problem.&quot; Political
scientists have offered a myriad of reasons for declining voter participation in the
United States. (118) Most agree that the root of declining voter participation in the
United States is electoral reforms made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries that weakened political parties and decreased political competition in many
regions of the country. (119) Taking resources away from the political parties in effect
increased &quot;the costs of political participation&quot; for voters, while dwindling
political competition removed &quot;the pressure for parties to maintain a highly active
electorate.&quot; (120) Indeed, data suggests that voter turnout declines when political
parties get weaker. Weakening parties, as shown by declining party organization, (121)
have correlated with declining turnout in the United States and other democracies. (122)
This correlation also holds true in state comparisons. The states that have experienced
the largest turnout declines are the ones &quot;that once had strong traditional party
organizations, which placed a high priority on getting out the vote and devoted
substantial human resources to doing so.&quot; (123) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Political parties were weakened by many
Progressive-era reforms that limited party control over elections. (124) These reforms
included ballot changes that made voters choose between individual candidates rather than
a political party's slate of candidates. (125) Moreover, the development of direct
primaries, campaign finance reform, (126) initiatives, referenda, and recalls all helped
to take power away from political parties and reduce their effectiveness at getting out
the vote. (127) Such reforms increased the costs of elections, subsequently causing states
to lengthen terms for political offices, thus creating more time between elections. (128)
As a result, &quot;Americans were [no longer] continually involved&quot; in the political
process. (129) Without the &quot;team&quot; feeling and mobilization efforts of strong
political parties, turnout decreased dramatically. (130) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Decreasing political competition between the
two major political parties is another important factor that has resulted in lower voter
turnout. As one author noted, &quot;[w]ith the Republicans controlling most of the North
and the Democrats the South, the early twentieth century experienced few closely fought
elections. As competition waned, much of the vitality drained out of the electoral
system.&quot; (131) Today, the areas of geographic partisan control have changed, but the
story is much the same. Currently, the number of &quot;safe&quot; seats for both parties
in Congress far exceeds the number of contested seats. (132) In these states and
districts, parties, and voters themselves, have little incentive to get out the vote. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">The only thing clear about declining voter
turnout is that there is no easy way to remedy the situation. Efforts to ease voter
registration and absentee voting in recent years have not resulted in the corresponding
increase in participation that was anticipated. (133) Thus, it is unclear how an instant
runoff voting system would affect the power of political parties, the competitiveness of
electoral districts, or voter turnout. Indeed, an instant runoff voting system might
actually decrease voter participation by further diminishing the power of political
parties. (134) Illustrative of this point is the fact that third parties in many states
and districts have advocated instant runoff voting, presumably because they believe that
it will help their party at the expense of the two major parties. In addition, instant
runoff voting cannot, by itself, change &quot;safe&quot; seats into competitive ones.
(135) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Instant runoff voting could be effective at
increasing voter turnout in traditional primary runoff elections. There is generally a
drastic decrease in voter turnout from the first election to the second in states holding
traditional runoffs. (136) Instant runoff voting would ensure that &quot;the decisive
election occurs when turnout is highest.&quot; (137) For example, in Georgia's 1992 race
for the U.S. Senate, turnout for the December runoff election was half that of the
November general election. (138) Instant runoff voting would arguably prevent this
decrease by eliminating the second election, hence the problem of supporters of eliminated
candidates not bothering to show up for the runoff election would no longer exist. It
remains unclear, however, whether an instant runoff voting system would actually remedy
the problem of low voter turnout in the first primary election or in the general election.

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">IV. POTENTIAL SIDE-EFFECTS OF INSTANT
RUNOFF VOTING </font></strong></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A. Voter Confusion </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">A common claim of instant runoff voting
opponents is that the process is too complicated and will confuse voters. (139) In
contrast, supporters claim that instant runoff voting is &quot;as easy as 1-2-3&quot; and
that all voters need do is rank the candidates. (140) If for no other reason than its
unfamiliarity, it seems obvious that instant runoff voting would not be as easy for most
voters to understand as the traditional majority- or plurality-winner systems used in
virtually all elections in the United States. (141) In addition, instant runoff voting
would make the job of election administrators more difficult. (142) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Ballots are already complicated. The
confusion over the &quot;butterfly ballot&quot; in Florida during the 2000 presidential
election is evidence that voters can easily be confused by changes to voting methods.
(143) Washington's Secretary of State opposes instant runoff voting because it would
complicate a system in which voters are already &quot;overwhelmed by a huge number of
choices in some elections [sic] cycles.&quot; (144) It is also complicated to explain to
voters how the winner is chosen, meaning that voters would inevitably attempt to
strategically rank, or choose not to rank, candidates. (145) In addition, public
confidence in the current electoral system would be reduced further if many voters did not
understand how to vote, how their votes were counted, or felt as if the strategic voting
of other citizens had somehow undermined their vote. It is quite likely that &quot;the
average voter ... is apt to be skeptical of mathematically complicated methods designed to
overcome Condorcet paradoxes and other arcane maladies that may afflict the best of
democratic aspirations.&quot; (146) Traditional runoff elections may be preferable to
instant runoff elections, as they result in true majoritarianism &quot;without resorting
to convoluted procedures that--however more virtuous they may be--might baffle and
alienate voters.&quot; (147) </font></p>

<p><em><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">B. Security and Unintended Consequences
(148) </font></em></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Even supporters of instant runoff voting
admit that counting ballots in such a system is more complicated than in a traditional
plurality- or majority-winner system. (149) Opponents of instant runoff voting believe it
is not merely complicated, but a &quot;deceptive and potentially dangerous&quot; system.
(150) Further support for this argument is that the complicated counting scheme involved
in instant runoff voting can result in unintended consequences, &quot;because ranking a
candidate higher can actually cause the candidate to lose, and ranking a candidate lower
can cause the candidate to win.&quot; (151) In addition, it is possible for a candidate to
lose even if he or she is preferred over each of the other candidates by a majority of the
voters. (152) Instant runoff voting, therefore, may not always function as intended. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Beyond strategic voting and complicated vote
counting scenarios, a potential security problem also exists with the use of instant
runoff voting. Because an instant runoff voting system requires newer voting technologies
to be cost-effective, (153) it could be more susceptible to vote tampering. Specifically,
recent studies and tests have shown that touch-screen voting technology is insecure and
error-prone. (154) A Massachusetts Institute of Technology/California Institute of
Technology study of touch-screen voting during the 1998 and 2000 Senate elections showed
that 8.2% of touch-screen votes were lost. This was greater than all other methods, except
for the now rarely used punch card lever machine. (155) After the 2004 election, the
Election Verification Project investigated nearly nine hundred reports of touch-screen
voting irregularities and found that &quot;[e]lectronic voting machines lost votes in
North Carolina, miscounted votes in Ohio, and broke down in New Orleans.&quot; (156) The
most frequent criticism of touch-screen voting machines is that most do not produce a
paper record of votes cast, (157) making manual recounting and verification impossible.
But even a paper record would not alleviate problems that cannot be seen, such as software
errors or outright tampering. &quot;[S]omeone [c]ould program a machine to give a wrong
answer.... If that were to happen, the machine would still work fine--we just wouldn't
know it [was recording the wrong answer].&quot; (158) Clearly, a potential security breach
could cause havoc by creating indefiniteness regarding who has been elected or by allowing
foreigners to dictate who wins U.S. elections. These potential pitfalls need to be avoided
and consequently it is too early to implement a voting system that requires these
potentially unreliable technologies. </font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">CONCLUSION </font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">Elected officials should refrain from passing
instant runoff voting legislation. Despite its theoretical promise to improve elections,
instant runoff voting is a potentially illegal reform with unclear benefits, probable
negative side effects, and possible unintended consequences. Courts and administrative
officials will likely determine that instant runoff voting is inconsistent with election
laws in the many states that require majority winners. Additionally, instant runoff voting
statutes may violate state constitutions that require the election winner to be the
candidate who receives the most votes. Even if instant runoff voting can clear these legal
hurdles, it is not at all clear that it will be able to provide the unambiguous mandates,
cheaper elections, and increased voter turnout that its supporters claim. Instead, instant
runoff voting will likely result in confusion, uncertainty, and instability, making
&quot;the cure [likely] worse than the disease.&quot; (159) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">(46.) Some critics also claim that instant

citizen have an equally weighted vote. See Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104-05 (2000).
Arguably, instant runoff voting would allow some voters to have their ballot
&quot;counted&quot; multiple times in one election--allowing their votes to be valued more
than others. See Bringing Choice Back into Politics: Alaska Ballot Initiative for Instant
Run-Off Voting, at http://www.ballot.org/resources/irv.html (Aug. 20, 2002) (citing the

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">(56.) This Note does not analyze the relative
merits and disadvantages of majority or plurality rule in single member districts versus a
plurality representation system. Instant runoff voting, as it is currently being proposed
in state legislatures, would fit into the majority or plurality rule in the single member
districts system that is currently the norm across the United States. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua">(148.) Some of the concern over confusion,
see supra Part IV.A, and unintended consequences might be overblown, as there are several
nations that currently use some version of ranked voting similar to instant runoff voting.
Ireland, to elect its president, and Malta, to elect its national legislature, use the
single transferable vote system and Australia uses the alternative vote to elect the upper
house of its legislature. See ANDREW REEVE &amp; ALAN WARE, ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: A
COMPARATIVE AND THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION 44 (1992). See generally id. at 149-51
(describing the single transferable vote and alternative vote systems). Nevertheless, all
electoral systems possess negative aspects that must be acknowledged and assessed before
implementation. There are no municipalities in the United States with a tradition of
instant runoff voting except for Cambridge, Massachusetts. See Press Release, Center for
Voting &amp; Democracy, Ranked Ballets in the United States: Proven Electoral Reform
Gaining Support (Nov. 6, 2001), available at http://www.fairvote.org/irv/nov0601.htm.
Cambridge, however, uses instant runoff voting in a proportional representation system.
Id. Therefore, the Cambridge example offers little assistance for determining the
workability of instant runoff voting in a plurality-winner, single-member district system.
