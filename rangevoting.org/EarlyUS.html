The abstract of
Professor <a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/nageljh.html">Jack H. Nagel's</a>
paper <i>The Burr Dilemma in Approval Voting</i>,
Journal of Politics 69,1 (February 2007) 43-58]
said
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Quote from Nagel's abstract:</b>
It has not previously been recognized that the first four presidential elections
(1788-1800) were <i>conducted using a variant of approval voting</i>. That experiment
ended disastrously in 1800 with the infamous Electoral College tie between
Jefferson and Burr.  [After that, the 12th amendment then changed 
the presidential election system.]
<!-- The tie, ..., resulted less from miscalculation than from a
strategic tension built into approval voting, which forces two leaders appealing
to the same voters to play a game of Chicken.
Because the <a href="BurrSummary.html">Burr Dilemma</a> poses
a significant difficulty for approval voting, this paper urges that
researchers give more attention to "instant runoff" reform options,
especially [IRV] and the Coombs rule. -->
</blockquote>
<!-- <p>
Actually, Burr's dilemma did not result in any pathology in 1800, in the sense that
the two "clones" Burr and Jefferson did <i>not</i> enter into a retaliatory spiral 
causing them both to lose &ndash; they actually both won.
But Burr's dilemma plausibly would genuinely have resulted in a pathology in
<a href="FunnyElections.html#port86">Portugal 1986</a>.
Therefore, "vote splitting" effects <i>can</i> still occur in approval
voting &ndash; contrary to some advertising.
</p>
-->

<p>
But the early USA  was not <i>precisely</i> using
"<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>" 
because there was a 2-vote 
limit (genuine approval voting
has no limit on the number of approved candidates).
This 2-vote limit would have made almost no difference if 
almost all electors would not have wanted
to approve more than 2 candidates anyway.  In such cases it was <i>effectively</i>
the same thing as approval voting.  That was probably true in 1788, 1792, and 1800 &ndash;
i.e. these three elections <i>were</i> effectively approval voting &ndash; but
is more dubious in 1796 because in that one there were 13 candidates so quite
possibly a decent number of electors would have wanted to approve more than two if permitted.
</p>

<p>
Also, in another (unwise) twist, the rules said
the 2nd place finisher became Vice President as a "consolation prize," which may have
slightly altered some voters' calculations.  (Note: this was <i>not</i> the same
thing as some fairly common elections we have now 
where voters can vote for N candidates and the top N win
the N available equal seats, because the two seats here were highly <i>un</i>equal.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway &ndash; what <i>did</i> happen in the first four (1788-1800) US presidential elections?
</p>

<p><b>1788-9:</b>
Washington first with 69, Adams second with 34; 12 candidates but all
the others got &le;9 and plainly had no chance.
</p>
<p><b>1792:</b>
5 candidates, Washington wins with 132, Adams 2nd with 77, Clinton 3rd with 50, rest &le;4 each
[popular vote used in only 1 state &ndash; VA]
</p>
<p><b>1796:</b>
13 candidates, Adams wins with 71, Jefferson 2nd with 68, Pinckney 3rd with 59,
Burr 4th with 30, ... 6th was Ellsworth with 11, all others 7 or below .
Adams &amp; Jefferson hated each other but became President &amp; VP.
The fact that the "runner-up becomes VP" system 
permitted P &amp; VP to be two people who 
hated one another, was a major reason this system was discarded.  
But we do not feel that
<i>approval voting</i> was a mistake.  We feel the 2nd-place=VP rule was the mistake.  The
right fix would have been to use approval voting to vote for pre-agreed running-mate teams.
</p><p>
The worse fix that they actually adopted with the 12th amendment,
was to have the electors use <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting to vote for the president, and a <i>separate</i> 
plurality election
to vote for the vice president 
(with the additional twist that electors are sometimes not permitted
to vote for somebody if it was a co-habitant of his own state!?!).
Actually it is not "plurality" it is "majority" in the sense that if a majority does not 
happen then the congress steps in to "break the tie" (which actually need not be a "tie,"
merely a non-majority win).
The election then is first sent to the House, which must choose one of the top three. 
That voting is complex, it is by state, not by representative, each state gets one vote (at most),
and the consent of an <i>absolute majority of states</i> is required to complete.
This incidentally has the disadvantage that it might never happen.
The Vice-Presidential election requires an absolute majority of electors similarly, 
and if it fails, it goes to the Senate. An absolute majority of the whole 
number of senators is, again, a requirement. 
</p><p>
Note that all this <i>still</i> 
permits the P &amp; VP to hate one another, although it 
became less likely.  
The <a href="USconstitution.txt">constitution</a>
never said (including all amendments
up to the present day) anything about either "political
parties" or "running mates" (acted as though these two 
concepts did not exist) although
as time went by political parties did develop, eventually dominating the scene,
and eventually they always ran two "running mates" for P &amp; VP, although
occasionally running <i>different</i> 2-mate pairs in different states
or in different parties in cases where one man was running for president
with the backing of more than one party.  [That might create difficulties,
but so far has not.  For <a href="Fusion.html">example</a>
in 1896 W.J.Bryan ran with running mate Arthur Sewell (D) <i>and</i> also
with running mate Thomas E. Watson (P).
If Bryan had won the presidency instead of coming in 2nd behind McKinley, then 
it would not have been obvious whom the vice president would then be &ndash;
Sewell, Watson, or Hobart? &ndash; and indeed quite probably then would have been decided
by congress not the electoral college.]
Also we ended up with two kinds of voting &ndash;
popular vote within states for president
and VP, versus the Electoral Collegians 
voting for president and VP.  The latter was
originally far more important but now is almost of no importance.
All this happened because of tradition and state laws, <i>not</i> the US constitution,
which actually by itself in the 12th amendment is quite atrocious on this topic; if the
12th amendment, and it alone, were the law of the land that would be a disaster.
</p>
<p><b>1800:</b>
5 candidates, Jefferson wins with 73 after tiebreak with Burr (also 73).
Burr actually encouraged the congress in tiebreak to vote Jefferson saying
he did not want the presidency, although apparently if he had wanted it, he
probably would have had more support than Jefferson and would have won!
This election also featured (which was an outrage)
Jefferson as the one counting congress's votes and thus electing himself!
