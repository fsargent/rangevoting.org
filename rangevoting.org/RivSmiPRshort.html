<b>The question:</b> can we <i>both</i> prevent fraud <i>and</i> prevent vote-buying &amp; coercion
&ndash;  having cake and eating it too?
</p>

<h3> 1987-2007: The cryptographers find out how </h3>
<p>
The net answer from a community
of about 20 cryptography and computational-complexity experts from 
several countries over the last 20 years is
<i>yes</i>.
<i>But</i>
only with complicated cryptography algorithms, and with
each voter needing a personal <i>trusted</i> "digital assistant" in order to be able to
cast a vote.  So: dubious political &amp; technical realism.
</p>
<p><small>
One of the best such schemes is the "homomorphic encryption"
approach advocated by <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/">Berry Schoenmakers</a> 
at TU Eindhoven (Netherlands).
</small></p>

<h3> 2007: Breakthrough: Secure, Private, Verifiable, Simple, Low-tech voting </h3>
<p>
Rivest &amp; Smith found a way to have it all.
Their new voting protocols are almost obvious in retrospect;
they could have been discovered 100 years ago and are incredibly simple &ndash; explainable
to children.  They don't need computers and don't need cryptography.
</p>
<p>
<b>Even better,</b> the Rivest-Smith security protocols
can handle a <b>wide variety of vote-totaling systems.</b>
<small>
The US public is most familiar with <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> voting
where your vote is "name one candidate then shut up."  (Most-named candidate wins.)
Unfortunately this is a poor system:
<ol>
<li>
The candidate regarded as <i>worst</i> by a huge majority of voters
can <a href="LoseAll.html">easily</a> 
win the election;
</li><li>
Voting for your favorite candidate can be a huge
strategic <a href="MistakeMe.html">mistake</a>;
</li><li>
Plurality voters express the <i>least</i> amount of information
they possibly could in their vote, defeating the purpose 
of voting as an information-gathering process;
</li><li>
Over time plurality voting countries <a href="Duverger.html">evolve</a> into 
<a href="Strangle.html">two-party domination</a> so that voters have minimum choice,
defeating the whole goal of democracy.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
But political scientists have known for over 200 years that
better vote-totaling systems exist.  One of the simplest is
<a href="Approval.html">Approval voting</a> where your vote is "mark <i>all</i> the candidates
you 'approve'."  (Most-approved wins.)  This actually is <a href="JKBB.html">simpler</a> 
than plurality voting because there is no special rule against "overvoting."
(Little-known fact:
the USA's <a href="EarlyUS.html">first four</a> presidential
elections employed a variant of approval voting.  The 
<a href="SovietApp.html">Soviets</a> also tried it.)
Probably the <a href="UniqBest.html">best</a>
simple voting system &ndash; cf. the <a href="OlympCover.html">Olympics</a> &ndash;
is  <a href="SmithWM.html">Range Voting</a> where your vote is "provide a score
for every candidate on a fixed scale (e.g. 0-to-9)." (Highest average score wins.)
In this system, voting 9 for your honest favorite is <i>never</I> a strategic mistake,
so voters provide <i>more-honest</i> information, and they also provide far <i>more</i>
information.
</p><P>
More information + more honest information = better election winners = better world.

<h3> R&amp;S's three protocols &ndash; ThreeBallot, VAV, and Twin &ndash; <font color="red">what they are and how they work</font> </h3>

<p>
Rivest &amp; Smith's
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/tb8.pdf">paper</a> 
introduces three different antifraud
voting protocols: "ThreeBallot", "VAV," and "Twin."
(At <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/evt07/cfp/">EVT 07 conference</a>,
Sheraton in Boston, evening of 6 August 2007.)
</p>

<p>
<b>VAV</b> (<i>v</i>ote-<i>a</i>ntivote-<i>v</i>ote):
<ol>
<li>
Each voter casts <i>three</i> ballots: a <i>vote</i>, an <i>antivote</i>, and a second 
<i>vote</i>.  For example, to vote for Bush, a voter could vote for both Bush and Gore,
while also antivoting for Gore.  (The antivote must be the same as one
of her votes, and cancels it.  Ballot triples disobeying this property are immediately rejected.)
</li>
<li>
The voter than takes home, as her <i>receipt</i>, a copy of <i>one</i> of the these three
ballots.  It is crucial that the <i>voter  chooses</i> which one to copy and take home,
and that her choice is <i>secret</i> &ndash; a government machine gives her
the chosen signed certified receipt but <i>does not remember</i> it.
</li>
<li>
Finally, the government posts
all the ballots &ndash; 3N in all, if there are N voters &ndash; 
on a <i>Public Bulletin Board</i> on the
internet, along with a list of the voters' names and addresses
(but not saying which voters cast which votes).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
What is so good about this?
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Any voter can <i>check</i> that the vote recorded on her official receipt number 576388321
is on that bulletin board (by looking up 576388321).  If it is absent or disagrees, she
has official certified proof that there was election fraud.  (The other two parts of
her vote are posted with <i>other</i> ID numbers on the bulletin board, and the voter
cannot prove to anybody what her other two numbers are, since she has no receipts for them.)
</li>
<li>
Anybody can <i>total</i> the votes (since all are posted publicly) to verify the right winner won.
</li>
<li>
If anybody corruptly <i>deletes</i> or <i>alters</i> a lot of
ballots, then (since nobody knows which third of the 
ballots are copied) they will with overwhelming probability delete/alter a lot of ballots
that have receipts. So the fraud will be immediately visible.
</li>
<li>
If anybody corruptly <i>adds</i> a lot of
ballots, then there will be more than 3N.
So the fraud will be immediately visible.
</li>
<li>
If anybody corruptly <i>adds</i> a lot of
fake voters too, then some fraction of the published  voter name-address pairs
will be fake.  (If trying for a 1% fraud, then 1% will be fake.)  This is easily checked
by, e.g, reporters who will find one fake voter per 100 random people they check.
Note that detecting this kind of <i>nationwide</i> fraud is thus within the reach of
a <i>single</i> checker. 
</li>
<li>
If anybody tries to <i>buy</i> (or coerce) your vote for (say) Gore,
then you can show them your Gore-receipt and ask for your money, while still
<i>actually</i> voting for Bush (or for anybody else).  The receipt has absolutely no
relation to how you really voted.  (Anybody willing to pay for
that "proof" is very easily parted
from their money...)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>ThreeBallot</b> is related to VAV and designed to be even simpler <i>if</i> voters
are using <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> 
or <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.  To "approve" Clinton
a voter approves
him twice and disapproves him once; to "disapprove" Bush you disapprove twice and 
approve once.  This also permits "write-in" candidates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Too complicated?</b> 
We can just give voters who find this too complicated the <i>option</i>
of voting in the old-fashioned "OneBallot" style.  
(Total number of ballots cast is 3A+B where A is number of ThreeBallot voters and B
is number of old-style voters.)
Upon mixing in the OneBallots with the ThreeBallot ballots in the same box,
the OneBallots &ndash; almost magically &ndash; become <i>protected</i> against fraud
because fraudsters do not know which are the protected ThreeBallots and which are the
fraudable OneBallots, so they can't afford to alter either.
This "mix-in compatibility" property allows "easy upgrade" from insecure to secure voting.
</p>

<p>
<b>Twin</b> is
the simplest of Rivest &amp; Smith's  schemes.
With Twin, voters do not need to make <i>three</i> ballots to
vote once &ndash; they only need to make <i>one</i> and drop it in a ballot box as usual.
Each voter after the initial 10 gets as a take-home receipt, a <i>copy</i> of
a randomly chosen ballot in the box that was cast by a <i>previous</i> voter.
Then all ballots are posted on a public bulletin board as usual.
</P>
<p><small>
(An elegant "circular"
twist suggested by <a href="http://home.gwu.edu/~poste/">Stefan Popoveniuc</a>
is that the first 10 voters must be <i>election workers</i>, and at 
the <i>end</i> of the day,
after the last voter, they each get a take-home receipt too, again a copy of a random ballot
in the box. That way everybody gets exactly one receipt.)
</small></p>
</p>
<p>
The security properties of Twin are the same as VAV, except that voters now check
<i>somebody else's</i> receipt (which is also the reason that the receipt has absolutely no
relation to <i>your</i> vote and hence is not useful for a vote-buyer or coercer).
</p>
<h3> Machines </h3>
<p>
In all three schemes, certain simple machines 
are needed at polling places
that <i>check</i> that the voter is submitting a valid (rule-obeying) vote,
that make receipt-copies, and/or that randomly sample from a box of ballots.
The tasks these machines perform are, however, simple and
performable <i>without</i> computers, purely <i>mechanically</i>.
(Mechanical no-computer adders, copiers, and random lottery-sampling machines all have
been widely manufactured and used in the past.)
It is important that these machines be simple and transparent in their operation, so
everybody can plainly see they are doing what they are supposed to;
and we also want it to be plain they do <i>not</i> contain
a computer or sophisticated electronics, because 
then the machines could "cheat."
For example they could "remember" which of the three VAV
ballots the voters chose to copy 
and which not; a
fraudster armed with that information could then safely alter the uncopied ballots.
(For the same reason, it is important that no spy devices such as cameras are allowed in
the voting booth.)
</p>
<p>
It is interesting that Rivest &amp; Smith's work actually indicates that computers are <i>bad</i>
for security.  However, it is OK to use computers in all stages of the process <i>after</i>
the voters have had their ballots validity-checked and they've gotten their take-home receipts,
because any hacking or cheating by the computers would then be detectable.
</p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

<p>
These are very simple schemes which solve a problem open for over 100 years.
Subject to certain
assumptions about what the checking machines do, etc, they can be proven to
make fraud detectable, allow each voter to <i>verify</i> her vote
was counted correctly (unlike now where that is purely a matter of trust),
keep votes private, and make vote-buying and coercion impossible.

<h3> About the inventors </h3>

<p>
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/">Ronald L. Rivest</a>
is most famous for being the "R" in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">RSA cryptosystem</a>.
This was the first practicible "public key" cryptosystem in which you can <i>publish</i>
the method of writing secret messages to you, and even an eavesdropper who knows the entire
encrypted message, and has full knowledge of the encryption procedure, still cannot
feasibly decrypt the message (but you can).
This 1977 invention revolutionized cryptography and later became an essential ingredient in
all cryptographic secure-voting schemes.
In 2002, Rivest was awarded the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing Award</a>, the highest
award in computer science, for RSA.
He is a professor at <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>.
</p><P>
<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">Warren D. Smith</a>
got his PhD in Applied Math from Princeton in 1988 and worked in a variety
of research jobs including at AT&amp;T Bell Labs
and NEC Research Institute  (both now defunct).
Smith is the  developer of 
cryptographic voting protocols that
hold the
current records for security properties, and he's also performed the most
computer simulation comparisons of vote-totaling methods.
In 2005 he, with Colorado Electrical Engineer <a href="voldir/Directory.html">Jan Kok</a>, founded
the
<a href="">Center for Range Voting, </a>.
