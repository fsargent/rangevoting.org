<H2> A Paper Trail for Voting Machines </H2>

PARANOIA over electronic voting is the new American consensus. The
Democrats who will vote in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday aren't
worried that Hillary Clinton will steal the election from Barack Obama
or John Edwards, but a good chunk of them would probably confess to
dark fears about a Republican plot in November, even if Karl Rove
won't be involved.
</p><p>
Last month, Colorado's secretary of state, Mike Coffman, a Republican,
decertified the state's electronic voting machines, after the alarming
finding that one model could be disabled with a magnet and others were
scandalously inaccurate. He left voters to draw their own conclusions
about what this meant for the state's most recent elections. The
California secretary of state, Debra Bowen, a Democrat, took office
last year after running on a don't-trust-electronic-voting platform,
and in August she pulled the plug on the state's voting machines.
</p><p>
But what other options are there? Paper ballots aren't perfect. Ballot
boxes can be stuffed or lost. Indeed, because of Florida's
paper-ballot mess in 2000, electronic voting is probably here to stay.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is an elegant solution that lets us use modern
technology while assuaging the growing fears about voter fraud. Ronald
L. Rivest, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist,
and Warren D. Smith, a mathematician and voting reform advocate, have
<a href="RivSmiPRshort.html">proposed</a>
an ingenious method that would combine paper ballots and a
Web site to achieve greater ballot security than is possible with
paper or software alone.
</p><p>
Their basic idea is to allow each voter to take home a photocopy of a
randomly selected ballot cast by someone else.
</p><p>
The scheme is low-tech. Paper ballots would be tallied by optical
scanners or even by hand. The results would be then posted on a Web
site. Using a serial number assigned to each ballot, voters could
check the site to make sure that their random ballots were posted and
had not been altered or misread.
</p><p>
To discourage vote buying, voters would not receive copies of their
own ballots. My receipt would be someone else's ballot, so I would
have no way of proving to a bribe-wielding politician whom I voted
for. (There are no voter names on secret ballots, of course, so the
random receipts would not compromise the privacy of the voting booth.)
</p><p>
Yet another opportunity for fraud, perhaps more likely than outright
vote buying, would be created if voters were given paper records of
their own ballots. Many voters would ditch their receipts in the first
trash can they see. Then, crooked election workers could retrieve the
discarded receipts and change the corresponding electronic votes,
confident that there would be no evidence of their fraud.
</p><p>
But under the system proposed by Professor Rivest and Dr. Smith,
should corrupt poll workers "forget" to count some ballots, people
would notice and complain. And because the receipts are copies of
ballots chosen at random each time, a few ballots would be copied
twice or more. Finding a discarded receipt would not guarantee that it
is "safe" to change the corresponding vote 
&ndash;
there might be other
copies of the same ballot floating around, and some watchful citizen
might be checking them.
</p><p>
The Web site would also publish the names of everyone who voted. This
would prevent someone from undetectably adding fake votes from names
copied off, say, tombstones.
</p><p>
Perhaps best of all, because a public Web site would post the complete
information from every ballot, anyone could check that every single
vote has been counted accurately.
</p><p>
Too much trouble, you say? Don't bother, then. All that matters is
that some concerned citizens check. The news media, the political
parties, activists and bloggers would be checking so that the rest of
us don't have to. Indeed, Professor Rivest and Dr. Smith demonstrate
mathematically that it takes only a tiny number of people checking the
Web site to catch any substantial fraud with near certainty. For
instance, to have 95 percent assurance of detecting a fraud involving
6 percent of ballots, only 50 voters would have to check, and this is
true no matter how large the electorate. If the margin of victory is
less than 6 percent, then more people would surely check.
</p><p>
The virtue of the system is its simplicity. The only technology that
would be required is a Web site and a scanning printer that could
produce a copy of a random ballot for each voter at the press of a
button. That wouldn't be hard to devise.
</p><p>
As YouTube demonstrates, the Internet is a leveling force, allowing
people to assume roles formerly left to professionals. The
Rivest-Smith scheme would make ensuring fair elections everyone's
business.
