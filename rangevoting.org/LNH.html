<H2> "Later no harm" &ndash; an actually-silly (&amp; massively overhyped by "FairVote")
 voting system criterion </H2>

<p>
In July 2011, FairVote posted a <a href="FairVoteLNHnonsense.html">webpage</a>
that began
</p><blockquote>
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a> voting 
is a method of voting to elect single winners that has adherents among some voting theorists, 
but is unworkable in contested elections in which voters have a stake in the outcome.
Once aware of how approval voting works, strategic voters will always earn a 
significant advantage over less informed voters. This problem with strategic voting 
far outweighs any other factor when evaluating the potential use of approval voting in 
governmental elections. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other methods that should not be used in meaningfully contested elections include range voting, 
score voting, the Borda Count and Bucklin voting. They all share approval voting's practical 
flaw of not allowing voters to support a second choice without potentially causing the 
defeat of their first choice. Such voting methods have their potential value, 
but only in elections where voters have no particular stake in the outcome. 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only voting methods that should be weighed seriously for governmental elections are
methods that do not violate this "later-no-harm" criterion (plurality voting and forms of 
runoff elections and <a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff</a>
voting) or only do so indirectly (such as Condorcet 
voting methods).
</blockquote>
<p>
and then it got worse from there.  
Well, first of all, what <i>is</i> this "later-no-harm" criterion that they consider 
to be so crucial and 
incredibly pre-eminent among voting system <a href="CompChart.html">criteria</a>?
Well, FairVote's page (and also their many-page-long so-called "analysis" it cited)
did not actually formally define it (!!), but since we're trying to 
be better than them,  we actually shall:
</p><blockquote>
<b>The Later-No-Harm criterion (LNH):</b>
In a voting method based on rank-order ballots (i.e. each ballot is a ranking of the candidates 
in order from most to least liked), a voter, by honestly stating her second-choice candidate,
should never be able to "harm" the candidate she wrote as her top preference.
Here "harm" means "cause to lose (or prevent from outright winning) the election."
<br> 
<small>
[Warning: This wording by me has intentionally been based on FairVote's.  
But an actual published paper
by Douglas R. Woodall (1994)
<a href="WoodallP5.html">Properties of Preferential Election Rules</a>
defining over 30 voting system criteria, many new,
stated the somewhat stronger and different definition
"Adding a later preference to a rank-order ballot should not harm any candidate already listed,"
which was repeated in Woodall's 1997 <a href="Woodall97.pdf">paper</a> in Discrete Applied Maths.
But Woodall felt it necessary to note
that a referee had described LNH as "unpalatable" and that Michael Dummett
had called it  "quite unreasonable." 
LNH and "House monotonicity" were the only criteria Woodall felt it necessary to attach 
such a health and safety warning to.
Also, Woodall 1997's theorem 2 proved no Condorcet method
could obey LNH, which contradicts the assertion by FairVote that it does so "indirectly" 
&ndash; whatever that was supposed to mean.]
</small>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But what about voting methods whose ballots are <i>not</i> rank-orderings?  
For example, with <a href="https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.thml">score</a> voting, each ballot gives a numerical 
score on some fixed scale (say from 0 to 9) to each candidate 
(greater scores for better candidates).  Presumably, LNH then would mean "by honestly scoring
somebody with the second highest score used on that ballot, a voter should be unable to
harm the candidate she gave her greatest score to."  Unfortunately it then would remain
unclear just what LNH should mean if, say, she scored more than one candidate co-equal top.
Should doing so be unable to "harm" any of them?  FairVote never said, and as we've said they
did not even try to define LNH.  And this equality issue gets rather relevant with
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting, because it is just score voting where
the <i>only</i> permitted scores are 0 and 1 ("disapprove" and "approve").
Obviously, an approval voter in an election with &ge;3 candidates is <i>forced</i> to 
treat some as equal (which is a disadvantage of approval versus score voting).
</blockquote><p>
And with <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting
(unfortunately the most-used voting method in the world at present) your ballot 
is "name one candidate, then shut up" so it is <i>impossible</i> for a voter 
even to <i>state</i> her "second choice"... except actually it <i>is</i> possible,
but if you try, then your ballot is discarded as "spoiled."
FairVote therefore (quote above) considers
Plurality to satisfy LNH, but obviously it really does not, because: 
if your plurality-vote for X caused X to win,
but then you indicated a second choice Y, that would cause your ballot to be 
discarded, which would "harm" X by causing him no longer to be an outright winner.
</p><p>
So now that we have at least some idea what LNH is: which voting methods obey or disobey it?
FairVote is correct that Instant Runoff (IRV) obeys LNH and that score and Borda disobey LNH.
</p><p>
What about approval voting?  That's debatable.  A voter by approving several candidates, thus
regarding them as "equal," can only "harm" approved-candidate X, by "helping" (i.e. electing)
also-approved candidate Y &ndash;
which is fine with that voter if X and Y were truly equal in her view!
Of course in reality, most voters do <i>not</i> really regard candidates X and Y as equal; they 
simply were forced by the rules of approval voting to pretend they were equal.
And a voter who honestly prefers X over Y, can by approving both X and Y, harm X!
She could avoid that harm by disapproving Y, but in that case she could still be 
in trouble, because then she might be (say) disapproving both Y and Z
(and she hates Z), and
she by the foolish act of disapproving Y, might cause Z to win!  So with approval 
voting in a &ge;3-candidate election, every ballot must take such risks.  They are unavoidable.
If you approve too many candidates you risk electing one of the worse among them.
If, on the other hand, you <i>dis</i>approve 
too many candidates, you risk electing one of the worse among <i>them</i>.
</p><p>
A good compromise, which tends to minimize such risks, is "approve
all the candidates you consider better than the expected value of the winner."
You of course do not know who the winner will be, ahead of time &ndash; you can only make
probabilistic <i>guesses</i> about everybody's winning chances &ndash;
which is why I am using the word "expected."  Any approval-voter who follows this strategy will
never help anybody to win whose quality is below expectation; and never will harm
anybody whose quality (in her judgment) lies above expectation.  Therefore, by voting
in this way, her vote will <i>always</i> increase the expected quality (as reckoned by her)
of the winner (versus if she had not voted at all).
</p><p>
Similarly, with score voting, a voter by using the approval-voting strategy we just 
described (i.e. give the maximum-allowed score to each candidate you consider above 
expectation, and the minimum-allowed score to each candidate you consider below expectation) can
guarantee that her vote will increase the expected value of the winner. Further,
with score voting, by casting an honestly-ordered vote, you <i>never</i> can
cause a worse election result than you would have gotten by not voting at all.
</p><p>
Those desirable properties, sadly, are not enjoyed by IRV.
More precisely, a voter, by voting
her honest rank-ordering in IRV, can cause the election result to 
<a href="IRVpartic.html">worsen</a> by
her reckoning. She in such cases would have been better off casting a dishonest 
rank-ordering, or not voting at all. 
</p><p>
But 
<a href="FairVoteLNHnonsense.html">FairVote</a> ignores all that, plus also pretends
that the most strategic way to approval-vote is to approve exactly <i>one</i> candidate,
and they further pretend that once approval voters are 
"aware" of this brilliant strategy that will give them a
"significant advantage over less informed voters."  That all was usually wrong advice!  Usually,
single-approval votes are <a href="Approval.html#pairsarg">not</a> 
the best strategy, so FairVote is giving its readers exactly the
<i>wrong</i> strategic advice, then pretending that advice was a hidden advantageous secret
only the FairVote geniuses knew. 
</p><p>
(<a href="RVstrat3.html">Comparison</a> of
various score &amp; approval voting strategies indicating the "mean based thresholding" 
strategy was the best one tried in all experiments with &ge;30 other voters; and "scaled honesty"
appears to be at least 2/3 as good as the best score-voting strategy in every experiment
tried so far.)
</p>

<h2>Why is LNH a silly criterion?</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b>
 Suppose Joe wins an election.  Don't you agree that, if Mary has
enough support, then Mary should have won?  Don't you agree that, if
Mary gets "Mary is my 2nd choice" votes from a lot of voters, that
ought to mean Mary is more-worthy of thus-winning?  In other
words, it is desirable for a voter to be allowed to indicate that she
also likes Mary, even if she likes Joe more.   
And it is desirable that this should
sometimes cause the election of Mary, not Joe, because that  extra
Mary-support tips the balance.
   So, objectively better election results are obtained, at least with
honest voting, in LNH-<i>dis</i>obeying voting systems than in LNH-obeying
voting systems.  I.e. objectively,
LNH is <i>not even a desirable property</i> with honest voters unlike (say)
<a href="Monotone.html">monotonicity</a>.
</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
 Now, one might argue that LNH <i>is</i> desirable with strategic=dishonest
voters.  Because
LNH hopefully will encourage the strategists to provide honest second
choices.  Without
LNH, they'd lie more. 
</p><p>
That's a sensible idea.  But if that is your view, and your
goal is to motivate
voters to provide honest 2nd choices, then it is better instead to use as your
criterion, the straightforward "with this voting method, providing an
honest 2nd choice, is never a
strategic mistake, i.e. never forces the election result to worsen
in that voter's perspective."   <i>That</i> would be exactly the criterion that
<i>truly</i> would motivate honest 2nd choices.  Call it the "HSC criterion"
(motivates Honest Second Choices). But since instant runoff voting (IRV) 
<a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">disobeys</a> that
superior criterion, the IRV propagandists at FairVote have always hidden
this issue. Instead, they very carefully word their LNH criterion, which we
now see is the <i>wrong</i> criterion for their very own declared goal, so
that IRV obeys it.  Then they <i>act</i> as though LNH=HSC, i.e. act as 
though LNH were the correct criterion, hoping nobody notices this sleight of hand.
And then they take
the deception even further &ndash; in the FairVote web page on this
(<a href="FairVoteLNHnonsense.html">local copy</a>) they actually
declared that this wrong LNH criterion was actually <i>the</i> pre-eminent
criterion which should "far outweigh" all others in importance for judging 
voting systems &ndash;
and if you disobey it, your voting method is doomed and should never even be
considered.  
</p><p>
This is absurd.
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
 And as long as we are worried about motivating honest 2nd choices,
why aren't we worried about honest <i>first</i> choices even more?  The "HF
criterion" would be, say,
"with this voting method, honestly scoring your 1st choice candidate
with the maximum allowed score (or top ranking), is never a
strategic mistake, i.e. never forces the election result to worsen
from that voter's perspective."  Well, IRV <a href="IRV1519.html">disobeys</a> HF.
(So do <a href="BordaExec.html">Borda</a>, <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, 
and every <a href="VenzkePf.html">Condorcet</a> method.)
Range and approval both obey HF.
It seems intuitively clear HF is more important than HSC, which in turn is
more important than LNH.  So the very chain of reasoning FairVote is using,
when redone correctly, actually leads us to support <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>
&amp; <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting,
and <i>not</i> support IRV &ndash; <i>exactly the opposite</i> of the
conclusion FairVote drew!
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
 All that was theory.  What about practice?
Well, in practice about 85% of Australian voters rank one major party top,
other bottom or 2nd to bottom, which is clear massive strategic
exaggeration voting behavior, and it causes major harm to Australia, making
it essentially impossible for a 3rd party to win an IRV seat.  In 3
consecutive house
elections (150 IRV seats each) in 
<a href="Aus01.txt">2001</a>, 
<a href="Aus04.txt">2004</a>, 
<a href="Aus07.html">2007</a>, 
their third parties won zero seats.  In the
4th (2010), they finally won one seat &ndash; the Green MP Adam Bandt.
</p><blockquote>
<small>
Aside: How did this miracle occur? 
Chip LeGrand: "Greens celebrate historic lower house victory,", <i>The Australian</i> 21 Aug. 2010
discusses this 
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/melb.htm">election</a>
in the "Melbourne inner city" district.
Bandt won with 56.1% of the final-round votes versus Cath Bowtell
(Labor party) who had 43.9%.  In the first IRV round, the top
contenders were
Bandt(Green) 36.2%, Bowtell(Labour) 38.1%, and Simon Olsen (Liberal) 21.0%, plus 4 
candidates from other parties 
("Family First", "Sex", "Democrats", and "Secular")
who in aggregate got 4.5%.  Australia's top two
parties are the Liberal/Nationals and Labour.  The Green party is a "third" party.
This was the first time a Green had ever won a House seat in a general election in
Australian history &ndash; but they had won one once before in a special election in which
one of the major parties did not run anybody &ndash;
and it happened because Olsen's voters almost
unanimously preferred Bandt over Bowtell.
So in this case IRV seems to have worked exactly as its proponents would hope.
</small>
</blockquote><p>
So strategic voting really happens in
IRV, at a  massive rate of occurrence, and it causes huge damaging effects.
</p><p>
But why?  Wasn't FairVote claiming those Australian voters, motivated by 
the wonderful wonderful essential pre-eminent LNH property of their voting system,
would vote honestly, not strategically?  Whatever is the matter with them?
</p><p>
I mean, if Australians supported
the Greens, why not rank Greens top, and then honestly as their 2nd
choice, name one of the two major
parties, and do this in the full confidence this 2nd choice will in no
way hurt their Green 1st choice?
</p><p>
  Well, experimentally, they don't.  Experimental fact is, that about 85% of
Australians vote the exaggerated way I described with the 2 major parties artificially
shoved to top &amp; bottom.  So any hope the LNH criterion will prevent
strategic voting, is just garbage in the real world.  And it is a <i>theorem</i>
that with IRV, if over 75% of voters vote for one of the two major parties top,
then it is <i>mathematically impossible</i> for any third party to win a seat.
Ever.
</p><p>
And this all is not some mere quibble.  
This is approximately the most massive refutation one could possibly have hoped for.
</p><p>
So: All this LNH nonsense spewed by FairVote is both theoretically <i>and</i>
experimentally bankrupt.
</p>
<h2> Going further </h2>
<p>
<b>5.</b>
But let us not completely waste our time.  Let's try to turn this investigation
into something useful, not merely yet another demonstration of the perpetual lies
"FairVote" continually spews as their standard modus operandi.
</p><p>
First of all, we just said HF is a good criterion.  And score and approval voting
both obey it, while
such other voting methods as IRV, Borda, Plurality, and Condorcet do not.
</p><p>
Second, we showed that if you like the LNH criterion, you obviously must
like the HSC criterion even more, although 
presumably not as much as you must like HF.
So, <b>Natural question:</b> 
Can we invent a voting method obeying <i>both</i> HF <i>and</i> HSC?
</p><p>
<b>Answer.</b>
No deterministic voting system based on rank-order ballots is possible
that obeys both HF and HSC, except for a "dictatorship" (i.e. one special voter, 
the 'dictator,' decides all election results all by himself).
Proof: this is a restatement of the famous
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>
in the case of 3-candidate elections.
</p><blockquote>
Jan Kok described this as:
"(For ranked-order-ballot deterministic non-dictator votng methods)
Later-no-harm implies earlier-yes-harm"!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the 2009 Burlington, VT mayoral <a href="Burlington.html">IRV election</a>, 
if you voted for the Republican as your favorite and you also preferred the Democrat 
over the Progressive, you shot yourself in the foot. You should have dishonestly voted for the 
Democrat as your first choice. That would have allowed the Democrat to win, instead 
of the Progressive who actually won.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In other words, voting for your favorite as your first choice can actually <i>harm</i> you.
</blockquote><p>
(<a href="WoodallP5.html">Woodall</a>
also proved some statements of the form "later no harm forces various kinds of
non-<a href="Monotone.html">monotonicity</a>.")
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
<i>But</i> the key phrase in that theorem statement was "based on rank-order ballots."
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score</a> voting is <i>not</i> based on rank-ordering the
candidates as ballots. 
It is based on numerically <i>scoring</i>  the candidates, as your ballot.
Could range voting thus manage to evade the
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem to achieve the holy grail of satisfying 
<i>both</i> HF and HSC in 3-candidate elections?  Even though neither IRV, nor any other 
rank-order ballot voting system, can?
</p><p>
The answer to that follow-up question is: "partially."
With score voting, honestly giving your true favorite candidate, the maximum score, is 
<i>always</i> strategic.  It can <i>never</i> worsen the election result from your perspective.
And also: With score voting, honestly giving the candidate you truly consider the worst,
the <i>min</i>imum score, also is 
always strategic and can never worsen the election result from your perspective.
So once you as a voter in a 3-candidate election
have done those two things, there is only one task remaining: 
to determine your score
for the candidate you honestly view as the middle one (i.e, your honest
second choice).  Choose whatever the strategically best score is (and if more than one
such score exists, then, e.g, choose the "most honest" within this strategically-best set).
So what have we now done?  We now have voted, using score voting, in a maximally strategic
way, and at the same time, in a "<i>semi</i>-honest" way &ndash; meaning
for every candidate pair (A,B) such that we honestly think A&gt;B,
we have stated scores on our ballot obeying A&ge;B and we've never <i>dis</i>honestly
scored as though A&lt;B.     [Also, for every (A,B) such that you honestly think A=B,
you can strategically score-vote fully honestly, i.e. such that your scores for A and B are equal.]
</p><p>
So with score voting (and this also works for approval voting)
in 3-choice elections, we've just <i>proven</i> it always is
possible to vote "semi-honestly."  
Indeed, with score voting, but not approval voting,
we actually can go a bit further:
with probability=1 if the other score-voters
include some continuum randomness (e.g. if at least one voter someplace scores randomly-uniformly
within the allowed-scores interval), then
it always is possible to score-vote <i>fully</i> honestly,
in the sense your scores obey the same &lt;, =, or &gt; relations as your honest opinion.
</p><p>
But the 
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>
shows that <i>no</i> 
rank-order ballot voting method &ndash; not IRV, not Borda, not Condorcet, 
not any of the infinite number of rank-order voting methods that nobody has
even invented yet &ndash; can say that, because for all of them, that feat is impossible.
With IRV or any such voting method, there are elections in which the <i>only</i> way for you to
get a good election result, is to flat-out 
<a href="IRV1519.html">lie</a> by pretending A&gt;B 
when your honest  belief about
that candidate pair is A&lt;B.
</p><p>
<small>
Think such "forced to lie" scenarios are uncommon?
Sorry, the Friedgut-Kalai-Nisan 2008
<a href="mani-focs.pdf">quantitative</a>
<a href="FKKN.pdf">version</a>
of the
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem would appear to kill that hope...
and if we are only taking about IRV, then
our <a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">computer simulations</a> definitely kill it.
</small>
</p><p>
So, things are really looking quite bad for FairVote's so-called argument "against"
score voting and "for" IRV at this point.
<!--  &ndash; IRV forces you to vote dishonestly. -->
</p><p>
And it's about to get even worse.  
Now, let's forget about 3-candidate elections; let's go to C-candidate
elections for <i>any</i> C&ge;3.  In that case, I claim this 
<b>theorem:</b> with score or approval voting
(either work) if you knew everybody else's vote, you always could select a vote that would  
simultaneously be:
</p><ol type="i">
<li>
maximally strategic (assuring the best possible election result in your view), and
</li><li>
semi-honest, i.e. for any candidate-pair (A,B), if you honestly consider A&gt;B your vote
features scores A&ge;B; 
while if you honestly consider A=B then your vote's scores obey A=B.
</li><li>
With score (but now not with approval) voting we can further claim that
with probability=1 if the other score-voters
include some continuum randomness, then it always is possible to score-vote <i>fully</i> honestly,
in the sense your scores obey the same &lt;, =, or &gt; relations as your honest opinion.
</li><li>
No non-dictatorial deterministic rank-order-ballot voting method (including, of course, IRV) 
can achieve (i) and (ii)  simultaneously even in the simplest case 
C=3 of 3-candidate elections, and even for voters who knew the votes from everybody else.
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
(iv) is just the 
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite</a> impossibility theorem.
And (i) &amp; (ii) are accomplished thus: find the <i>b</i>est candidate 
(in your reckoning &ndash; call him B)
whom your score-vote could elect.  Give B the maximum score.  Give all better candidates
that same max score, and give all worse candidates the <i>min</i>imum score.
Now, to show (iii), perturb all C scores by amounts smaller than &epsilon; in such a way 
that the ordering
becomes fully honest and all candidates in the upper, and all in the lower group,
are each equi-spaced.   
With probability=1 there will exist some &epsilon; small enough
that this vote will still elect B.
For example, any &epsilon; less than (2C)<sup>-1</sup> times the minimum spacing
between the candidates' summed-scores from all the other voters, will work.
</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>
So approval voting, and even better score voting, both accomplish precisely 
the dishonesty-discouraging feats FairVote claimed to
want (once their idiocy and deceptions are corrected), and 
do so not only to a greater extent than IRV does,
but also than <i>any</i> rank-order-ballot voting method can.
It is mind-boggling that FairVote claims to use all this as an argument <i>against</i> 
Approval and Score voting and <i>for</i> IRV.  
</p><p>
More generally, FairVote, over and over, tries
to take the strategy of Appealing to the Idiot.  They come up with arguments that sound 
naively appealing to people who've never thought about voting systems before, then push
them whether or not they have any actual validity, and no matter how absurd they really are,
and apparently never correcting themselves even after years of actual experts pointing
their nonsense out.
