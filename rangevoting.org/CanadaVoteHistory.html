<H2> Critical history of Canadian voting-system reform attempts 2000-2015 </H2>

<p>
We will describe all the most prominent attempts to reform (and suggestions for reforming)
Canada's electoral system during 2000-2015.
Up to 2015, all failed to be enacted.  In many cases (we shall see) this failure was deserved, 
in the
sense that the proposals clearly are easily improvable and/or
contain major flaws &ndash; or at least severe risks those are flaws.
Which we'll point out.  For our own proposals, which largely or entirely avoid those flaws, 
and seem better and/or simpler,
see <a href="CanadaOverview.html">/CanadaOverview.html</a>.

The Failure of Electoral Reform Proposals in Canada,
Political Science December 61,2 (2009) 21-40.
  The case for electoral reform in Canada is compelling, and the issue has been actively 
debated for many years both federally and provincially. A strong and active lobby organisation
(Fair Vote Canada) continues to advance the cause, yet no reform proposal has ever been adopted. 
At the federal level, a serious proposal by the Law Commission was put forward in 2004, but
its report was ignored and the commission was subsequently disbanded by the federal government.
Five of the ten provinces have also seriously considered electoral reform. However, 
reform proposals failed to move forward in New Brunswick and Quebec, largely because of the
ambivalence of governing parties. Referendums on reform proposals have taken place in 
British Columbia (2005, 2009), Prince Edward Island (2005), and Ontario (2007). All were defeated.
   Governments are typically reluctant, and numerous veto points exist. Powerful interests 
can be mobilised against it, particularly in a referendum campaign. This article considers 
the lessons of the Canadian experience, with particular emphasis on the 
Ontario Citizens' Assembly.

amongst the province's electorate, partisan self-interest, and a lack of
information regarding the referendum."

<h3> Law Commission of Canada report (<a href="J31-61-2004E.pdf">pdf</a>) of 2004 </h3>

<p>
A serious proposal was produced for Canada (at the federal level)
by the Law Commission in 2004, but
their report was ignored and the commission
disbanded.
</p><p>
Even though the report was 232 pages, it could not bring itself to mention 
approval and score voting, and in general most or all modern ideas (post-1950) are ignored.
</p><p>
On p.175 it finally makes its "Recommendations" which are (edited by me for conciseness):
</p><ol>
<li>
Add an element of proportionality to Canada's electoral system.
</li><li>
Specifically, adopt an MMP (mixed member proportional) system.
</li><li>
The MMP system should be based on giving
voters TWO votes: one for a constituency representative and one for
a party list.
</li><li>
2/3 of parliament should be FPTP single-winner-in-riding seats.
The remaining 1/3 should be party lists (in each province or territory, not nationwide lists).
[I've omitted some further minor details.]
</li><li>
Parliament should adopt a <i>flexible</i> list system that provides voters with
the option of either endorsing the party "slate/ticket," or of
indicating a preference for a candidate within the list.
</li><li>
Parliament should require political parties to develop initiatives and
policies to promote equal representation of women... 
and increase racial minorities... and youth... 
and aboriginal peoples... and submit 
reports describing how they addressed those issues.
</li><li>
A Parliamentary committee should subsequently review the parties' reports.
</li><li>
A party should be eligible for compensatory provincial list seats only if it
presents candidates for election in at least one-third of the constituencies
in the relevant province.
</li></ol>

<p>
I think they already blew it on item 3 (see also item 8)
because independent MPs are
inherently treated massively unfairly.  
The whole issue of independent MPs is totally ignored 
by their report.
Item 4 also stinks since FPTP is simply a <a href="Plurality.html">bad</a>
way to choose single winners.
Item 5 is also suspect because plurality-style vote-totals are probably a bad way to
compute a list-ordering &ndash; average scores using 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">ratings</a>-style ballots (or even
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style ballots) seem far superior.
Also, one could have made everything simpler for voters via
PR systems only needing <i>one</i> ballot, not two.
</p>

<h3> British Columbia electoral reform referenda of 2005 and 2009 </h3>

<p>
The "Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform"
wanted to replace the existing "first past the post" 
(FPTP) in single-member ridings system, with a single transferable vote system (BC-STV).
BC-STV won by 57.7% in 2005 (1.7 million voters), 
but this referendum was not binding unless the support exceeded 60%.
Then in 2009 a binding referendum was held (1.6 million voters), whereupon
BC-STV lost by 61-39 landslide, hence the FPTP system was retained.
(Both these referenda put together total 51.31% against BC-STV.)
<!--
year    2005    2009    3295905
NO    719716 + 971350 = 1691066
YES   981419 + 623420 = 1604839
-->
</p><p>
It is noteworthy that the proposed BC-STV system was <i>not</i>
described on the referendum itself,
probably because its proposers felt it was too complicated to describe.  
The exact wording of the referendum was:
</p><blockquote>
Which electoral system should British Columbia 
use to elect members to the provincial Legislative Assembly?
<ul><li>
 The existing electoral system (First-Past-the-Post)
</li><li>
 The single transferable vote electoral system (BC-STV) proposed by the 
Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The BC-STV system also was <i>not</i> described in the STV proponents'
video
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-4_yuK-K-k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-4_yuK-K-k</a>), 
although it did provide an extremely vague sketch.
The BC-STV system also was <i>not</i> described in this
20-page official <a href="BCSTVreport.pdf">Final Report</a> CAER put out, 
although that also contained a vague sketch.
<!-- CAER claims they use an STV "transfer value" method invented by JB Gregory in 1880. -->
Apparently that was because even a 20-page report 
still was not enough to handle actually defining
the system.  For the definition, readers of the "final report" 
were referred to the "Technical Report" claimed to be
"available at public libraries, universities and colleges
throughout the province."
</p><p>
Oh.
</P><p>
Let us imagine the reaction of a voter, especially one who hadn't been paying much attention,
upon seeing this choice.
"What the hell does BC-STV even <i>mean</i>?" is her first question.
(The referendum question could not even be bothered to unpack the acronym!)
Perhaps a copy of the 20-page 
<a href="BCSTVreport.pdf">Final Report</a> 
is available for perusal at her polling place,
but, while very glossy and full of beautiful color pictures of smiling people and abstract art,
it simply does not contain a system definition.  (It does admit its absence and refer people
to local universities, though.  Thank you ever so much.)  That's it, game over,
says any voter even remotely like me.  There is no way in hell I am voting for this 
proposal if they cannot even define it in their 20-page report.  I have absolutely no idea how the 
"Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform" possibly imagined they could possibly achieve
referendum success in this manner!
</p><p>
Suggestion: the definition of the system should fit on
a single page, distributed at polling places, otherwise forget about it.
</p><p>
But I finally tracked down the actual BC-STV definition stated in that technical report, 
and <a href="BCSTVdefn.html">here</a> it is! (There's also this 
<a href="BC-STV-counting.pdf">PDF</a> containing a flow chart
on page 2, and this "<a href="WIGCountExampleFinal.pdf">detailed example</a>.")
The whole proposal would basically <b>convert BC into a pretty close copy of Ireland.</b>
</p><p>
The old FPTP system involved 79 ridings throughout BC
in 2005 (but 85 in 2009), each with population about 50000.
In the BC-STV proposal
ridings would be combined to become about 5 times the population, i.e. now 250000 each.
Each riding now would elect not one, but rather 5, representatives.
(Actually, numbers between 2 and 7 were permitted, but apparently 5 was typical.)
Each ballot would be a rank-ordering of the candidates, but voters would be allowed to 
rank-order only some (indeed, even only one!), 
not all, of the candidates, if they desired (the rest being automatically 
ranked co-equal last).
If, say, 7 candidates ran for each of the 5 seats (note there were
7.3 candidates per seat in the Canada-wide
1993 federal parliamentary elections) then each voter could rank
all 35 candidates in rank-order &ndash; a difficult and error-prone task &ndash; or fewer.
This is very distortionary because 
if you don't know anything about a candidate hence intentionally choose not to rank them,
then you probably did <i>not</i>
think they were the worst candidate ever, co-equal with Hitler and 
Stalin.  Actually, that probably would be the largest possible distortion of your opinions.
</p><p>
The video claims that the BC-STV system is "proportional" and will give a party 40% of
the seats "as nearly as possible"
if they have 40% of the votes.  That's PR &ndash; proportional representation.
(This, by the way, is not at all obvious from the system 
<a href="BCSTVdefn.html">definition</a>.)
However, since each riding elects 5 winners, 
the only allowed seat-fractions are 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%, hence
errors in proportionality of up to &plusmn;10% of the total number
of seats in parliament could happen.   That would be far more than enough
to completely zero the Green Party, which got only 6.78% even in its best-ever vote-percentage
result Canada-wide in 2008.  
So under the BC-STV "proportional" system, if adopted Canada-wide, we would expect
the Greens to get zero seats, even though, proportionally speaking, they deserved 21 seats
in 2008.
</p><p>
Oops.
</p><p>
Further problems:  The BC-STV system 
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">suffers</a> many "pathologies,"
aka "paradoxical self-contradictions."
For example, it can exhibit <a href="Monotone.html">nonmonotonicity</a>
where a voter by raising a candidate 
on her rank ordering,
can make him <i>lose</i>, and by lowering the candidate can make him <i>win</i>.
It can be more-strategic to not vote at all, than to cast an honest rank-ordering vote.
BC-STV can <a href="IRVamp.html">refuse</a>
to elect a candidate who would defeat any of his rivals by a large margin
in a head-to-head 2-choice election.  
It also can elect somebody and regard them as the "best" candidate while
if all ballot rank-orderings were 
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversed</a>
(so we were now trying to figure out the 
worst, not the best candidate!)
it <i>still</i> would elect that same candidate and <i>still</i> contend he was the "best"!
Also, it is simply false to contend (as some did) that STV eliminates the "wasted vote" 
problem &ndash; there can still be "<a href="IRV1519.html">spoiler</a>" 
candidates who lose but, by running, 
prevent X from winning
(if they dropped out, X would win).
A vote for such a spoiler sure sounds "wasted" to me.
And many of these pathologies occur <a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">frequently</a>;
they are not rare.
</p><p>
Also, BC-STV could <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">only</a>
be counted centrally.  It would be impossible to count it in precincts.
</p><p>
Also, if voters tried the naive but highly appealing (about 85% of Australian voters use this 
strategy) <a href="NESD.html">strategy</a>
of (1) determine the two parties most likely to win, (2) rank
them top and bottom (or reverse), (3) rank the other parties in between somehow,
then we are guaranteed to get extremely disproportional results yielding massive
2-party domination &ndash; which incidentally is exactly the situation in Malta, 
one of the most important users of a system of the BC-STV kind.
</p><p>
On the bright side, I like the fact BC-STV produces PR <i>without</i> need of party labels.
Christy Clark (Liberal MLA who became BC Premier in 2011)
in this 2009 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhccpzI4lbQ">video</a>
explains why she was opposed to BC-STV in 2005 but in 2009 supported it
(thanks to Ron Campbell for pointing it out).  More pro-STV

Canadian govt <a href="BC2005STVreport.pdf">report</a>
discussing the 2005 referendum.
Essentially, BC-STV was unappealing, complicated, 
would have made ridings so large that many people would have felt unrepresented,
and the Liberal Party's support for it
dropped perhaps due to their realization they have tended to benefit
from <i>dis</i>proportional representation. 
</p><p>
An Angus Reid poll on 15 May 2005 found that 66% of BC voters 
claimed to know "nothing" or "very little" about BC-STV (the referendum was held 17 May),
A Nordic Research poll (May 31 to 1 June 2005)
found that 53% of those who voted against BC-STV
did so because they did not feel knowledgeable. 
</p><p>
The 2009 
BC referendum would have required 60% overall supermajority plus &ge;50%
approval in at least 60% of the province's electoral districts in order to succeed
(same rules in Ontario and PEI referenda we discuss below).
Dennis <a href="http://wrestlingwithdemocracy.blogspot.ca/">Pilon</a> branded those rules as
</p><blockquote>
The Liberals clearly stacked the deck against any
change occurring by establishing a super-majority threshold 60%... for STV...
despite the fact that there existed no compelling legal or historical precedents for doing
so [D.Pilon: <i>The politics of voting</i>,
Emond Montgomery Publications 2007 pp. 103-4]. 
While some Canadian scholars argue that these measures were not 
deliberately designed to ensure defeat [Carty, Blais and Fournier 2008; 144, 157], more
comparative accounts tend to characterize these decisions as a strategy of "process
manipulation" by the politicians 
[Alan Renwick: <i>The politics of electoral reform</i>, Cambridge Univ. Press 2010 p.77].
<br>

</blockquote>

<!--
The BC 61% margin (60.91% more precisely) was exceeded only once by the fraction 
of the vote won by a US president (61.05% in 1964). Hence at least in the USA 61%
would be called "landslide."  Meanwhile 57% or greater was achieved 8 times among the 
28 USA presidential elections after 1900. That's a strong performance, but hardly stunning.  
The two referenda combined yield NO by about 52-48.
   Neither the Liberals, Tories, or NDP took a stance about the BC-STV referendum in
either 2005 or 2009.  However, the Liberals initiated the process to have the 2005 referendum
(interpretable as favoring it) but made clearly-biased referendum rules (60% margin needed
for YES), which one could interpret as being opposed. Some NDP leaders spoke out against BC-STV;
and top Green leaders spoke against it in 2005 but for it in 2009.
My analysis suggests the BC-STV system would have had a large anti-Green effect, 
but less large than FPTP's. The BC-STV 2009 referendum got $500K per side in 
government-supplied advertising money, plus $200K were raised by the "pro" 
and $20K for the "anti" sides.  The government in contrast supplied $800K total (all sides)
in 2005.  Pilon argues both these budgets were low considering the government was spending 
over $5million anyhow to hold the 2005 referendum and process.
As far as I can tell, BC voters were more informed about STV in 2009 than 2005, 
but overall quite ignorant both times.

<h3> Ontario electoral reform referendum of 2007 </h3>

<p>
The proposal was to stop electing Ontario's provincial parliament 
via First Past the Post (FPTP) single winner ridings.
The "Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform" instead 
proposed a simple mixed member proportional representation (MMP) system
mildly resembling <b>Germany's Bundestag.</b>
Each voter would cast two votes:
<ol><li>
one for a local candidate, and
</li><li>
one for a political party.
</li></ol><p>
The local member would be elected according to the usual 
<a href="Plurality.html">FPTP</a> mechanism. 
(Which is peculiar because the proponents of this reform all agreed FPTP was a bad system!)
However, there would also be a number of "list seats." The second ballot 
would be used to determine what share of total seats (local + list) 
should be proportionately assigned to each party to ensure proportionality of the overall result.
The proposed Legislature would have 129 seats consisting of 90 local members 
(70% of the Legislature) plus 39 list members (30%).
List members would be chosen in order from a ranked list of candidates proposed by each party 
before the election.
</p><p>
What if you are an independent (not affiliated with a party!) candidate?  Oh sorry:
you are intentionally, by design of the law of the land, shafted.
That's what they call "reform."
</p><p>
The parties' "deserved numbers of seats" would be computed from their vote shares 
(from the 2nd part of the ballots <i>only</i>) 
via the <a href="Apportion.html#hamvint">Hamilton-Vinton</a> largest-remainder rounding-off
method (formerly used in the USA for "apportionment," but later abandoned). 
This rounding off method is known to suffer from the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox">Alabama paradox</a>,"
which is why the USA abandoned it.  Hamilton-Vinton isn't horrible but the consensus opinion
backed up by computer simulations is
that it appears to be worse than
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method">Sainte-Lagu&euml;</a>'s method.
</p><p>
The referendum question exact wording (English only, I'm omitting the parallel French wording) was:
</p><blockquote>
Which electoral system should Ontario use to elect members to the provincial legislature? 
<ul><li>
The existing electoral system (First-Past-the-Post)
</li><li>
The alternative electoral system proposed by the Citizens' Assembly (Mixed Member Proportional) 
</li><ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The MMP proposal was defeated by 63-37 landslide margin.
</p>
<p>
The "closed list" system removes individual accountability, assuring election of
those near the top of their party's pre-decided list. To try to counter that criticism:
"Before the election, parties will be required to submit their lists, as well as the details
of the <i>process</i> they used to nominate their list candidates, to Elections Ontario &ndash; a
non-partisan body. Elections Ontario will publish this information widely. Voters will be
able to assess whether parties created their lists in a fair and transparent way."
</p><p>
Also, the proposed system still retains all
the well-known flaws of FPTP in electing its local MPs.  They could have,
for example, switched that part to approval voting, an easy and clear improvement,
but no.  The whole point of a "local MP" in systems of this ilk, is to be the best choice in
the opinion of his riding.  So we should use a method which is <i>good</i> at producing
single-choices, not a <i>bad</i> such system like FPTP, which is what Ontario chose
in a clear design mistake.  (Plus, this change as a beneficial side effect would probably
make the local MPs more proportional, thus reducing the number of needed MMP top-up seats.)
</p>

<h3> Prince Edward Island 2005, New Brunswick 2008, and Quebec electoral reform referenda </h3>

<p>
These were three other MMP proposals,  each apparently quite
similar to Ontario 2007.
(PEI's proposal involved d'Hondt's rounding-off <a href="Apportion.html">method</a> 
instead of Ontario's Hamilton-Vinton, and a 5% threshold for small parties to 
access list-seats.)
PEI's lost by even larger 64-36 landslide. 
New Brunswick planned to hold a referendum on this
early in May 2008, but didn't.
Finally, Quebec's effort apparently died even before proposing a referendum date.
PEI's question wording:
"Should Prince Edward Island change to the Mixed Member Proportional System 
as presented by the Commission of PEI's Electoral Future?"
</p>
<p>
<b>Why didn't it pass?</b>
<a href="PEIfailedReform2005Lea.pdf">Jeannie Lea</a>
[Canad. Parliamentary Review (Spring 2006) 4-8]
claims that 
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
 the committee designing the proposal complained unsuccessfully that
they did not have enough time, 
</li><li>
 the plebiscite rules demanded a 60% supermajority for passage,
</li><li>
 it was a standalone plebiscite, not held on the same day as any other election,
</li><li>
 the "no" side spread distrust/fear about the reform,
</li><li>
 the main political parties did not support the reform.  
</li></ol>
Note (e) was unsurprising
in the sense that the main parties automatically
tended with FPTP to be over-represented in parliament,
so any PR reform was contrary to their interests.
</p><p>
If we ask why the similar Ontario 2007 reform did not pass,
then the reasons are probably similar.
William Kuchapski
[<a href="Kuchapski.pdf">Why Electoral Reform Failed in Ontario?</a>
Manitoba Law Journal 36,2 (2013) 137-156] claims they were
"partisan self-interest, electorate apathy, and a lack of information"
about the proposal provided to the public.
</p><p>
There also is a 60-page long <a href="LeDucEtAlOntarioFail2008.pdf">report</a> on the
Ontario  failure by L.LeDuc et al [later condensed to
Lawrence LeDuc: <i>The Failure of Electoral Reform Proposals in Canada</i>,
Political Science 61,2 (Dec. 2009) 21-40], which claimed
"The press was hostile, and the
public information campaign inadequate...
<i>Three quarters</i> of those polled in the first
week of October [the referendum date was 10 October]
indicated that they had heard 'only a little' or 'nothing at all' about the issue...
The Citizens' Assembly was an unknown entity for most of the electorate...
There was relatively little
information to be had, and only the most pro-active voters were likely to find it...
Modern campaigns cost money, and the lack of any serious funding of the campaign for
MMP undercut its effectiveness and deprived voters of the information that they needed to
properly evaluate the proposed reform...
There was no real need for an organized NO effort; 
the doubts raised by skeptical journalists more or less did the job...
The more complex the issue, the greater the difficulty of putting it across to
voters in a short campaign..."
</p><p>
Although the pro-PR forces probably were motivated by the BC-STV failure then to push
simpler MMP systems... strangely enough, all the MMP defeats were greater-landslide defeats
than the BC-STV defeat.
</p>

<h3> Year-2015 proposals by FairVote Canada as videos (each 6-8 minutes long)
</h3>

<p><b>A. "MMP proposal"</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3guVBhKmDc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3guVBhKmDc</a>
(Video narrated by Dennis Pilon, associate professor of political science at York University
and one of the founders of FairVote Canada.)
297 local MPs, plus 131 regional MPs in 27 top-up regions.
Voters cast vote for both local rep, and for a regional rep, using open lists.
Each ballot has two parts:
</p><ol><li>
vote-for-1 local MP. 
</li><li>
vote-for-1-party (or for 1 candidate,
which counts as a vote for his party) for regional MP.  
</li></ol><p>
Part 2 is considerably larger,
since contains many more candidates.  In the "sample ballot" they gave at 3:12  for
"Ottawa South" riding in "Eastern Ontario" region, there were 5 local candidates, and 
46 regional candidates, from 5 parties.  <i>None</i> were independent.
It's pretty absurd to make voters choose among 46 candidates.  I do not believe most
voters will be able to keep track of that many.  Amazingly considering the huge size of
their ballots, voters are forced to provide only an incredibly small amount of information
with the "name one then shut up" style voting.  
The whole issue of independent MPs was simply not even mentioned during the entire video.
At 4:12 they claim no strategic voting, and no vote-splitting, can exist with their method.
Those claims both are simply <b>false</b>.  First of all, in part 1 of the ballot, since it is
just single-winner plurality voting for the local MP, there can easily be vote-splitting between 
alike candidates, and there can easily be strategic decisions 
not to "waste your vote" by voting for Ralph Nader (to allude to 
the USA 2000 presidential election) thus inspiring voters to dishonestly vote for a candidate
who is not their true favorite.  Second, in part 2 of the ballot, suppose your favorite
party is going to get X seats, and your vote for that party 
clearly is not going to be enough to raise
that to X+1 seats.  But, if you lie in your vote by voting for a <i>different</i> party
(which you also like, although less)
<i>that</i> would be enough to give <i>them</i>
1 extra seat.  In such a circumstance, you indeed would
be an idiot to tell the truth in your vote, and strategic voting is wise.
</p><p>
They then "simulate" the election results based on year-2011 data finding at 5:10
that the 10 local ridings in Eastern Ontario would elect
<pre>
Conserv=6, Lib=3, NDP=1, Green=0 seats (total=10 local);
</pre>
then the top-ups would elect 
<pre>
Conserv=2, Lib=1, NDP=2, Green=1 seats (total=6 top-up); 
</pre>
for in all 
<pre>
Conserv=8, Lib=4, NDP=3, Green=1 (total 16 seats).
</pre>
The video does not describe the precise way they determine the party shares from the
votes, instead merely making the vague claim that 37% of the votes will yield 37% of the seats.
Well, 37% of <i>which</i> votes?  (Remember, there are two kinds of votes, since
your ballot has two parts.)
They do not say.   And obviously, in their 16-seat example
they just gave, 37% of the seats would be 5.9 seats.   That is not possible.  So
there will be some distortion caused by integer roundoff at the very least, causing
each party's seat-count to be off by up to &plusmn;3% of the total #seats in parliament.

<p><b>B. "Jenkins-inspired MMP proposal"</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk</a>
(Video again narrated by Dennis Pilon, associate professor of political science
at York University.)
Rank-order ballot for local MPs.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk&t=1m42s">1:42</a>
"on its own, single member preference voting [<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>] 
does not create [proportionality]."
Hence (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk&t=1m55s">1:55</a>) 
their plan is to add "top-ups in regions" to convert IRV in ridings 
into a "semi-proportional system."
203 local MPs, plus 135 regional MPs, in 42 top-up regions.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk&t=3m00s">3:00</a>: 
"The small size of the top-up regions would mean the parliament would not be fully 
proportional" by which I presume they mean that the obstacle is rounding-off 
to (necessarily small) integers.  (Or, since the video calls this only a "<i>semi</I>proportional"
system, for some unexplained reason, perhaps they have some additional obstacle in mind.)
Obviously that same roundoff obstacle occurs in their proposal 
A too, but they there had pretended there was no obstacle!  Well, I think 
what they are trying to say is, 
with proposal A there were 27 top-up regions, but with B there are 42,
so therefore with A they can get more accurate proportionality within each (since larger) 
region.
At 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyHLwYq6Nk&t=4m09s">4:09</a>
they again consider the typical(?) 
"Ottawa South" riding in "Eastern Ontario" region, now
there were 5 local candidates running for 1 local seat (and there would be
5 ridings, hence 5 local seats, in this region), plus
24 candidates vying for 3 regional top-up seats.
A voter rank-orders the 5 local candidates (and then one is chosen via the IRV process)
and also names a single one of the 24 candidates (or simply names one party).
Then by a mathemagical process they <i>do not describe</i>, somehow the
top-ups are elected in a way that attempts to restore proportionality
(and they also do not explain exactly what proportionality <i>means</i> &ndash; e.g. it is a
share of <i>what</i> votes?).  
In their example, this time the Green party gets zero seats, as contrasted with proposal A
where the Greens got 1 seat, from Eastern Ontario.
Again, independent MPs are nowhere mentioned in the entire video.
This proposal inherently makes it 
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">impossible</a>
to count ballots in 
precincts and forces centralized counting.
</p>

<p>
<b>Non-definition:</b>
It is astonishing to me that in <i>neither</i> video A or B, did FairVote Canada
actually <i>define</i> the PR voting process they had in mind!
They used vague 
happy-sounding words, but there is no precise definition. Ever.
</p><p>
Here's a hint.  If your system is so hard for you to define that you cannot do it in an 
8-minute professionally produced video, then either it is too hard to define, or
you are incompetent. Or both.
</p><p>
It's hard for me to issue precise <b>criticisms</b>,
given that, I repeat, no precise definition of any voting systems has been given
in either FairVote video A or B.
</p><p>
I will say this, though.   The reliance on plurality-style "name one candidate then shut up"
ballots in (A), and on rank-order ballots in (B1), both are <b>design mistakes.</b>
Approval-style, and rating-style, ballots respectively are superior.
This superiority is in terms of (1) lower ballot-error rates, (2) faster voter speed,
(3) inherently provides more information, 
(4) to some extent avoids "<a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow theorem</a>" 
and related inherent impossibilities, (5) ratings ballots allow voters who wish to
express ignorance, to do so without introducing distortion, (6) "dumber" voting machines
can be used.
</p><p>
Also, I again suspect that if voters employ the naive-exaggeration 
<a href="NESD.html">strategy</a>
of ranking the top two parties artificially first and last, then both these systems
will force 2-party domination and massive disproportionality.

<p><b>C. "Stephane Dion's P3 proposal"</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyLeClCrfgQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyLeClCrfgQ</a>;
I did not actually watch this video because Dion had provided written
versions of his proposal
as 
<a href="https://stephanedion.liberal.ca/en/articles-en/p3-voting-system-canada/">
https://stephanedion.liberal.ca/en/articles-en/p3-voting-system-canada</a>
(short version) and
a more detailed longer &ndash; 15 pages &ndash; version 
[<a href="Dion_ang.pdf">Which Voting System is Best for Canada?</a>
Federal News 3,4 (April 2012) 1-15].
<!-- http://ideefederale.ca/documents/Dion_ang.pdf -->
</p><p>
1. Ridings each would elect 5 MPs, not one (and the ridings each would be 5 times larger than now).
("Or perhaps four or three when a low population density warrants it. 
There would be some exceptions &ndash;
such as the territories which, for practical reasons, 
would remain one-member districts.  But the standard would be five-member districts.")
</p><p>
2. At the ballot box, voters would rank-order parties in order of their preferences.
(Also allowed: ranking some but not all, in order.  Including: just picking <i>one</i>.)
Second, voters would select their preferred candidate among those put forward by the 
party they select as their top preference. Let's say that a 
voter chooses the Liberal party as his or her top reference; 
this voter then would choose one candidate among the five liberals.
</p><p>
3. Here's how to count.
First, the voters' top-preferences would be counted. 
If one or more parties failed to obtain enough first choices to win at least one of the five seats
(namely, I presume, at least 1/6 of the votes?), then the party that got the smallest 
number would be eliminated and its voters' second choices would be transferred 
to the remaining parties. The successive choices of the voters for eliminated parties 
would be allocated until all of the parties still in the running obtain a least one seat.
The precise number of seats each of the remaining parties then got would then somehow
be determined by some rounding-off procedure that Dion does not actually specify(!)
but I suppose could be chosen from among the <a href="Apportion.html">usual suspects</a>.
</p><p>
4. Then, the voters' choices as to their preferred candidate among those attached to
their preferred party are counted. If a party obtains two seats, that party's 
two candidates who received the highest number of votes would win those two seats.
</p><p>
<b>Flaws in P3:</b>
<ol type="a"><li>
Suppose the Liberal party runs 5 candidates A,B,C,D,E 
in some riding. 
A is unanimously agreed by all voters in that riding, to be the best 
person in the universe. 
So they all vote Liberal+A.   But now the liberals win all 5 seats, 
which is bad because B,C,D,E were all corrupt bastards, and honest Tories 
would have been superior.  Point is, B,C,D,E "rode A's coattails" into 
office.  P3 creates inter-candidate correlations, via parties, which 
is not necessarily good. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The voters could instead try to avoid this fate by voting Tory, but 
then A can't get elected. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Either way, it stinks.  Or, the voters could vote dishonestly. That 
might work better, but if so, the fact this is required, is not good. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think that scenario is unlikely?  Well, one way I think it actually might 
realistically arise in the form where it wasn't the liberals, it was 
the Greens, 
and A was some world-renowned environmentalist, but Greens B,C,D,E 
were nobodies likely to be disasters as MPs... 
</li><li>
P3 would elect zero Greens even in Canada's 2008 election featuring
6.78% Green votes (its best-ever vote-percentage).
</li><li>
Tory voters are not allowed to express their preferences among the Liberal candidates.
</li><li>
What about independent (party unaffiliated) candidates?  Blatantly unfair to them.
</li><li>
If voters employ the naive-exaggeration strategy
of ranking the top two parties artificially first and last, then P3
will force 2-party domination and massive disproportionality.
</li></ol><p>
I think P3 is an interesting "ad hoc" design,
hopefully working pretty well for the very particular numbers that Dion expects.
I like Dion's transferable-vote-among-parties idea as a way to assure proportionality
(albeit if only 5 MPs are elected, then large proportionality errors are inevitable
including necessarily "zeroing out the Greens"),
<i>but</i>: it forces the voters to supply rank-orderings, which is a problematic ballot-type;
and it forces the system to be counted centrally, making precinct-based-counting 
<a href="IrvNonAdd.html">impossible</a>;
and it causes P3 to massively fail <a href="NESD.html">NESD</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
All the proposals above have major flaws.
None of the three year-2015 proposals has actually been fully specified.
None of them employ modern ideas (post-1950) except for Dion's P3 system, which seems
quite original.
