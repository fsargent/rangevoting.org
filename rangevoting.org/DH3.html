<H2> The DH3 "Dark Horse plus 3 rivals" pathology </H2>

<p>
<a href="DH3Summ.html">(Executive summary)</a>
</p>

<p>
Many voting system "pathologies" or "paradoxes" or "bad behaviors"
have been noticed over the years.
But some are more worrisome and damaging than others:
<ul>
<li>
The most damaging ones are those that cause the
<i>worst</i> possible winner to be elected.
(Of course, even if they cause the <i>second-best</i> winner to be
elected instead of the best, that also is bad. But not as bad.)
</li>
<li>
The ones that are most damaging arise <i>often</i> in actual practice.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The DH3 pathology is a very very bad pathology by those measures, and it
affects a lot of voting systems.  (In view of its frequency and seriousness,
some would not use the word "affects."
They would use the word "destroys.")
In particular most (every?) "Condorcet 
method with full A>B>C>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;>Z rank-orderings
as votes" suffers from DH3.  (That includes <a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>,
Tideman's <a href="RankedPairs.html">ranked pairs</a>, and Schulze's
<a href="SchulzeComplic.html">beatpaths</a> systems.)
Also, so does the <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda system</a>.
Permitting equalities in vote-rankings,
using either <a href="WinningVotes.html">winning votes</a> or margins,
does not avoid the DH3 pathology,
although I initially thought they might work for that purpose.
(<a href="WVmore.html">Answers to questions about that</a>.)
But range voting, 
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, and <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
are immune to DH3. <small>
In the example below,
strategic Range Voters would simply rank one of A,B,C max and everybody else min.
C would win.</small>
</p>

<H3>What is DH3?</H3>  
<p>
It is simply this.  Suppose there are 3 main rival
candidates A, B, &amp; C,
who all have some good virtues.  This happens a lot.
(In fact, whenever it doesn't happen, the situation is uninteresting &ndash; only 2 real contenders &ndash;
and we almost
might as well just be using the <a href="Plurality.html"> plurality</a> voting system.)
Let us suppose support is roughly equally divided
among those three, say 31%, 32%, and 37%, although the precise numbers do not matter much.
Suppose also there are one or more additional "dark horse" candidates whom nobody
takes seriously as contenders because they stink.  For simplicity assume there is only  one
dark horse D, but what we are going to say also
works (indeed works even more powerfully)
with more than one.
</p>

<p>
Now, what happens?  The A-supporters say to themselves:
"We are in trouble.  Polls suggest A is going to lose if we just vote A>B>C>D
as is our honest opinion.  But if we exaggeratedly vote A>D>B>C downgrading A's main
rivals as far as we can, then maybe A will have a chance."
The B-supporters say "those rotten A-supporters for sure are going to exaggerate
and effectively get <i>twice</i> the A-versus-B discriminating power as if they
were honest.  We cannot sit still and just take that.
We have to fight back by also exaggerating: B>D>C>A."
And similarly the C-supporters say "we will not just sit back
and be robbed of our deserved victory by those dishonest exaggerating scum.  We
will also exaggerate:  C>D>A>B."  (And by the way, they are completely right.
C would definitely lose to A or B if they just sat there.)
</p>

<a href="rangeVborda.html#DH3ex">Pictorial example</a> under Borda;
<a href="WinningVotes.html#DH3">careful examination</a> in several kinds of Condorcet systems.
</blockquote>

<p>
Incidentally, some purists may quibble: why did the A-fan voters decide to exaggerate?
Well the C-fans felt forced to do so because, given that the A- and B-fans already chose
to exaggerate, the C-voters knew that C could not win without exaggeration.
But all three kinds of voters do not know what the others are going to do and how
many of them are going to do it (nor even how many of them there <i>are</i>),
and hence have to <i>guess</i>, and their guess is "most of those rotters are
probably going to exaggerate"!  So based on this guess, they feel they too must exaggerate to
get any chance of victory.  (And that feeling is <i>always</i> accurate in the sense that, if some
appropriate fraction of the opposing voters exaggerated, then [1]
our candidate would be sure
to lose to a rival, but [2] by such exaggeration we could regain the victory.)
</p>

<p>
The result of the new exaggerated votes is: D, the <i>worst</i> candidate
in the eyes of <i>all</i>, wins the election.  
Guaranteed.
As we said, this happens with the Borda system and also with every Condorcet method.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, with <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> the A voters will
exaggerate thus: A=99, B=C=D=0, and if everybody acts that way, then C
will (deservedly) be elected.  (There is <i>no</i> advantage a range voter gains by dishonestly
scoring 
D above B and C &ndash; this can't help A win versus B and/or C and simply incurs risk
that D will win.  But there <i>is</i> sometimes advantage for  Condorcet or Borda voters.)
C also wins with IRV and plurality.
This is an example of the fact that range voting is designed to exhibit
only a mild degradation in reaction to dishonestly-exaggerated "strategic voting."
With Condorcet and Borda, the allergic reaction is not mild: it is
"anaphylactic shock."
</p>

<p>
<b>How common is this?</b>
Very common &ndash; every situation with 3 near-equal good rivals and one or more other (less-good)
candidates is fodder for DH3.  I.e. whenever it is not merely essentially a 2-man race.
Here is 
<a href="rangeVborda.html#bossbulb">the (amusing?) story</a>
of how DH3 happened in the only serious-stakes ($100,000+) 
ranked-ballot vote I was ever involved in.  DH3-like phenomena were also 
<a href="rangeVborda.html#kiribati">immediately observed</a>
in the only government in the world (<a href="FunnyElections.html#kiri91">Kiribati</a>) 
that tried Borda voting.
