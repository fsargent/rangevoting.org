<H2> Ultrasonic nozzle &ndash; more cleaning with less water </H2>

<p>
Scientists from the UK have
developed a revolutionary ultrasonic attachment for taps, 
which massively enhances the ability of water to clean.
</p>
<p>Currently, industry uses excessive water, power and additives for cleaning. For example, it can take up to 100 tonnes of water to produce 1 tonne of clean wool after shearing. Many industrial processes also generate large quantities of contaminated run-off. The water from hosing down an abattoir represents a real health risk and cannot be allowed to enter the water supply. Purifying run-off is costly -- each cubic metre of water used for cleaning in the nuclear industry can cost around &pound;10,000 to subsequently treat.</p>
<p>Professor Tim Leighton and Dr Peter Birkin's device works with cold water, minimal additives and consumes as much electrical power as a light bulb. Its application will be wide -- licenses have already been sold to a number of industries to look at cleaning in food preparation, hospitals, manufacturing and the home. The new technology consumes less water and power than the established competitor technologies.</p>
<p>Talking about the need for such a technology, Professor Leighton says: &quot;Society runs on its ability to clean. Ineffective cleaning leads to food poisoning; failure of manufactured products such as precision watches and microchips; and poor construction -- from shipbuilding to space shuttles -- since dirty surfaces do not bond. The impact in healthcare is huge -- hospital-acquired infections, from instruments that aren't properly cleaned, cost the NHS &pound;1 billion per year. There's a very obvious need for technologies that improve our ability to clean while saving on our most important resources, water and energy.&quot;</p>
<p>In recognition of their invention, Professor Leighton and Dr Birkin were awarded the 
&pound;250,000
Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation 2011.</p>
<p>They plan to develop products based on an ultrasonic nozzle which can fit on the end of a tap or hose. The device uses less water and power than the equivalent pressure washer (approximately 2 litres/minute compared to 20 litres/minute and less than 200 W compared to 2kW). It is also far less damaging as the stream pressure is less that 1/100th that of a pressure washer,
and it works with unheated water.
