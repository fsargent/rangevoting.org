<p><b>Abstract.</b>
With confidence&asymp;99.7%,
the Romanian 2009 presidential election included the "Condorcet cycle"
Geoana&sup;Oprescu&sup;Basescu&sup;Geoana where "&sup;" means "majority-preferred."
B (followed by G) was the official winner.  Other cycles also may have occurred;
in all there is 99.9% confidence at least one existed that contained both B &amp; G.
With "<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>" 
(and probably also "<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>") Oprescu would have
been the most likely winner, even though he officially finished 6th.
This marks the first time a Condorcet Cycle has been detected high in
a large national election.
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction </h2>
<p>
It has been well known since the days of the 
Marquis de Condorcet (1743-1794)
&ndash;
and previously clearly had been
understood by Ramon Llull (1232-1315)
&ndash;
that <a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycles</a> can exist in elections.
That is, the preferences of the voters can be such that
every candidate has at least one rival preferred over him by a voter majority.
For example, consider this 19-voter election:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">

a "Condorcet cycle."

<td align="center">
C>A>B
</td>
</tr>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Should candidate B win?  One could argue "No, since
A is preferred over B by 11 out of 19 voters."
So should A win?
"No, since
C is preferred over A by 14 out of 19 voters."
So C must be the right winner?
"Still no, since
B is preferred over C by 13 out of 19 voters."
</p>

<p>
Condorcet cycles are tremendously important morally and philosophically since
they show that "naive majoritarianism" is logically untenable, since
self-contradictory.  That is, it is <i>untenable</i> to claim 
"if there are a finite number of choices and choice A is preferred by a voter majority 
over choice B, then A is 'better' than B."  The whole idea of "majority rule" therefore
seems to need to be discarded as a basis for "democracy."
Condorcet cycles also underlie, e.g. 
<a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a>
for rank-order-ballot voting systems.
</p>

<p>
This can be considered a good reason to prefer <i>non</i>-rank-order-ballot voting systems 
not afflicted by this kind of logical paradox, unaffected by Arrow's theorem, and
obeying a different (and now logically consistent) notion of "majority rule,"
e.g. <a href=https://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
</p>

<p>
All that was fine as a matter of abstract philosophy
&ndash; but in <i>"real world" elections</i>
Condorcet cycles  seem to be quite rare.   
</p><blockquote><small>
Although they seem to arise considerably more
frequently in <i>legislative votes</I> than in single-winner  public elections,
because legislators often strive to create them intentionally, e.g. they form the basis
for the "poison pill" legislative tactic.
Many examples have been documented in the writings of William H. Riker,
and see also <a href="KurrildKendnote3.txt">endnote 3</a>
of Kurrild-Klitsgaard 2001.
</small></blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, in the 750 years since Llull, apparently not a single Condorcet top-cycle
has ever been clearly documented in any large governmental election!
Which leads to the question: <i>how frequent are Condorcet cycles?</i>
Some attempted answers are in table 2.

<p>
This absence,
<!--of clearly documented Condorcet cycles in 750 years of
large public governmental elections,-->
however, does not necessarily prove
cycles rare.  They might have been quite common but merely escaped notice!
[Actually, all it proves is that Condorcet cycles <i>easily provable from the
usually-small subset of the full preference dataset that manages to become
publicly available</i>,
are rare.]
Why?  
Because in order to prove a Condorcet cycle exists in some election, you need to have either
<ol>
<li>
rank-order-ballots,
</li><li>
or extensive "A versus B" pairwise-preference polling.
</li></ol>
In fact, in the last 750 years, it is doubtful that
there have even been 100 major government
elections where 
it even was <i>possible to hope</i> to detect a Condorcet cycle.  In all the
other major government elections, the necessary
data simply was never collected, or never made public.  To explain that:
</p><p>
<b>1.</b> 
Elections with rank-order ballots are rare since almost all countries employ
"name one candidate" (<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-voting-style) ballots.
<!--And in almost every rank-order-ballot election in world history 
thousands have been conducted in-->
But in Ireland and Australia, the top two countries using
"single transferable vote" rank-order-ballot schemes) 
their governments have
<i>refused to publish</i> the ballot data and indeed refused even to publish
the table of pairwise-preference counts.  Instead, they merely publish
certain incomplete summaries of the ballots inadequate to reconstruct these things.
These countries also will not give this data to researchers who request it.
<!--at least not whenever I've tried over the last 5 years.-->
There have been about 3 experiments 
in which Ireland or Australia <i>did</i> publish a
full set of ballots, but in those few cases no Condorcet top-cycle arose.
</p><p>
<b>2.</b> 
In countries (and there are many)
which conduct two-round "plurality+top-two-runoff" presidential
elections, it has become common
for pre-election and/or exit-polling agencies to ask pairwise questions of the form
"if it comes down to a top-2-runoff between A and B, who would you vote for?"
<!--However, this practice has only become common in the last 20-30 years, seems not to
occur in Australia and Ireland, and only tends to occur
in especially important elections such as national presidential.-->
But it only becomes possible to 
see a Condorcet cycle if
these questions are asked for enough candidate-pairs (A,B).  
And usually they are not.
</p><p>
Our purpose here is to report the first ever observation (via the second method) of
a Condorcet cycle high in an important government election: 
namely in the 2009 Romanian presidential election.   
</p><blockquote><small>
I detected this cycle
about 30 seconds after the official results were announced early in the morning of
Monday 7 Dec 2009 Romanian time, 
and had been eagerly awaiting and expecting its appearance for about 5 hours.
</small></blockquote>
<!-- 
Unfortunately the situation is not quite
as clearcut as I originally thought it was going to 
be; for why, see 
<a href="#polls">section 3 on polls</a>.

<b>Remark:</b>
After writing this paper, I found the paper by Kurrild-Klitgaard 2001 
presenting evidence for another Condorcet cycle in a poll of 
Danish voter preferences for their prime minister.  That
was not, however, a real election, since the Danish PM is not directly elected by the people.

<b>Comments:</b>
The "totals"
given by the <a href="http://www.bec2009p.ro/rezultate.html">Biroul</a>
are not exactly equal to the column sums.  <!--I do not know what they are.-->
Also 50.33+49.66=99.99&ne;100, which is another error made by the Biroul.
<!--which I merely repeat here.-->
Geoana contested his loss in constitutional court,
<a href="RomaniaFraud2.html">accusing</a> Basescu of electoral fraud.
On 11 December the court decided to recount all 138476 invalid votes.
This recount actually slightly increased Basescu's lead
(it found 2247 ballots actually <i>were</i> valid,
1260 for Basescu and 987 for Geoana).
On December 14 the court
declared Basescu the victor, and Geoana conceded
defeat.
<!--
http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE5BD25V20091214

-->
</p><blockquote><small>
There is <a href="RomaniaFraud1.txt">evidence</a>
that some fraud occurred, although it does not amount to a large quantity; Geoana
suggests those with more evidence send it to <tt>fraudarealegeri2009@gmail.com</tt>.
I personally am convinced based on exit polls that
the fraud, if any, was small in percentage terms
&ndash; but unfortunately, only a small fraud was needed.
</small></blockquote><p>
<a href="rangeVirv.html">'Instant' runoff (IRV)</a>
would immediately have eliminated everybody except Basescu, Geoana, and Antonescu
(since the sum of all their top-preference votes failed to exceed Antonescu's 20.02%).
However, it is not obvious whom IRV would have eliminated next.
<a href="Asset.html">Asset voting</a> would presumably have elected Geoana since &ndash;
somewhat unexpectedly &ndash;
Antonescu, Marko, and Becali all endorsed Geoana in the G vs B runoff.
(Antonescu called Geoana the "lesser evil" and denounced Basescu as a
"demagogue and a populist." Oprescu also argued Geoana was the lesser evil, but
refused to fall into the trap of [therefore] endorsing him, since in Oprescu's view both G and B
were "false Romanians.")
Evidently, though,  Romania's voters were mostly unmoved by those endorsements.

<h2>3. Pairwise Polls </h2>
<p>
The principal pollsters and their pairwise-style pre-election polls are reported
in the following tables.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the media simply invented some fake "results" for "polls"
which never actually happened.  E.g. CURS and CCSB both
posted warnings on their web pages about that.
Multiple media coverage of the same "poll" does not necessarily prove that poll existed since 
different media outlets copy each other.
It is preferable to check primary sources 
(i.e. the polling firms) in all cases and distrust media accounts &ndash;
or at least, only
rely on the media which actually sponsored that poll!
Unfortunately, I have not always been able to do that, but I have done it
for all the polls in the most important and critical tables 7, 9, and 11, the online
polls, and the Gallup polls in &sect;5.

<b>Comments:</b>
Sometimes pollsters conduct and publicize polls without being paid for it by anybody,
for public relations, self-calibration, and/or advertising purposes.
</p><blockquote><small>
Some Romanian conspiracy-theorist bloggers and media have insinuated that
INSOMAR is supported by 
Sorin Ovidiu Vantu (the "media mogul" who owns Realitatea TV and who was linked
with Geoana) while CCSB is 67% owned by
Camelia Voiculescu, the daughter of another media "mogul" whom Basescu also accused 
(during a G-vs-B debate)
of associations with Geoana and a founder of the PC 
&ndash; and therefore, their polls should not be
trusted.  (And indeed, the CCSB and INSOMAR polls comparing Geoana versus Basescu were
the ones with the most outrageous pro-Geoana errors, while Gallup, CURS, and 
CSOP basically got correct answers.)
Fortunately, the reader may verify that even if all CCSB and INSOMAR polls are discarded 
from our dataset, the main conclusions of this paper will not be greatly affected.
<br><br>
The problem in a nutshell is this:
there are <i>two</i> different voter-populations (a) the voters in the official B-vs-G runoff
and (b) the pollsters' attempts to get representative samples (with different pollsters
using different techniques).
Our statistical analyses will all be predicated on the assumption that (a) and (b)
are the same.   But at least in the case of the largest INSOMAR polls, table 5
indicates differences existed.
<br><br>
The usual patter about why such conspiracy theories are dubious
is that pollsters are very motivated by market forces
&ndash; <i>especially</i> in the case of publicly-released "showcase" 
polls like these &ndash; against delivering wrong/inaccurate answers; and
further, there is little motivation to fake poll results anyhow
(since, e.g, there is no logical reason why a poll wrongly predicting a Geoana victory,
would motivate anybody to vote Geoana in a G-vs-B election).
Indeed, I would expect that CCSB and INSOMAR will now be punished by
having fewer market research 
customers.
<!--  However, it remains possible my "usual thinking" is naive. -->
</small></blockquote>
</p><p>
The fact that, in some cases, different polls disagreed, means 
that anybody aware of only a subset of those polls, risks being deluded.

<b>Comments:</b>
The polls in table 5 are unnecessary for the purposes of this paper,
since they all are trumped by the official runoff election count, which is allegedly exact.
We give this table purely as a <i>check</i> on the non-fraudulence of the official count or on the 
abilities of the pollsters. <!--(whichever way you prefer to interpret it).-->
The CURS, CSOP, and Gallup polls got the right answer.
The two large INSOMAR polls at the end both were far outside their expected margins of
error, suggesting either (a) election fraud by Basescu, or (b) some kind
of sampling bias by the pollsters relative to the true voter distribution, or (c)
the pollsters lied.
Probably the reason is mostly (b) because 4 <i>exit</i> polls 
of the runoff (which presumably has greatly reduced biased-sampling problems)
found: INSOMAR 48.8%, CSOP 50.4%, CURS 49.3%, CCSB 49% respectively for Basescu.
These exit polls overall still wrongly predicted a Geoana victory, but much less
dramatically than the pre-election polls, indeed their errors seem within
the margin of error; and Basescu claims his victory was due to the 146876 valid votes from
Romanian voters residing in <i>foreign</i>
countries (who voted in B's favor about 78.9% and presumably were never polled).
Note that Basescu's official winning margin over Geoana from table 3 was 70048 votes
(0.66%);
and without the foreign voters, B actually would have <i>lost</i> to Geoana
by 14738 votes (0.14%).

<b>Comments:</b>
<i>If</i> the samples were independent and from the correct voter distribution,
and <i>if</i> we were allowed to ignore the annoying rounding of the pollsters' figures,
then, based on the polls after mid-october,
the confidence Antonescu was genuinely majority-preferred over Basescu would be
over 5.5&sigma;,  <a href="NHack.html">that is</a>
over 99.999998% confidence. 
By the use of "optimally weighted stratified sampling" techniques 
(see <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p101">CRV Puzzle #101</a>; at least some pollsters, 
e.g. Gallup, have claimed they employ these techniques)
pollsters should achieve error bars actually <i>below</i> the Bernoulli variance
formula we are employing,
therefore our conclusions <i>ought</i> to be valid.
</p><blockquote><small>
According to Bernoulli,
given N pollees a fraction p of whom answer "yes" and q=1-p of whom answer "no,"
the estimated mean-yes fraction in the larger universe is p and the estimated variance
in that estimate is &sigma;&sup2;=pq/N.  
Concerning the value of N, note that in 14 poll-questions
mentioned in this paper whose response rates were provided by the  pollster,
the mean response rate was 64%.  Therefore I employ N=0.64T
where T is the total number of pollees, as my estimate of N for polls where the pollster
did <i>not</i> inform us of the response rate.
</small></blockquote><p>
However, the poor performance of some of the pollsters 
in table 5 at predicting the official runoff result
contradicts that and casts some doubt on their expertise and on all our conclusions.
</p>
<blockquote><small>
Indeed, the B-vs-G polls tabulated after mid-October would 
have yielded about 10&sigma; "confidence" of a majority-preference for G over B.
The official count actually <i>found</i> 
a slight G&gt;B majority among the <i>non-foreign</i> (i.e the polled)
Romanian voters &ndash; Basescu won due to foreign voters &ndash; but 
the polls found about 9.6&sigma; "confidence" it should have been larger than it was.

<i>If</i> the samples were independent and from the correct voter distribution,
and <i>if</i> we were allowed to ignore the annoying rounding of the pollsters' figures,
then, based on the above 3 polls,
we get about 0.5&sigma; confidence that Antonescu was
majority-preferred over Geoana,
<a href="NHack.html">which is</a>
only 70% confidence.
On the other hand if we <i>only</i> 
employ the November polls (which both were available rounded to 
&plusmn;0.05% accuracy, unlike the CURS poll) then it is Geoana who wins, albeit
with  only 56% confidence.  We shall do the latter.
The habit of pollsters of rounding to the nearest integer
percent may be naively appealing (if, say, their error bar is &plusmn;2.6%)
but is a <i>very bad practice</i> since it severely handicaps efforts to compute
confidence values or to combine data from different polls. CURS did not
respond to requests for more accurate data.

<p>
These polls obviously cannot be taken seriously because they both were from extremely
unrepresentative, pro-Antonescu biased, samples which would have
Antonescu defeating all rivals (except perhaps Cernea!)
by huge margins, e.g. in the first poll defeating Basescu pairwise by 88.6% to 11.4%.
However, it is perhaps of interest that Antonescu would according to
the first poll defeat Oprescu by smaller margins than those by which either O or A
defeated Basescu.
In the second poll, Antonescu defeats Oprescu by a smaller margin than he defeats
Geoana (albeit by a slightly larger margin than his defeat of Basescu).
These facts suggest that in an <i>unbiased</i> sample, Oprescu might defeat
Antonescu.  This same speculation also is supported by Gallup's approval-voting-style 
poll discussed in our <a href="#apprv">&sect;5</a>.
Therefore we shall estimate (because this is the estimate arising from the Gallup approval poll)
that Oprescu would win a matchup against
Antonescu with probability 89%.  Observe that in that poll (restricting attention to
the 72-73% pollees who provided a response) at least 1.55% approved Oprescu but not
Antonescu, and at least 1.55% disapproved A but not O.   Hence 
in a pairwise A-vs-O contest, we suspect that
O would win by at least (as our mean estimate of a lower bound)
51.55-to-48.44%.

<p><b>What about the foreign voters?</b>
Foreign voters boosted Basescu's margin over Geoana by 0.80% 
(from -0.14% to +0.66%).
According to
Alina Mungiu-Pippidi 
(Democracy Studies Chair at
Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, and a Romanian)
expatriate Romanians automatically vote heavily
against parties linked to the old communist regime,
which in this case means they automatically vote against Geoana.  
However, this presumably would not have motivated voting against either Antonescu or Oprescu.
A different theory about the expatriates is that many live in Moldova, and since
Basescu has loudly championed the right of Moldovan Romanians to get Romanian citizenship,
they support Basescu.   
Presumably <i>that</i> motivation to vote for Basescu <i>would</i> still apply.
<i>If</i> one guesses (which we shall not) that the same
boost would have occurred for Basescu versus either Antonescu or Oprescu, then
that would have diminished the Ant&sup;Bas vote from 52.07% to 51.67%
and decreased the confidence of the "&sup;" to 4.5&sigma; (99.9997%);
and it would have diminished the
Opr&sup;Bas margin from 51.76% to 51.36% 
and diminished the confidence to 2.43&sigma; (99.25%).
This is not enough diminishment to hurt the main conclusion
of this paper, i.e. that a B&amp;G-containing cycle existed with confidence&asymp;99.9%.
</p>

<p><b>Cycle analysis:</b>
Two possible Condorcet 3-Cycles are
</p>
<center>
Cycle #1: &nbsp;&nbsp; 
A&sup;B&sup;G&sup;A
</center>
<center>
Cycle #2: &nbsp;&nbsp; 
O&sup;B&sup;G&sup;O
</center>
<p>
where "&sup;" means "is preferred by a voter majority over."
Let P<sub>k</sub> for k=1,2 denote our statistical confidence levels
that cycle #k genuinely existed.
We claim

<center>
P<sub>1</sub> &asymp; 0.56 &asymp; 0.99999998 &times; 1 &times; 0.56
, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
P<sub>2</sub> &asymp; 0.9971 &asymp; 0.9992 &times; 1 &times; 0.9979.
</center>
<p>
From this we conclude with confidence <b>99.87%</b> that at least one of these two cycles
genuinely exists, i.e. with confidence 99.87% the official winner Basescu,
and the official runner-up Geoana, both were
members of at least one of these two cycles.   
Also there are additional possible cycles (such as B&sup;G&sup;O&sup;A&sup;B,
which has estimated 89% chance of being genuine, almost independently
of P<sub>1</sub>), which pushes
the probability of at least one G&amp;B-containing cycle really existing up 
<b>over 99.9%</b>.
</p><p>
To be precise about this, the exact formula (got by writing it
as a sum of 64
monomial terms, each a product of 6 probabilities and
expressing the probability of a directed-graph configuration

With the P<sub>XY</sub> in table 10b this yields <b>Prob(BGcycle)=99.904%</b>;
and even if we instead use the decreased values
P<sub>AB</sub>=99.9997% and P<sub>OB</sub>=99.25% 
due to a postulated foreign pro-Basescu vote, we still get 
Prob(BGcycle)=99.871%.
It's important to realize that <i>despite</i> the unclarity about the pairs A-vs-O and
A-vs-G, we still get high confidence of cycles, mainly
because the leading cycle candidate
O&sup;B&sup;G&sup;O
does not involve either unclear pair.
</p><p>
The confidence that no Condorcet winner existed is at least 56%.
Almost all of the remaining 44% probability would represent the chance that Antonescu was
really the Condorcet winner.   However, that estimate of "44%" is ignoring the possibility that
Antonescu would lose in a head-to-head comparison with Oprescu.
Although I am unaware of any 
reputable polling  directly
addressing that question,
from the online polls corrected to remove pro-Antonescu bias, and also from the 
Gallup approval-style <a href="#apprv">poll</a>,
it appears that Oprescu would have 89%
chances in an A-vs-O matchup.  (There also is a small chance
Antonescu might also lose pairwise versus any
of the other candidates such as Tudor, Kelemen, etc.)
In view of this, we reduce this 44% chance to 
5%&asymp;P<sub>AO</sub>P<sub>AG</sub>P<sub>AB</sub>.  
(More precisely, we find a 5.02% chance that a Condorcet winner exists, in which case there is
96% chance it is Antonescu, 4% chance it is Oprescu, and negligible chance it is anybody else.
P<sub>AO</sub>P<sub>AG</sub>P<sub>AB</sub> is the exact probability it is Antonescu,
P<sub>OA</sub>P<sub>OG</sub>P<sub>OB</sub> is the exact probability it is Oprescu,
[among [A,B,G,O}],
etc. and these probabilities may be added since they represent <i>disjoint</i> events.)
So our final estimate of the chance 
that no Condorcet winner existed is <b>95%.</b>

<a name="Laatu"></a>
<p><b>What sort of Condorcet cycles were these? "Laatu types":</b>
Juho Laatu (after reading an earlier draft of this paper)
proposed classifying Condorcet cycles in large elections into three types:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>I.
"Weak" cycle (aka random cycle or noise-generated cycle):</b>
</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
the looped candidates are almost tied
</li><li>
can be a result of some almost random variation in the votes
</li><li>
one could say that this kind of a loop is one special version of a tie
</li><li>
any of the looped candidates could be the winner (with no big violation
of any of the majority opinions)
against any
</li><li>
the expected winner may change from day to day in the polls
</li></ul></dd>
<dt><b>II.
"Strong" cycle (stable cycle, rational cycle, cycle with a stable identifiable reason):</b>
</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
there is some specific, in principle describable,
<i>reason</i> that has led to the formation of this
loop (not random variation in the votes)
</li><li>
the cycle / opinions are strong enough to that they are unaffected by
daily/weekly random opinion fluctuations 
</li></ul></dd>
<dt><b>III.
"Strategic" cycle:</b>
</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
artificially generated by strategies employed by some voters to
"game the election"
</li><li>
not based on sincere opinions
</li></ul></dd></dl>
<!--Strong cycles are more
interesting than weak ones
since [they have] some specific reason behind them and the opinion is stable and clear.
[I believe] there are such situations but [that] they are uncommon in real life.-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Which kind of cycle do we have here in Romania 2009?
I do not believe the O&sup;B&sup;G&sup;O cycle is "weak" and "noise-generated"
because, if the votes were just the results of 10<sup>7</sup>
voters tossing independent identical coins we would expect margins
(and "noise levels") of order &plusmn;3162 votes, i.e. &plusmn;0.03%.
The vote-margins in this cycle instead were about
3.5%, 0.66%, and 7.7% respectively &ndash; far larger. 
I believe this cycle was stable from day to day and there were some
underlying rational reasons behind it.
Indeed, <i>any</i> cycle detected via <i>polls</i> rather than exact vote counts
will necessarily (if its detection is statistically significant) not be "weak"
in Laatu's sense.
</p><p>
It also seems not "strategic" since its pairwise claims are based
on <i>2-choice</i> polls and elections, in which it is difficult or
impossible to see any strategic reason for the pollees/voters to be
dishonest.  
</p><blockquote><small>
On the other hand, obviously the huge distortions in the official
round-1 plurality-counts away from the underlying truth, were mostly caused by
strategic decisions by voters arising because of the well-known flaws in
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> as a voting method.  With the plurality+top2
method employed, voting for anybody not perceived to be in the "leading three"
in terms of election chances, was a "wasted vote."   When the decision was made (almost
certainly as part of a deal between the major political parties and media moguls) 
that only Antonescu, Basescu, and Geoana
would be allowed to participate in a widely publicized and televised debate, they
immediately became the leading three, <i>regardless</i> of whether
anybody else was felt by Romania to be a superior candidate, and Oprescu's doom
was sealed.  Then:
Because Basescu had a large lead in plurality-style polls going into round 1
(but clearly not large enough to get a majority and thus avoid the runoff)
while (pairwise poll data showed) 
Antonescu was more likely than Geoana to defeat him in the runoff,
it became strategically the smart move for many Basescu supporters to vote for
Geoana in the first round, <i>even if they honestly felt Geoana was the worst candidate</i>.
Meanwhile, anti-Basescu voters would have been motivated to vote Antonescu, even
if they honestly preferred Geoana.
</small></blockquote>
<p>
Therefore, the cycle was "strong" (Laatu type II).
Nevertheless, it was not <i>very</i> "strong," since
0.66%, 3.5%, and 7.7% represent small to moderate margins.
</p><p>
All of Laatu's three types do occur:
Bochsler 2008 found a preference cycle
<pre>
     {P or A}&sup;S    by 109812 to 102796    (51.6% majority)
            S&sup;P    by 106832 to 104144    (50.6% majority)
            P&sup;A    by 106863 to 101586    (51.1% majority)
</pre>
in a 3-choice referendum about changing a law about state employees
held on 28 November 2004 in the Swiss Canton of Bern.
(This election was held using unusual "decision tree" style ballots, which
was the reason the cycle was detectable.)
Bochsler in his paper explained the reasons he believed
this cycle was Laatu type III, i.e. was mostly caused by "strategic voters"
trying to "game" the decision-tree election.  
</p><p>
Kurrild-Klitsgaard 2001 found a cycle 
<pre>
     E&sup;J   by 50.6% majority    among the 77% respondents among the 1169 pollees
     J&sup;R   by 51.1% majority    among the 92% respondents among the 1169 pollees
     R&sup;E   by 52.8% majority    among the 89% respondents among the 1169 pollees
</pre>
among the three candidates {Hans <b>E</b>ngell, Uffe Ellemann-<b>J</b>ensen,
and Poul Nyrup <b>R</b>asmussen} for Danish Prime Minister in mid-May 1994.
Note that (a) the Danish PM is not elected by the people, hence this poll had nothing to do
with any real election, (b) the &plusmn;1&sigma; margin of error for this poll was 
&plusmn;(15-16) votes,
i.e. &plusmn;(1.52% to 1.67%),
so that the statistical confidences that these "majority" preferences
genuinely existed, were respectively 64%, 76%, and 96%.
This is of course laughable for the purpose of drawing any conclusion about the 
"reality" of this cycle in the Danish electorate.  But it <i>is</i> legitimate to remark
that among these 1169 pollees <i>alone</i> there was a cycle.  But if so, there is
no evidence it was not merely "noise-generated," i.e. of Laatu type I.  Similarly, in
the June 2008 election by the 
Wikimedia Foundation to fill a vacant seat on its Board of
Trustees (Schulze's beatpath
Condorcet method with rank-order ballots was employed), 
there were 15 candidates, about 26000 eligible
voters, and 3019 valid ballots. 
Ting Chen was the clear Condorcet
winner hence won the seat, but there was a cyclic tie for sixth
to ninth position between J.Heiskanen, R.Postlethwaite, S.Smith, and
R.Saintonge: JH&sup;RP&sup;SS&sup;RS&sup;JH.
However <!--, this was not a <i>government</i> election and -->
<i>reversing only 5
pair-preferences
on ballots would have eliminated the cycle.</i>
Thus, again, there was no evidence this cycle was not
"noise generated," i.e. Laatu type I.
</p><p>
<b><i>What were</i> the underlying rational reasons behind our
cycles?</b>
That is very difficult to ascertain
(or even merely to verify), especially for a foreigner like me unfamiliar with the
Romanian language.  <!--(And even if some oracle were to <i>tell</i> me the reasons, it
would be almost impossible for me to confirm their correctness.)-->
But it is not hard to invent a plausible-sounding story "explaining" a cycle.
There is a comparative sketch of
the candidates here: 
<a href="Romania2009MainCanddts.txt">/Romania2009MainCanddts.txt</a>.
Consider these three issue-sets (call them
T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>):
</p><ol><li>
Foreign relations &amp; diplomacy.  Pensions and unemployment benefits.
</li><li>
Accusations of corruption and cozy relations with media moguls &amp;
wealthy businessmen; worries about trampling constitutional limits on power;
best for hospitals &amp; schools; feeling that 
Romania's current leaders doing poor job so need a change.
</li><li>
Desires to cut government size and budget;
racist preferences for Christianity over Islam; 
Moldovans who want an easy path to Romanian citizenship;
expatriate Romanians who automatically vote against parties linked to the old communist regime.
</li></ol>
<p>
Voters caring mostly about
T<sub>1</sub> would have preference order  G>B>O.
Voters caring mostly about
T<sub>2</sub> would have preference order  O>G>B.
Finally, voters caring mostly about
T<sub>3</sub> might have preference order  B>O>G
and apparently B was felt to have won his final debate with G.
</p>
<p>
If these three kinds of voters were roughly equinumerous, that would produce
an O&sup;B&sup;G&sup;O cycle.  I do not claim this is the right, true,
or only explanation; I merely say it is one possible hypothesis.

<h2>5. Approval- and range-voting style polls </h2>

<p>
Gallup Romania during 5-8 November
conducted both an <a href="Approval.html">Approval-voting</a>-style poll 
and a <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality-voting</a>-style poll (1253
adults [age&ge;18] representative of the Romanian voter population; "stratified sampling"
techniques used; face-to-face interviews at their homes),
and the two graphics (provided by Gallup) give the results.
</p>
<img src="Gallup58Nov09app.png" width="49%">
<img src="Gallup58Nov09plur.png" width="49%">
<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
Oprescu and Antonescu are clearly ahead of everybody else in the approval-style
poll. Oprescu had
more approvals than any rival <i>despite</i> having the fewest (only 72%) pollees 
giving an opinion about him; and Oprescu also had the fewest disapprovals even 
<i>after</i> rescaling to discard all no-opinion votes.   
Antonescu is second, and Geoana third; all others are statistically-significantly behind,
i.e. they would all lose with confidence exceeding 99.9%.
To assess this more precisely,
I did a Monte Carlo calculation.  It indicated that the Gallup data predicts
that, with confidence&asymp;89.5%, 
Oprescu would defeat Antonescu in an approval-voting election;
and with confidence&asymp;99.4%
Oprescu would defeat Geoana.
</p>
<!--
The Monte Carlo code:
with(stats):
ctA := 0; ctG := 0;
for i from 1 to 10000 do
   OprA := 40*100/72 + stats[random, normald]() * 1.191;
   OprD := 100.0 - OprA;
   AntA := 39*100/73 + stats[random, normald]() * 1.204;
   AntD := 100.0 - AntA;
   if( OprA*AntD > AntA*OprD ) then ctA := ctA+1; fi;
   GeoA := 39*100/76 + stats[random, normald]() * 1.231;
   GeoD := 100.0 - GeoA;
   if( OprA*GeoD > GeoA*OprD ) then ctG := ctG+1; fi;
od;
print("Opr beats Ant with prob=", ctA/100.0, "percent.");
print("Opr beats Geo with prob=", ctG/100.0, "percent.");
#Ant:  89.85, 89.00, 89.65
#Geo:  99.46, 99.35, 99.25
-->
<p>
But with <i>plurality</i> voting the poll predicts Basescu wins 
(also with confidence&gt;99.9%), which, of course, indeed happened in round 1.
Observe that switching from approval to plurality voting <i>swaps</i> the
fourth and first place finishers Oprescu and Basescu.
I.e, Oprescu comes top and Basescu bottom among {A,B,G,O}
in the approval-voting poll, exactly the opposite of the official results
using plurality + top-2-runoff voting.

However, a

asked a range-voting-like question "How much do you trust politician X?"
("Cata incredere aveti in X?") for many different X on an 0-100 trust scale.   
The most-trusted
among the presidential candidates again was found to be Oprescu (37%).
Oprescu had also been the most-trusted (48%) in an earlier (18-25 Sept) IOP poll

<b>Other remarks:</b>
The polls I examined revealed no sign of a "gender gap."
But there was an "age gap" with older voters favoring Geoana and younger ones Basescu.

<h2>6. Conclusions</h2>
<ol><li>
The 2009 Romanian Presidential Election probably exhibited 
two or more different
<a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycles</a>.  
I find about 99.9% confidence (assuming 
valid polls) that both of the
top two official finishers Geoana &amp; Basescu were members of at 
least one cycle.   
</li><li>
There either was no Condorcet winner (95% confidence) or it was the official third-placer
Antonescu (4.8%) or 6th-placer Oprescu (0.2%).
</li><li>
The official plurality+top2runoff (2 round) method used, elected 
Basescu who would have lost head-to-head versus either O or A by 
comparatively clear margins; B did beat G pairwise but only by an
0.66% margin.  So, <i>based on the pairwise table alone</i>, B overall was 
probably the worst choice among {A,B,G,O}, but was elected; while A or O were
probably the best choices, but finished third and sixth, respectively,
in the official count.
</li><li>
The truth was this was a close 4-way race between {O, A, G, B} 
but the 
election method distorted that hugely and made it look like (and effectively be)
a 2-way race  between G &amp; B, with O &amp; A far behind.
</li><li>
The only <a href="Approval.html">approval-voting</a>-style 
poll I have found says if it had 
been approval voting 
then O, A, and G all would have placed clearly ahead of B.  So again, the 
official winner B appears to have been the worst choice. The approval 
poll, and also two <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>-like 
"trust level" polls, all gave the top spot to O 
<!-- (but not by a statistically significant margin over A and G?),  -->
despite the fact that Oprescu
officially finished last among these four (and 6th overall) with only 
3% of the vote. 
So approval and the officially-employed plurality+top2runoff method
featured <i>reversed</i> results for the top 
and bottom candidates among these 4. 
</li><li>
With 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting (IRV)</a>,
one of {A,B,G} would have won, but it is unclear who.
With 
<a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>, presumably Geoana would have won.
I thank Ronald Rivest for informing me that (with the central estimates of the pairwise margins
in table 10a) under both Borda Count and Schulze's "beatpath" Condorcet method, 
Geoana would have won.

http://mariusmina.blogspot.com/2009/11/sondaj-gallup-geoana-cade-sub-crin.html  
nov9 rept of 5-8 nov poll of 1253 rep've adults. Age thresh=18. Stratified sampling I think.
Plur: B=32, A=23, G=22, O=11, T=5.5, Becali=4, H=2.5. (76% responded, this is slide 8)
B-v-O 45-55
B-v-A 46-54
B-v-G 50-50
O 40 opinii pozitive, actually it says "opinie favorabila" or "nefavorabila." 
A 39 opinii pozitive
G 39 opinii pozitive
B 35 opinii pozitive (but the other multicnddt slide says 37) 53 dezaproba, 12 did not say
Bec 28 opinii pozitive
T 22 opinii pozitive
H not-asked. 
Ok, actually, Gallup gives a new slide 13 with all canddts and also with both + and -:
O 40+, 32-, 6+22=28 not saying
A 39+, 34-, 7+20=27 x
G 39+, 37-, 5+19=24 x
B 37+, 49-, 3+11=14 x
Bec 28+, 50-, 4+18=22 x
T 22+, 55-, 4+19=23 x
H not-asked.
