Range Voting strategy, and DYN, a proposed new voting method
</h2>
<p><small> by Forest W. Simmons (PhD) </small></p>

<h3> Part I. </h3>
<p>
Suppose that an election is being conducted under 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>
and that
you want to maximize the probability that your ballot will improve the
outcome of the election, i.e. the probability that your ballot will be
"positively pivotal."
</p><p>
If this is your goal, then your optimal strategy requires you to rate
all of the candidates at the two extremes of the range.
</p><p>
At which extreme should candidate X be rated? To answer that question,
first answer this one:
</p>
<blockquote>
If X were to be tied for the highest average rating, would it be 
<i>more likely</i>
for X to be tied with a <i>worse</i> candidate or with a <i>better</i>
candidate?
</blockquote>
<p>
If worse, then give X the maximum rating. If better, then give X the
minimum rating.  <br><small>
[Actually, this decision should really be based on <i>expected utility,</i>
but this point will not matter for our purposes.]</small>
</p><p>
With this type of strategy the intermediate ratings are superfluous.
</p><p>
If all voters are planning to use this kind of strategy, then the ballot
can be vastly simplified by using a two-value range, say YES versus NO.
Then we just have <a href="Approval.html">Approval Voting</a>.
</p><p>
The trouble with Approval Voting is that optimal Approval strategies
depend heavily on knowing the probabilities of wins and ties for the various
candidates as in the strategy discussed above.
</p><p>
These probabilities are hard to estimate, and it's easy for evil corporate
media-masters to <i>distort</i> those estimates, thus biasing everybody's strategizing,
thus biasing the voting, thus getting whomever they want elected, thus
bypassing democracy.
</p><p>
What is the solution?
</p><p>
A variation of Approval called <b>DYN</b> (for "Delegable Yes/No"), which I will
explain in Part II.
</p>
<p>
(Take a break.)
</p>

<h3> Part II. </h3>

<p>
In part I above we had good and bad news for Range voters:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Good news:</b></dt>
<dd>
To maximize the probability that your Range
ballot will improve the outcome of an election (relative to the outcome
without your ballot), you only need to vote at the range extremes. If
all Range voters want to do this, then a simple Yes/No approval style
ballot suffices.
<br><br>
Furthermore, under Range and Approval it can never hurt to rate your
favorite candidate at the positive extreme. This last advantage is <i>not</i>
shared by Borda, by any Condorcet method, or by any sequential
elimination method, like IRV. In all of those other methods it can
actually hurt you to rank your favorite candidate top
in crucial cases that arise with non-vanishing likelihood.
</dd>
<dt><b>Bad news:</b></dt>
<dd>
Disinformation about winning probabilities can
easily thwart optimal Approval strategy (and therefore, Range Voting
strategy). In other words, like strategic voters in all of the other
well known methods, Range/Approval voters are (to at least some degree) subject to
manipulation by disinformation from pollsters.
</dd>
<p>
The simplest solution to this problem that doesn't compromise the
"always give maximum support to favorite" advantage that Approval and
Range share over the other common methods is a variant of Approval known
as <b>DYN</b>, which stands for Delegable Yes/No:
</p>
<table  bgcolor="yellow"><tr><td>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter marks "YES" next to all of the names on the ballot that she
is sure that she wants to rate at the positive extreme, and "NO" next to
all of the names that she is sure she wants to rate at the negative
extreme.  She also may leave some candidates <i>blank</i> (neither YES nor NO).
</li><li>
Then she circles the name of a candidate (presumably her favorite) to
act on her behalf with regard to her unmarked choices. [If she does not
so designate any candidate, then any unmarked names will default to
"NO."] She has been given to understand that her designated candidate
will make the delegated decisions after all of the ballot sub-totals
have been made public.
</li><li>
All the votes are totaled.  At this point, there is some known number
of YES votes for each candidate.
But wait &ndash; there is more.
Say it is a C-candidate election.
Each candidate <i>also</i> has C-1 "bank accounts" (one for each of his rivals)
consisting of blank votes <i>under his control</i> for that rival.   
If candidate "Lincoln" has 57 votes in his
bank account for rival "Douglas" then he is now free to label those votes
as either "YES" or "NO" for Douglas.
</li><li>
After all the candidates have thus-labeled their delegated-votes, 
whoever <i>now</i> has the most YES votes, wins.
</li>
</ol>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
<b>Advantage: Unmanipulable by evil pollsters:</b>
The results available at stage 3
(e.g. proxy tallies, already-decided Yes/No tallies, 
relevant correlation coefficients, etc.) serve as a
reliable statistical basis for candidates (with help from trusted
technical advisers) to carry out their proxy obligations.
They won't have to (or want to) rely on guessy
poll results because with this information, they've got the ultimate truth.  
This will greatly
mitigate (if not totally nullify) the effects of any disinformation
spread by (official or unofficial) pollsters.
</p><p>
DYN can be viewed as a variant of approval voting.
And as with plain approval, approving your favorite can never hurt.
</p><p>
DYN has another <b>advantage</b> over plain Approval and
Range. By designating your favorite candidate to complete the Yes/No
decisions that you are unsure about (and/or that you don't care about)
you are able to express unique confidence in your favorite candidate
above and beyond the other candidates that you have supported with a
rating at the positive extreme.
</p><p>
That gives both moral support and extra decision power to
your favorite candidate.
</p><p>
Even if your favorite candidate does not have sufficient support to be
elected himself, there is a chance that the proxy power (to which you
contributed) will give him enough political leverage to improve the
outcome of the election over what it would have been otherwise.
</p><p>
This completes Part II of my explanation of the main rationale for the
creation of DYN from the point of view of a Range/Approval fan.
If you <i>weren't</i> a "Range/Approval fan" then read part III.
</p>

<h3> Part III. </h3>

<p>
To take this to the general public, I would place more emphasis on the
<i>ease</i> of DYN voting as compared to ranking the candidates.
Yes/No is easy &ndash;
and the fact you can "pass the buck" on any candidates you are unsure about, 
makes it even easier.  Meanwhile, ranking every candidate in order, is not easy.
</p><p>
I'd also give
more emphasis to the importance of the Favorite Betrayal Criterion (FBC), 
which is <a href="TarrIrv.html">failed</a>
by IRV, <a href="VenzSimp.html">Condorcet</a> (with or without ranking-equalities permitted)
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">Borda</a>, etc.
</p><p>
(On the downside, a disadvantage of DYN is that it is more complicated to count
than plain approval voting
and hence can't be done with <a href="VMSumm.html">dumb voting machines</a>.)
<!--
Or can it?  Actually, if each candidate X is viewed artificially as a 3-"candidate"
plurality election between "Xyes", "Xno", and "Xblank" then a dumb-plurality 
machine could tabulate?  Well no, you'd need quadratic # stuff. -->
</p><p>
Why do we <i>want</i> a new voting method? So we can give maximum support to our
favorite candidate without risking turning her into a 
"<a href="Glossary.html#spoiler">spoiler</a>."
Since 
simple methods that satisfy this FBC requirement are known, no complicated method
that fails it can be acceptable.
</p><p>
Besides Range and Approval none of the well-known methods satisfy 
FBC except a method called MMPO (MinMaxPairwiseOpposition) and certain
versions of Bucklin, all of which require strategy similar to approval
strategy, based on the same type of poll-based information. That leads to the
same worries about evil media-masters feeding us disinformation.
So we are led
inexorably back to DYN.
</p><p>
For  <!--<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>-->
<a href="CFERlet.html">IRV</a>
supporters who think that IRV comes close enough to satisfying
the FBC (even though it doesn't), our best ammunition is in the form of
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">Yee-Bolson diagrams</a>. 
These diagrams, more than anything else, have
convinced my Liberal Arts Math students that IRV is inferior to Approval
and Condorcet methods, and not much of an improvement on Plurality for
getting third parties into the running.
</p><p>
The only problem with Yee-Bolson diagrams is that students need a lot of
interactive help in understanding how these diagrams work and exactly
what they represent. Just showing them the pictures with the
explanatory material from the websites is not enough.
</p><p>
Who can take the bull by the horns and get the truth into the hands of
the movers and shakers?
