  <i>Preferential voting software breaks down in San Francisco</i>
  Thu, 4 Nov 2004 10:07:12 PST
<br><br>
  In the election of 2 Nov 2004, San Francisco's district supervisor
  election used ranked-choice voting for the first time.
  It went just fine on Tuesday during the election.
  Preliminary results showed candidates in three districts had won by a clear
  majority (so no reranking-rounds were needed), whereas the other four seats 
  remained to be determined by the preferential ballot counting process.
  The computer processing broke down completely on Wednesday afternoon when election
  workers began to merge the first, second, and third choices into the
  program that is supposed to sequentially eliminate low-vote candidates
  and redistribute voters' second and third choices accordingly. 
<br><br>
  However [fortunately], no San Francisco ballots were lost, because each ballot has a
  paper trail.
<br><br>
  The software is provided by ES&amp;S (Election Systems and Software, in
  Omaha). This system has undergone federal and state testing, as well
  as pre-election testing in which everything seemed to work perfectly.
  The results of the four contested supervisors' races are expected to be delayed 
  up to two weeks.
