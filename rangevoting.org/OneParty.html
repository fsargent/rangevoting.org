<H2> <i>One</i>-party domination </H2>

<p>
You've heard of <a href="Duverger.html">two-party domination</a>,
caused by the repeated effect of voters not wanting to "waste their vote"
on third party candidates, causing them to get vastly lower vote counts
(lowering factors often exceed 10) and die out.
</p>

<p>
But in the USA, we more and more have <i>one</i>-party domination,
evidenced by the fact that congressmen and state house members in most (all?) states
get re-elected 98% of the time they try.
</p>

<p>
Over the decade 1995-2005, <a href="http://www.campaignline.com/oddsmaker/">
The Political Oddsmaker</a> by <a href="http://www.ronfaucheux.com/">Ron Faucheux</a>
(feature in <i>Campaigns &amp; Elections</i> magazine)
has made over 2,700 picks in U.S. Senate, gubernatorial, U.S. House,
major mayoral and initiative elections, with an overall record of correctly predicting
winners over 98.2 percent of the time.
And I'm not talking about predictions based on looking at poll results 1 day
before the election, and only in selected easy-to-pick races.  
No.  I'm writing this in October 2005, and Faucheux
has already posted his searchable database of nationwide predictions for the <i>2006</i>
elections, over 1 <i>year</i> ahead of time!
</p>

<p>
But it is even worse than that.
Suppose a state gets gerrymandered by the dominant party.
Then that party can (if the gerrymandering is optimal &ndash; and with computers 
optimality is getting more and more approachable) stay in majority control
permanently even with only 26% support.  (It simply creates exactly two kinds of
districts: those consisting 100% 
opposition party supporters, and those containing 51% their supporters.)
</p>

<p>
Now suppose you are a voter in one of those 100% opposition districts.  Year
after year, you elect an opposition party candidate.  That fellow
always is shouted down and loses in whatever he tries to
do in the state house.  Every time there is money to be distributed to districts,
your district does not get it.  This goes on year after year after year.
</p>

<p>
So along comes a candidate from the dominant party. He says to you: "I know
you are opposed to what I stand for.  But that does not matter because my party
is dominant and always going to win statewide anyhow.  What matters is, if you
elect me, then your district will finally get some state money
and your representative will finally be able to accomplish something
to help your district."
</p>

<p>
That is a strong argument, isn't it?  Kind of a "brute power counts, principles do not"
argument.  Trouble is, there is a lot of truth to it.
And so, after year after decade of this happening, the dominant party
solidifies
more and more control over the state.  The result is permanent one-party "machine"
domination of that state.  These machines can grow extremely corrupt, and they can be
nearly impossible to remove.  (Three notorious democratic-party machines were:
Tammany in New York State, the Daley machine in Chicago, and the Parr machine
in South Texas.  The GOP in 2003 made their play to set up such a machine in Texas with
an unprecedented district-redrawing in a non-census year.)
</p>

<p>
<small>
Incidentally, it is theoretically possible for this to happen on a <i>nationwide</i>
scale, although in the USA it has not (yet).  After his 2006 defeat,
Rhode Island's senator Lincoln Chafee remarked that the main reason he was a member
of the <i>Republican</i> party (which had enjoyed majority control
of congress for almost all of the preceding 12 years) was because that allowed him
to get money for Rhode Island.
</small>
</p>

<H3> More ways one-party domination can set in </H3>

<p>
Each of the two major parties argues "we need to gerrymander this state massively
to counteract the evil opposing party's similar efforts in other states."
Or argues "we need to make sure the
<a href="BiasedOfficials.html">election commissioner</a> in this state is an
ethics-challenged manipulative party
loyalist for us (rather than an unbiased ethical person) because we need to 
counteract the evil opposing party's similar efforts in other states."
Ultimate cumulative result: zero voter choice anywhere,
one-party domination everywhere.
Note that this pathological-feedback scenario is <i>enabled</i> by having
a <a href="Duverger.html">2-party</a> system in the first place, and that in
turn is a consequence of the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system.
</p>


<H3> Whooo-wheee, Supreme court says Gerrymandering anytime anyplace is just fine </H3>

<p>
Thought 98% predictability was bad?
On 28 June 2006, the US Supreme Court ruled that states could re-gerrymander themselves 
in any manner (no matter how biased) at any time 
&ndash; even <i>one day</i> before the election if they could manage that 
(well, that might be hard to manage for practical reasons)
&ndash;
and that all was totally constitutional.  
The only qualm they expressed was that the <a href="GerryExamples.html">gerrymandering</a>
had better not be explicitly ethnicity/race-based (whatever that means), although
presumably even those qualms will to a considerable extent no longer exist since
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was allowed to die without renewal shortly before
the Supreme's decision.  <small>Later note: Sorry, that claim was premature and untrue. 
The bulk of the VRA <i>was</i> renewed in 2006, despite news reports
indicating Republican efforts to derail this would be successful.</small>
(The Supreme's decision pertained to the
2003 Gerrymandering of Texas, which was conducted when the VRA was still in force.)
</p>
<p>
By conducting gerrymandering by computer (the computer knows the Democrat &amp; Republican
vote counts in every tiny precinct) one can argue that the gerrymander obviously was not 
explicitly set up to discriminate on the basis of race, since the computer didn't know anything
about race, it only knew about politics.  "Therefore,"
Q.E.D, every modern gerrymander is legal.
</p>
<p>
Presumably both parties will now go for maximum gerrymandering everyplace they can.
If so, then consequently, "98%" will increase to over 99% and voter choice and democracy in the USA
will probably be completely choked off for all district-based elections.
