<H2> Contacting the Center for Range Voting </H2>

<p>
We currently are trying to be decentralized, so you can best contact us by posting a message to
our <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">blog</a> in which case some
member of our community 
hopefully will respond to you.   
However, it is necessary to sign up as a "member" of this email list
in order to post to it (this will not result in you getting email,
unless you ask for it)  and the response might
be posted on the blog rather than directly emailed to you (you can read blogposts
via the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">hyperlink</a> even without
joining anything).
Also recommended is the Election Science Foundation
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/electionsciencefoundation">googlegroup</a>.
Once you've joined you
can post to the yahoogroup by emailing to
<tt>RangeVoting /AT/ yahoogroups.com</tt>
or also without email just using its web page (hit "post" button).
You can also send us email <i>without</i> joining anything at
<tt>rangevote AT gmail.com</tt>, but that address is checked less often by fewer people.
You can also contact specific CRV members if they have listed enough contact information under
their name in the <a href="voldir/Directory.html">directory</a>.
The two co-founders are entries 1 and 2 of that directory.
