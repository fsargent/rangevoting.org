<H2> Answer to Puzzle #2: election with 6 different winners in 6 different voting systems </H2>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b>
Find an example election in which 
Approval Voting,
Borda Voting,
Plurality Voting,
Plurality Voting with Top-Two Runoff,
Instant Runoff Voting,
and Condorcet methods,
all return different unique-winners.
Election examples with fewer voters and voter-types
are preferred as "more elegant."
</p>

<p><b>Solution</b> <small> by Warren D. Smith by making several improvements
on a  suboptimal solution 
by Joe Malkevitch</small>:
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow" cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>Their Vote</th></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> <font color="red">A</font>>D>E>C>B>F </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> <font color="red">B>E>D>F</font>>C>A </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> <font color="red">C>B>E>D>F</font>>A </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">D>C>F</font>>A>E>B </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">F</font>>C>E>D>B>A </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
11 voters, 5 voter-types, and 6 candidates (A,B,C,D,E, and F) in total.
</p>
<p>
<b>Plurality:</b> A wins (most top-rank votes with 4).
<br>
<b>Plurality+Runoff among top two:</b> B wins over A in the runoff, 6-to-5.
<br>
<b>IRV:</b> C wins
(eliminate E, D, F, and B in that order &ndash; it does not matter in which way you break the
DF tie &ndash; then C beats A in the final round by 7 to 4).
IRV repeatedly zaps the candidate with fewest
top-rank votes, then the remaining one wins.
<!-- Note, when F is eliminated, there
is a tie between F and C which we assume is broken in favor of C because
all the F-voters have C as their second choice at that point, whereas the C-voters
rank F near last place.  (If 
you are morally opposed to this tie-breaking gimmick, then a 19-voter solution with
7,5,4,2,1 in the #voters column does the job.) -->
<br>
<b>Borda:</b> D wins.   
(D's Borda score is 16+9+4+5+2=36 versus E with 12+12+6+1+3=34 and 
with lower scores for A, B, C, and F.)
<br>
<b>Condorcet:</b> E wins.  (Since E pairwise-beats each other candidate, e.g. beating
A 6:5, B 6:5, C 7:4, D 6:5, and F 9:2.)
<br>
<b><a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval</a> Voting:</b> 
If all the red candidates are approved, then F wins.
</p>

<p>
And with 0-99 Range Voting, it would in fact be possible to make <i>any</i> of the 6 
candidates win,
depending on how the voters chose the scores compatibly with the orderings above.
</p>

<p><b>Optimality:</b>
Obviously, 6 candidates is minimum possible in order to get 6 different winners.
We now shall <b>prove</b> that 11 voters also is minimum possible, and so is 5 voter types.
First, in order to have an untied plurality winner A, he must
have more votes (here 4) than any other.  Then the plur+runoff winner
B, in order also to be untied, must have more votes (here 3) than any other besides A.
Finally, the IRV winner C must, after benefitting from any vote transfers,
have more top-rank votes than B, i.e. must have at least 4 votes.
Hence there must be at least 4+3+4=11 voters if A has 4 votes, merely in order
to get distinct and untied Plurality, Plur+runoff, and IRV winners.
(Actually, 4+2+3 might also have been possible, except that it isn't, see below.)
On the other hand, if A had only 3 or 2 or 1 votes, then 4+3+4=11 would become 3+2+3=8
or 2+1+2=5 or 1+0+1=2 voters.  
<!-- The 1+0+1=2 case is not possible since there would be an AB tie in the runoff. -->
<br>
But C in order to be the IRV winner
cannot be eliminated, so C must have more top-rank votes than somebody at every round,
but less than B at the first round.
That means the top-rank votes for C,D,E,F must be distributed like 2,1,1,0 in the 4+3+4=11 case
(as they are), or like 1,0,0,0 in the 3+2+3=8 or 4+2+3 or 
other cases (which will not work since these cannot sum to at least 3 or 2 as they must).
<br>
Hence 11 is the minimum possible number of voters.
<br>
Finally, the above argument has also shown as a side effect that
5 is the minimum possible number of voter types.  Note that this optimality proof
did not even have to <i>mention</i> Borda, Condorcet, or Approval.

<h3> Addendum </h3>

<p>
Carl Bialik, the "Numbers Guy" at the <i>Wall Street Journal</I>, asked me
in Feb. 2009:
</p>
<blockquote>
Can you think of an example of a set of ballots with six candidates in
which each candidate wins under exactly one of the following systems?
<ul>
<li>Range voting (mean)
</li><li>Range voting (median)
</li><li>Borda Count
</li><li>Condorcet
</li><li>Instant runoff
</li><li>Plurality
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same example-election we gave above also works to solve Bialik's problem if we choose
the range-voting scores as follows (this is for 0-99 range voting; 
<small>it might also be possible
to accomplish Bialik's goal using 0-9, i.e "single digit," range voting, 
but I have not looked into that</small>):
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow" cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>Their Vote</th></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> <font color="red">A99</font>>D4>E3>C2>B1>F0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> <font color="red">B99>E67>D66>F65</font>>C1>A0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">C99>B98>E67>D66>F65</font>>A0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">C99>B98>E53>D52>F51</font>>A0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">D99>C98>F65</font>>A2>E1>B0 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td> <font color="red">F99</font>>C4>E3>D2>B1>A0 </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In this election, B wins using mean-based range voting,
with a mean score of 45.27 (beating F with 43.18 and D with 39.45)
but F wins using median-based range voting (F's median score is  65, beating
D with 52).  Note the candidates range-scored above 50 are the approved ones.
</p>

<h3> Bialik's 8-winner solution (Feb. 2009) </h3>

<p>
Bialik modified our original solution in a different way
[using 0-20 range voting and/or rank-order voting systems]
to make it have
<i>eight</i> different winners under the 8 voting systems, 
counting range-mean and range-median as
the two other kinds of winners. It's below.
Same six winners for the six systems described at top, 
<i>plus</i> g wins on
range-mean, 
h on range-median.
</P>
<p>
He noted:
Use same approvals as in the old example, and make g and h not approved
on the first two ballot sets (so each disapproved by seven, so they don't win
approval voting).   That is, in the below table of scores, 
the <font color="red"><u>underlined</u></font> votes are "approved."
</p>

<pre>
<b>#voters  a       b       c       d       e       f       g       h</b>

As rank-order ballots (omitting the numerical scores) this is:

3: <font color="red">b&gt;e&gt;d&gt;f</font>&gt;h&gt;g&gt;c&gt;a

1: <font color="red">d&gt;g&gt;c&gt;f</font>&gt;h&gt;a&gt;e&gt;b
1: <font color="red">f&gt;g</font>&gt;h&gt;c&gt;e&gt;d&gt;b&gt;a
</pre>

<p>
<b>Verification of winners:</b><br>
Plurality: a has four first-place votes, more than any rival.<br>
Top-2-runoff: b (The top 2 in the first round are a and b; then b is 
preferred by three of the four voters who ranked other candidates first, so beats a, 6-5.)<br>
IRV: c (after e,g,h, then d and f, then b, then a eliminated)<br>
Borda: d (with Borda score 52, followed by e in second place with Borda score 48)<br>
Condorcet: e is a beats-all winner (beats a, b, and d by 6:5 majorities each; 
beats others by larger majorities)<br>
Approval: f (with 7 approvals; d is next with 6)<br>
Range-mean: g with ColumnSum=70 beating d(57) and h(50).<br>
Range-median: h with median=14 beating g(13), e(12), d(11).<br>
<!--g13 h14 e12 d11 c5 b4 a0-->
