RangeVoting.org - Steve Hill responds to Clay Shentrup's anti-IRV letter

<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">
The <a href="IRVLetter.html" title="post below">post below</a> from a "range voting" advocate is 
filled with<br/> misinsformation and distortions regarding Measure O in Oakland,<br/> which will introduce the use of 
instant runoff voting to elect local<br/> offices. For example, the range of voting advocates writes:<br/> <br/> 
"Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is touted for its ability to take away<br/> the spoiler effect that small parties can have 
on an election,<br/> thereby also taking away the fear of voting for them, and giving a<br/> realistic idea of how much 
support they have."<br/> <br/> This range voting advocates apparently is unaware that elections in<br/> Oakland are 
nonpartisan. The benefits of IRV in Oakland have nothing<br/> to do with third parties, spoiling major party 
candidates, or<br/> anything like that. He has set up a "strawman" that does not apply.<br/> <br/> Then he postulates 
an election with the following results:<br/> <br/> % of Voters How They Voted<br/> 37% Nader &gt; Gore &gt; McCain<br/> 
31% Gore &gt; McCain &gt; Nader<br/> 32% McCain &gt; Gore &gt; Nader<br/> <br/> I'm not sure what planet or parallel 
universe would see Ralph Nader<br/> winning 37% of the vote in a three way race with Al Gore and John<br/> McCain, but 
it's certainly not any planet or universe that any of<br/> the rest of us live in. That's the interesting thing about 
all of<br/> these critics and advocates of other methods like IRV, they always<br/> propose these mathematical 
"paradoxes" that, while in theory are<br/> interesting for mathematicians to doodle around with on their sketch<br/> 
pads, in fact have no basis in reality. In the real world, these<br/> sorts of paradoxes rarely if ever manifest 
themselves. It's also<br/> possible that a meteorite will strike the Earth and wipe out life as<br/> we know it -- 
though not probably likely for a few more million<br/> years.<br/> <br/> This critic assails the argument that IRV will 
save money. He quotes<br/> a Princeton math doctorate, trying to bring a gloss of academic<br/> legitimacy but from a 
Ph.D. student who apparently knows nothing<br/> about the costs of voting equipment or election administration. I<br/> 
can tell you for a fact that in San Francisco we already have saved<br/> a ton of money by using IRV. We spent $1.6 
million for the cost of<br/> the IRV upgrade of the voting equipment, plus about another $750,000<br/> for the initial 
community education. Just in 2005 alone, we saved<br/> the cost of a citywide election -- about $3 million -- for 
the<br/> assessor-recorder race, which would have needed a December runoff<br/> election without IRV. Not only did we 
save $3 million, but in a<br/> runoff election for a very low-profile assessor-recorder race the<br/> voter turnout 
would have dropped to perhaps single digits (A few<br/> years ago, a city attorney runoff which has much more voter 
interest<br/> than assessor-recorder had voter turnout of approximately 13% of<br/> eligible voters). So San Francisco 
taxpayers saved $3 million by not<br/> having to set up precincts all over the city for a extremely low<br/> turnout 
election.<br/> <br/> On and on and on, this critic's post is filled with substantial<br/> distortions and 
misinformation. His opinion is unfounded on anything<br/> we would call facts or reality.<br/> <br/> There are other 
good single-winner systems out there besides IRV.<br/> Range voting may be one of them, but it is very untested in 
public<br/> elections anywhere. In any case, I fail to see why certain range<br/> voting advocates apparently think 
they can advance their preferred<br/> method by engaging in the age old winner-take-all tactic of slinging<br/> mud at 
what they perceive as their "opponent" -- that is, instant<br/> runoff voting. It's just the same old politics by 
another name.<br/> <br/> <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/people/steven_hill" title="Steven Hill">Steven
