<h2> Cynthia McKinney's "Voter Choice Act" (HR 2690), a failed 2005 bill </h2>

<p>
On 26 May 2005, Georgia's Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney
introduced the "Voter Choice Act (HR 2690)." She'd tried similar bills before.
Both this and the previous incarnations failed to win passage.
HR 2690 would have required that starting in 2008, all federal elections to
elect a single winner would use <i>instant runoff voting</i>! It also would
provide federal money to assist states with implementation costs.
2690 would also allow states to use <i>proportional representation</i> multiwinner
voting systems to elect congressmen.  Here it is.
