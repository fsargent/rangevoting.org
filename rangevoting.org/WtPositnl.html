Theorems on Weighted Positional voting systems
</H1>

<p>
A "weighted positional" voting system inputs rank-orderings as votes.
It elects the candidate with the greatest "score" where 
in the 3-candidate case,
you get 1 point for
being first ranked, 0 points for being last-ranked,
and <i>t</i> points for being middle-ranked for some 0&le;t&le;1.
(More generally for N-candidate elections with perhaps N&gt;3, you get score 
W<sub>1</sub> for being first-ranked in a vote, 
W<sub>2</sub> for being second-ranked in a vote, 
and so on, with
W<sub>1</sub>&ge;W<sub>2</sub>&ge;&hellip;&ge;W<sub>N</sub>&ge;0.)
</p>

<p><b>Important special cases (in the 3-candidate case):</b>
The <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
voting system arises when t=0.
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
arises when t=&frac12;.
AntiPlurality voting
arises when t=1.
</p>


<p>
In this web page we show that every weighted positional voting system,
in the 3-candidate case, automatically
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Exhibits <a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> (except for antiplurality voting)
</li>
<li>
Violates "clone immunity"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the bright side, though, all weighted positional voting systems 
trivially satisfy monotonicity (increasing your vote for X cannot decrease X's winning chances), 
"participation" (voting honestly is never strategically worse 
for you than not voting),  and consistency when partitioning country
into districts (if X wins in all districts, then X must win in combined country).

<p>
In this "Milk Wine Beer" election example by Don Saari (analysis added by Jack Rudd),<br>
B scores 5+4t, 
M scores 6+t,
and
W scores 2+8t.
</p><p>
Hence for 0&le;t&lt;1/3, M wins; 
for 1/3&lt;t&lt;3/4, B wins;
and for 3/4&lt;t&le;1, W wins.
</p>


<H2> 
All weighted positional systems (but one!)  exhibit "favorite betrayal"
</H2>

<p><b>THEOREM:</b>
Every weighted positional voting system <i>except</i>
anti-plurality voting
exhibits
<a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> in some 3-candidate election
situation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
    N+1
</td>
<td align="center">
B>C>A
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<td align="center">
    N
<td align="center">
C>A>B
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    N  
<td align="center">
A>B>C
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this (3N+1)-voter example 
<b>B wins</b>
in every weighted positional voting system with 0&le;t&lt;1, because the
scores are
B=N+1+Nt &gt; A=N+(N+1)t = C=N+(N+1)t.
But if the <i>N</i> C>A>B voters insincerely switch to A>C>B ("betraying their favorite" C) 
then the "lesser evil" <b>A</b> becomes the winner under all these voting systems 
(and is the Condorcet-winner), which in their view is a better election result.
(New scores:
A=2N &gt; B=N+1+Nt &gt; C=(2N+1)t  where the "&gt;"s are valid for all sufficiently large N.)
Any change which did not betray C (i.e. to C>B>A) would, however, not work, i.e,
B still would win.
<br>
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>

<p>
Actually, we can say more &ndash; we can totally classify all weighted positional
voting systems for any number of candidates that obey Favorite Betrayal:
</p>

<p><b>THEOREM:</b>
For each number C&ge;3, every weighted positional voting system
exhibits
<a href="FBCsurvey.html">favorite betrayal</a> in some C-candidate election
situation <i>except</i> if the top two weights are equal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
Similar to the above, except we now make a C-cycle rather than a 3-cycle, with N voters
in each of the C cyclic classes except for N+1 voters in one class breaking the perfect tie
so that A (say) wins the election.  Now consider the class of N voters which consider 
candidate A to be third-ranked.   These voters honestly rank (say) B second.
If they promote B insincerely to first place, betraying their true favorite, then
they (for all sufficiently large N, if the top two weights differ) 
will cause B to win, a result they prefer versus
A winning.  They can't do that unless they promote B to top (forcing favorite-betrayal, since they
already honestly had B ranked second).  Any insincere voting move that doesn't promote
B will cause A or somebody even worse in their view, to win, so favorite betrayal
was strategically forced.   Of course this was a group decision to strategize not
a single isolated voter decision, but by considering altering the votes one voter at a time
in this group, the first one that changes the election result is a situation where it's a single
voter's betrayal decision that does the job.

All weighted positional systems are vulnerable to <a href="CandCloning.html">candidate cloning</a>
</h2>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
In this situation, B beats A by 1 vote:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
    N-1
</td>
<td align="center">
A>B
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<td align="center">
    N
<td align="center">
B>A
</td>
</table>

<p>
Clone A into two clones A<sub>1</sub>
and A<sub>2</sub>.  Every A-voter prefers both A-clones over B,
and every B voter prefers B over both A-clones, and all voters
prefer A<sub>1</sub> over A<sub>2</sub>. 
The scores that result are
A<sub>1</sub> = (N-1)(t+1),
A<sub>2</sub> =  Nt,
and
B = N.
In other words (taking N sufficiently large) cloning
A converts A's loss into a win for A<sub>1</sub>
for each t&gt;0.
</p>
<p>
In this situation, A beats B by 2 votes:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
    2N
</td>
<td align="center">
A>B
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<td align="center">
    2N-2
<td align="center">
B>A
</td>
</table>

<p>
Clone A into two clones A<sub>1</sub>
and A<sub>2</sub>.  Every A-voter prefers both A-clones over B,
and every B voter prefers B over both A-clones, and half of
(each kind of) voter
prefers A<sub>1</sub> over A<sub>2</sub>,
the other half prefer  A<sub>2</sub> over A<sub>1</sub>. 
The scores that result are
A<sub>1</sub> = N+2Nt-t,
A<sub>2</sub> = N+2Nt-t,
and
B = 2N-2.
In other words (taking N sufficiently large) cloning
A converts A's win into a loss for both A-clones
for each t&lt;&frac12;.
</p>
<p>
The combination of both these examples has covered the entire range of allowable t,
namely all t with 0&le;t&le;1, showing that for each such t, cloning can either convert
a winner into two losers, or convert a loser into a winner, 
or (which happens if 0&lt;t&lt;&frac12;) both.
