<H2> "Pocket size" IRV example refuting Richie's "Core support" theory </H2>

<p><small>by Clay Shentrup</small></p>
<p>
Here is a 4-candidate Instant Runoff Voting election (candidates named A,B,C,D):
</P>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  35% </td>
<td> A > C > D > B </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  17% </td>
<td> B > C > D > A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  32% </td>
<td> C > D > B > A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  16% </td>
<td> D > B > C > A </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Instant Runoff Voting selects candidate
<b>B</b> as the winner, beating A in the final round, 65% to 35%.
</p><p>
But wait!
</p><p>
A huge 67% majority of voters would rather have candidate C than
candidate B. And candidate C received nearly twice as many first-place
votes as candidate B, 32% to 17%. And an even larger 83%
super-majority of voters would rather have candidate D than B (and D
got just a little fewer first-place votes than B). So the claim that
IRV "elects majority winners" is seriously misleading.
Also...
</p>
<ul>
<li> A is a spoiler (if he would drop out of the race, C would win
instead of B).
</li><li>
 The first row of voters have an incentive to betray candidate A by
pretending candidate C is their actual favorite - then they get their
second choice instead of their last.
</li><li>
 The third row of voters have an incentive to betray candidate C by
pretending candidate D is their favorite &ndash; then they get their 
second choice instead of their third.
</li><li>
 The first row of voters made a big mistake by voting honestly.
Suppose of the 35 first-row voters, 20 had simply refused to vote.
That move (not voting) would actually have been <i>better</i> for them than voting honestly
because it would have caused C to win (whom they prefer over B).  Their honest
"B is worst" votes
actually <i>caused</i> B to win!
</li></ul>
<p>
Also, C is the Condorcet "beats-all" winner, but doesn't make it to the final
round:
65% majority says C&gt;A;
67% majority says C&gt;B;
84% majority says C&gt;D.
</p><p>
And A is the Condorcet "lose-to-all" loser, but makes it to the final round
(65% majorities say others&gt;A).
