<H3> Advantages </H3>
<p>
The advantage of having our simple splitting
algorithm draw the congressional districts is obvious.
There is one and only one drawing possible given 
the number of districts
wanted, the map of the state, 
and the distribution of people inside it.  Which of those people are Liberal,
Conservative, Republican, Democrat, Black, White, Christian, Jewish, polka-dotted,
or whatever has <i>absolutely zero</i>
effect on the district shapes that come out.  So you know the maps are
going to be completely unbiased.  Get politicians to draw the maps and
you know that not only are they going to be completely biased, they
are also going to be a heck of a lot more
complicated-shaped and they are going to use up a lot of
your taxpayer money figuring out how
to best-rob you of your vote.  Which do you prefer?  It has been over 200 years.
Isn't it time to make gerrymandering a thing of the past?

<H3> The shortest-splitline <font face="fantasy">algorithm</font> for drawing N congressional
districts (part of our <a href="BallInit.html">ballot initiative</a>) </H3>

<p><small><a href="SSArecursive.txt">Formal recursive formulation</a></small></p>

<ol>
<li>
Start with the boundary outline of the state. 
</li>
<li>
Let N=A+B where A and B are as nearly equal whole numbers as possible.
<br>
(For example, 7=4+3.  
<small>More precisely, A = &lceil;N/2&rceil;, B=&lfloor;N/2&rfloor;.</small>)
</li>
<li>
Among all possible dividing lines
that split the state into two parts with population ratio A:B,
choose the <i>shortest</i>.  
(Notes: since the Earth is round, when we say "line" we more precisely mean
"great circle."  If there is an exact length-tie for "shortest" then break that tie by using
the line closest to North-South orientation, and if it's still a tie, then use the Westernmost of
the tied dividing lines.  "Length" means distance between the two furthest-apart points on
the line, that both lie within the district being split.)
</li>
<li>
We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B)
of districts.  Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.
</li>
</ol>

<FONT SIZE="-1">
<!-- Pleasant fact:
The districts produced by this method always can be colored in only two colors
so no two neighboring districts have the same color.  That saves printing costs.
Later note: False: 4 colors can be required! -->
<p>
<b>Asterisk:</b>
If anybody's residence is split in two by one of the splitlines (which would happen, 
albeit very very rarely)
then they are automatically declared to lie in 
the most-western (or if line is EW, then northern)
of the two districts.

It was Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry who is credited with inventing gerrymandering in
1812.   
He was voted out of office immediately by outraged voters, but his legacy evidently lives on.
Massachusetts has 100% Democratic congressmen and has for at least the last three
election cycles, despite having
a Republican governor (you can't gerrymander the governor race, since it is a statewide
election).  Here's a <a href="BGWed.html">Boston Globe Editorial</a>
on the subject.

<b>Texas</b>'s 32 congressional districts (side-by-side comparative chart
from the <i>Associated Press</i> as printed in the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> 9 Oct. 2003)
showing district shapes before and after the extraordinary
redistricting in 2003.

<!-- after is also  TX03map.jpg  in multicolor  -->
(And <a href="TXtravis24.png"> here [png]</a> is a closeup on what they did to Austin to 
split up those annoying Austin voters.)
The gerrymandering was not inconsiderable before the redistricting, e.g. check district 4
near Dallas.
But, after it &ndash; after it &ndash; aaah, for total statewide brazenness 
Texas really takes the cake.
Check district 19 (Lubbock in the north West) 
and the <i>whole East half of the state</i> is made of those
long thin districts.  And for extra amazement check those
closeups on Houston, and Tom DeLay's personal district 22.
Yup, definitely Texas is an unbelievable new champion.
(Check the 127-page <a href="TexasCourtDecn.pdf">Texas Court decision</a>
declaring this totally legal.  Before re-gerrying: Texas had 17 Democrat and 15 Republican
congress.  After, it was 11-to-21 the other way.

Wow.  I thought Texas was bad, but Illinois may be the new champ.
District 17 is just <i>awesome</i>.
But then again districts 19, 15, and 11 are no slouches.
You cannot actually see a lot of the small Chicago districts without a magnifying

(Notice it looks pretty bad... but then you realize it actually <i>continues</i> west
past the point you thought it had ended... going along
a thin strip lying entirely inside a highway... which loops around until expanding
to enclose a <i>second</i> bad-looking region.)

<b>California?</b>
<!--
Jill Stewart: Terminator vs Gerrymander, pA23, Nov 7 2005 NY Times,
supports prop 77 claiming it has to be better than the system California has
now. -->
In 2004, <i>not one</i> of CA's 173 state legislative and federal congressional seats
changed party-hands.  In 2002, <i>every</i> incumbent won re-election, on average with
69% of the vote.
California may be the new gerrymandering
champion, perhaps even worse than Illinois and Texas, but unlike them its gerrymandering is
"bipartisan" that is, arranged by agreement among the Democrats and Republicans to 
"design their own districts" to make every office holder  "safe."
(Later note: see <a href="CaliforniaDistrictRandom.html">this</a> about the new random-commission
system CA adopted in 2010-2011!)
(<small>
Specifically, CA state law causes any redistricting not approved by at least
2/3 of the state legislature to be challengeable by the voters in a referendum.
That forces the Democrats in control of California to
gerrymander for at least some Republican legislators too.  
Republican Assemblyman Roy Ashburn, vice-chair of the redistricting committe, 
told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> in May 20-01
"I think it is very possible... we can achieve a bipartisan redistricting... 
it takes openness and willingness to compromise."  And indeed the deal that was struck 
was to protect almost all
incumbents from both parties, allowing Democrats to keep all their seats but
also the Republicans could do so, plus the Democrats would draw one new district
&ndash; mandated by population growth &ndash; in such a way that they would
get that new one too. Only a few were troubled by the result, e.g.
Republican Assemblyman Tim Leslie told the <i>LA Times</i> "We won't 
have to worry about elections for six, eight, ten years because [the districts] are all 
pre-set.  Everybody wins... What happened to drawing lines
for the people of the state rather than ourselves?"
</small>)
The devil's jigsaw puzzle (gifs from Adam Carr's
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/">psephos</a>
database):
<a href="california1.gif">Northern Calif</a>,
<a href="california2.gif">Calif Bay Area</a>,
<a href="california3.gif">Central Calif</a>,
<a href="california4.gif">Los Angeles area</a>,
<a href="california5.gif">Southern Calif</a>.
All of Los Angeles is amazing  but district 53 in Southern Calif. (San Diego)
is especially neat since it actually goes out to sea and comes back to land.
</p>

<p>
<b>Florida?</b>
Holy cow, Florida (especially Eastern) may be even worse than California!
<a href="FlCong.pdf">(color pdf)</a>, 
<a href="florida1.gif">(Northern FL, gif from Psephos)</a>, 
<a href="florida2.gif">(Southern FL, gif from Psephos with closeups)</a>.
The district 22 &amp; 23 tandem team
is just beyond belief trying to neutralize as many Democrats as possible
so that Florida as a whole can be safely massively Republican-dominated;
you really need the closeup map to see its full glory.

<blockquote>
"There is no issue that is more sensitive to politicians of all colors and ideological 
persuasions than redistricting. It will determine who wins and loses for eight years." 
&ndash; Ted Harrington, political science chair, UNC-Charlotte, 
quoted during Shaw v. Hunt trial, March 1994
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. 
&ndash; Albert Einstein 
</blockquote>

<H3> Does our redistricting method have any <i>dis</i>advantages? </H3>

<p>
Yes, but they are tiny compared to its benefits.  Our district shapes
ignore geographic features such as rivers and highways, and political features
such as country boundaries inside state maps.  
As you can see from
the example-pictures above, 
the old approach of 
politicians drawing districts sometimes used those things, sometimes misused them,
and  other times conveniently ignored them, all with the principal aim of
maximally denying you fair representation.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of having a purely <i>mathematical</i> definition of the district shapes
is that there is absolutely no room whatsoever for bias or
any freedom of choice at all by district drawers.  That shuts the gerrymanderers down.
Period.   
</p>

<p>
We admit you may pay a small price for this, both financially, and occasionally
(in some areas) in convenience.  But the financial price is tiny compared to the
amount you will save from having a less-corrupt, more democratic government.
And actually,
considering you'll no longer have to pay an unwanted small army of
super-biased nerds to figure out how to draw and print those crazy maps, all lot of money 
will actually be <i>saved</i> with our scheme.
<small>
In 2001, California State Democrats paid political consultant 
Michael Berman $1.36 million
to draw the US House district map for California, with incumbent Democratic members
of Congress paying him collectively about $600,000.
"Twenty thousand is nothing to keep your seat,"
Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez told the <i>Orange County Reporter</i>.
"I spend $2  million [campaigning] every election. 
If my colleagues are smart, they'll pay their $20,000
and Michael will draw the district they can win in.  Those who have refused to pay?   
God help them."
See chapter 1 of <a href="RVPapers.html">Overton's book</a> for this story.
In contrast, our high-res computerized
splitline districting <a href="SplitLR.html">computation</a> for all 50 states <i>combined</i> 
cost us approximately 10 cents worth of electricity and less than 1 day worth of time.
</small>
And the inconvenience will usually actually be "convenience" because it
will be much easier to figure out which district you are in if
the maps are simple, as opposed to looking like a  salamander-octopus mutant
diseased with severe hives.
