Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki, in 2006, <a href="BalinskiL.html">proposed</a>
a voting method quite similar to range voting, but using median scores rather than 
average scores, and with an interesting tie-breaking method.
They wrote a <a href="assets/documents/BLpnusaPaper.pdf">paper (pdf)</a> about it.
An <a href="assets/documents/BalinskiLarakiPNASpdf.pdf">updated</a>
version of this paper has now appeared in the
<a href="http://www.pnas.org">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA)</a>.
They published a
still-later <a href="assets/documents/ElectionByMajorityJudgmentExptEvidenceFinal.pdf">paper</a> 
in 2011, then finally a book
</p><blockquote>
  M.Balinski &amp; R.Laraki: Majority judgment, MIT Press (Cambridge MA) 2011.
</blockquote><p>
Unfortunately that book in no way used the extensive review of the matter we shall now give, 
which is unbiased and the best in the  world;
and which they were well aware of since I'd told them about it years before 
they wrote their book.  I.e. I'm warning you that 
their book presents an extremely biased and incomplete 
(and intentionally so) 1-sided picture, and but does not tel you that it is doing so.
</p><p>
We also discuss B&amp;L's study of French voters in Orsay 2007 
<a href="OrsayTable.html">here</a>, and (better) we summarize a whole <i>collection</i> 
of simultaneous studies comparing many different voting systems in that same (France 2007)
presidential election (of which theirs is just one), 
<a href="French2007studies.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Balinski-Laraki voting method:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Voters supply, as their vote, numerical scores for each candidate from a fixed set
of scores.  (Balinski &amp; Laraki suggested the 6-point scale {1,2,3,4,5,6}
with 6=best and 1=worst.  Except actually they used <i>words</i> not numbers
as the score levels.)
</li><li>
The candidate with the greatest <i>median</i> score wins.
(If a candidate has an even number of scores, his <i>lower</i> bi-median is used
as his "median" score.)
</li><li>
If there is a tie, then we break it by considering the "median scores of rank 1."
That is, suppose the median score for each of the tied-set of candidates, is <I>M</i>.
Remove one 
<i>M</i> from each of the tied-candidates' multisets of scores, and recompute their medians.
These are "the medians of rank 1."  The tied-candidate with the greatest <i>M</i><sub>1</sub>
wins.
</li><li>
If there still is a tie, we continue on, computing the "medians of rank 2" which
are got by removing one median value from each still-tied-candidate's score-multiset 
and then recomputing
the median; we similarly may define medians of rank 3, 4, etc.  We keep going
until the tie is broken and we have a unique winner.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
B&amp;L give an <a href="BalinskiL.html#example">example</a>.
An improved B&amp;L-like voting method called <a href="#GMJ">GMJ</a> 
(it's the same as B&amp;L's but with an apparently simpler-&amp;-better
tie-breaking procedure), was invented later by Jameson Quinn.
</p>

<h3> Who invented this? </h3>
<p>
The idea of median-based range voting ("highest median rating") had also been considered
and discussed by several members of the 
<a href="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/">electorama</a> 
and 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">range voting</a> 
bulletin boards
during the years 1996-2007.
(Even something very similar, if not exactly equivalent,
to B&amp;L's tie-breaking scheme had been proposed, although I
have not been able to track that particular post down, so it may have just been in emails.)
</p>
<a name="MCAbenham"></a>
<p>
In particular, Chris Benham published his voting method "Majority Choice Approval" (<b>MCA</b>)
on the internet in 2004 (or before; I am not sure when Benham first did it).  MCA is: 
</p><ol><li>
Each voter provides a score in the 3-element set {-1, 0, +1}
to each candidate.
</li><li>
If at least one candidate has a majority of "+1" scores, then the candidate with the 
most "+1"s wins.
</li><li>
Otherwise, the candidate with the most "+1 or 0" scores wins .
</li></ol>
<p>
This method is equivalent to Jameson Quinn's "GMJ" method 
in the case where there
are exactly 3 score levels.  It may be that there is something 
especially good about the number "3" in this context.  Certainly MCA works well in my
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>
computer simulations.  MCA can also be regarded as similar to 
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.  (The "+1" scores can be regarded as "approvals"
and if anybody has &gt;50% approval, the most-approved wins.  Otherwise redefine "approval" to
mean "nonnegative" and the most-approved wins.)
</p><p>

<h3>How does this compare 
versus ordinary average-based range voting?
</h3>

<p>
Here's a disturbing example
created by Rob Lanphier in 1998.
In this 99-voter election
with 0-100 score range (four candidates A,B,C,D),
<b>B wins</b> under the Balinski-Laraki
voting method because B's median is 51 versus A's 50:
</p>


<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th colspan="4"> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 49 </td>
<td align="center">   A=100 </td><td>  B=52 </td><td>  C=0 </td><td>  D=0 </td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"> 
<td align="center"> 1 </td>
<td align="center">   A=50 </td><td>    B=51 </td><td>  C=100 </td><td>  D=0 </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 49 </td>
<td align="center">  A=49 </td><td>   B=0   </td><td>  C=0 </td><td>  D=100 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
98 out of 99 voters strongly prefer A over B, but the single voter 
who slightly prefers B over A is the one that matters &ndash; B wins!
Most people think that is not a good result;
Lanphier considered it so disturbing that (he said at the time) median-ratings
should be immediately dismissed from consideration as a voting system.
In contrast, with ordinary <a href="Averaging.html">average</a>-based range voting
A would win comfortably (A's average=74.25, B's average=26.25).
</p>

<p>
Prof. S.J. Brams indeed points out that <i>every voter except one</i> can strongly 
prefer <i>every</i> rival candidate
over B, but median-based range voting still will elect B (Lanphier's example above, but 
simplified so that only
A and B are in the race, shows that; and you can make example elections
demonstrating Brams's claim for any 
number of voters and 
also any number of extra candidates by adding further A-like candidates).
</p>

<!--
is this: Assume there are N voters.  
Then a candidate may lose if he is preferred to all other candidates by N-1 voters.
Here's an example (ratings on the scale {1,2,3,4,5,6}):
</p>

<table align="left" border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> A scores </th>
<td>  6 6 3 2 2   </td>
<td> median=3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> B scores </th>
<td>  5 5 4 1 1     </td>
<td> median=<b>4</b> </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
B wins, but every voter except one prefers A over B.
Put another way, not only may a Condorcet loser be the winner, 
but all-but-unanimous majorities may prefer every other candidate to the winner.
</p>
-->

<p>
Think Lanphier's 
example is contrived and artificial and wouldn't be a problem in the <b>real world?</b>
Wrong!  
I contend the following (while oversimplified) is actually a fairly realistic 
picture of what honest voting would have been in the USA 2000 presidential election
&ndash; or at least, of a 
of a realistic hypothetical election <i>like</i> it:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th colspan="3"> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 49 </td>
<td align="center">   Gore=100 </td><td>  Nader=30 </td><td>  Bush=0 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> 3 </td>
<td align="center">   Nader=100 </td><td>  Gore=20 </td><td>  Bush=0 </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center"> 48 </td>
<td align="center">  Bush=100 </td><td>  Gore=10   </td><td>  Nader=0 </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
With these votes, <b>Nader</b> would be the winner with median score 30.
But practically every other voting system mankind ever dreamed up would elect Gore.
Note that 97% of these voters strongly favor Gore over Nader; 52% favor Gore over Bush;
and the average scores are
Gore=54.4, Bush=48, Nader=17.7.
So Median-based range not only fails to elect the clearly-right winner Gore here, it
in fact elects the <i>worst</i> candidate.
</p>

<blockquote><small>
To be clear:
We are <i>not</I> trying to argue that Gore was actually best, nor Nader actually worst, 
in the actual USA 2000
election.  We are
simply trying to present an artificial but realistic scenario <i>somewhat motivated</i> 
by that election, <i>in which</i> "Gore" is best and "Nader" worst, and in which median-range 
misbehaves
while almost every other voting system works well.
</small></blockquote>

<p>
A related problem is Lomax's <a href="MajCrit.html#pizza">pizza-flavor choosing</a>
vote (0-9 score range), in which 3 friends want to buy a pizza, and one of them
is a Jew who cannot eat pepperoni.  All like mushroom, but the two non-Jews slightly
prefer pepperoni:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> Lomax's Pizza election </caption>
<tr> 
<th> Pepperoni scores </th>
<td>  9 9 0   </td>
<td> median=<b>9</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Mushroom scores </th>
<td>  8 8 9     </td>
<td> median=8 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="partition"></a>
<p>
Another problem with median-based versus average-based range voting, is that the former is
not "consistent with respect to partitioning into districts."
For example (now with score-range 0-9):
</p>

<table align="left" border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> District 1: A wins </caption>
<tr> 
<th> A scores </th>
<td>  9 8 7 4 0   </td>
<td> median=<b>7</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> B scores </th>
<td>  9 8 6 5 0     </td>
<td> median=6 </td>
</tr>
</table>
<table align="right" border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> District 2: A wins </caption>
<tr> 
<th> A scores </th>
<td>   9 4 3 2 0    </td>
<td> median=<b>3</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> B scores </th>
<td>   9 5 2 1 0      </td>
<td> median=2 </td>
</tr>
</table>
<table align="center" border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> Combined country: <b>B</b> wins! </caption>
<tr> 
<th> A scores </th>
<td>    9 9 8 7 4 4 3 2 0 0    </td>
<td> median=4 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> B scores </th>
<td>   9 9 8 6 5 5 2 1 0 0       </td>
<td> median=<b>5</b> </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In contrast,
with average-based range voting, if A wins in both districts, then A always wins in the
combined country (at least, if "blank" range-voting scores are forbidden).
</p>

<p>
Average-based range voting also has the advantage of being much <i>simpler</i> to describe than
Balinski &amp; Laraki's voting scheme.
<!-- and it works on 
<a href="VMSumm.html">every voting machine in the USA</a>, 
right now, with no reprogramming or modification required.  
(Median-based range voting can't say that?? Think it ca, with a little post-processing.)
-->
</p>

<a name="Bishop"></a>
<p>
Dan Bishop pointed out another problem with the median-based system:
election results can change if "all zero ballots" are
added.  As a simple example, consider this 3-voter election (0-9 score range):
</p>


<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>A wins.</caption>
<tr> 
<th> A's scores: </th>
<td>  1 6 9   </td>
<td> median=<b>6</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> B's scores: </th>
<td>  2 5 9   </td>
<td> median=5  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If an "all zero ballot" A=0, B=0 is added, then, according to Balinski &amp; Laraki's rules,
<b>B</b> is now the winner.  Indeed, one can easily set up scenarios with
N candidates (any N&ge;2) where adding some all-zero ballots <i>completely reverses</i>
the finish order!
In contrast, with average-based range voting <i>provided</i>
all voters score all candidates,
adding an all-zero ballot (or for that matter, any number of ballots which all
score all candidates equally)
never changes the winner and never changes the finish order.
</p><p>
(This property would enable an
interesting new kind of election fraud...:)
Actually, in Balinski &amp; Laraki's own polling <a href="OrsayTable.html">experiment</a> in 
France's 2007 presidential election, they instructed their voters
that if they left any candidates unscored, they would regard those as zero (minimum) score.
Hence by B&amp;L's own rules, if a voter did not show up at the polls to vote,
A would win. 
If however that voter did vote in some of the races on ballot, 
but in this particular A-versus-B race left both 
candidates unscored, then B would win.
</p><p>
Another issue,  related to some of the above, pointed out by Manzoor A. Zahid in 2009,
is this.
</p><table bgcolor="pink">
<tr><th>Candidate</th>
<th>Excellent</th>
<th>VeryGood</th>
<th>Good</th>
<th>Mediocre</th>
<th>Poor</th>
<th>Unacceptable</th>
</tr>
<tr><th>A</th>
<td>9%</td>
<td>41</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>B</th>
<td>4</td>
<td>47</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>29</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>B</b> wins according to Majority Judgment ("very good"), but A is rated "good" or better by
<i>every</i> voter, while B has a two-peaked distribution with many voters considering him 
unacceptable.  Zahid similarly criticizes these elections (<b>B</b> wins
according to Majority Judgment in both):
</p>
<table bgcolor="aqua">
<tr><th>Candidate</th>
<th>Excellent</th>
<th>VeryGood</th>
<th>Good</th>
<th>Mediocre</th>

<tr><th>A</th>
<td>1%</td>

<p>
</p>
<table bgcolor="lightgreen">

<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>B</th>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>51</td>
<td>49</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Average-based range voting also outperforms median-based 
in <a href="IEVS/Pictures.html">graphical comparisons</a>,
in computer measurements of <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>,
and in the eyes of the world's most experienced(?) election-practitioners,
<a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a>.
<small>
Also, range voting has been used for decades by academic graders, whom I do not think
would be willing to switch to medians.
</small>
</p>

<p>
Average-based range voting generalizes to a <i>multiwinner</i> 
<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>
voting system called <a href="RRV.html">reweighted range voting</a>.
(See papers 78 and 91 <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">here</a>.)
But there currently is no known way to generalize median-based range voting to do that
(or if there is, it is very complicated).
</p>

<p>
Average-based range voting is readily adapted to the case where voters have different "weights,"
e.g. type-A voters have 54+&pi; votes whereas type-B voters have only 1 vote each.
(Simply multiply the type-A votes by 54+&pi;...)  With median-based range voting it is
a good deal harder to handle that.
</p>

<a name="partic"></a>
<p>
An extremely bothering
problem with median-based range voting is its failure
of "participation."
Consider this situation:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>A wins.</caption>
<tr> 
<th> A's scores: </th>
<td>   9 6 5 3 0    </td>
<td> median=<b>5</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> B's scores: </th>
<td>   9 7 4 2 0    </td>
<td> median=4  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> C's scores: </th>
<td>   9 4 3 2 0  </td>
<td> median=3  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Now suppose you and your spouse (new voters) come.
Your votes are both: A=9, B=7, C=0, preferring the current winner A over every opponent.
These votes cause A to <i>lose</i>, because
the new election is now
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>B wins!</caption>
<tr> 
<th> A's scores: </th>
<td>   9 9 9 6 5 3 0    </td>
<td> median=6  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> B's scores: </th>
<td>   9 7 7 7 4 2 0    </td>
<td> median=<b>7</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> C's scores: </th>
<td>   9 4 3 2 0 0 0  </td>
<td> median=2  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In short, you and your spouse's decision to vote honestly, made the election result worse
from your point of view.  You would have been better off not voting at all
("no-show paradox").  
In contrast, with average-based range voting, no-show paradoxes can never occur
<i>provided</i> there are no <a href="Blanks.html">blank</a> (no opinion) votes.
<small> They <i>can</i> occur if blanks are allowed and are discarded before averaging.  E.g. 
A scores: 9 0 and four blanks, avg = 4.5;
B scores: 5 5 5 5 5 5, avg = 5;
B wins; but you now add your vote A=8, B=9.
That raises A's average to 17/3=5.667 and B's to 39/7=5.571
so now A wins; this example is valid if there is no <a href="RuleD.html">quorum rule</a>.
</small>
</p>

<p>
Balinski &amp; Laraki pointed out the following enjoyable property
of median-ratings (which had earlier
been stated, albeit somewhat more clumsily worded, by electorama posters including Bart Ingles
in 1999):
</p>

<p>
<b>MAJORITY THEOREM (Bart Ingles, then M.Balinski &amp; R.Laraki):</b>
With median-rating, the winner W has the property that a majority  of voters 
unanimously rates
him &ge;M, while no majority unanimously rates any opponent &ge;M.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, average-based range voting does not enjoy that property, and indeed
both average- and median-based range voting fail
the <a href="CondDQ.html">traditional definition</a> of the "Condorcet property."
But both average-based and median-based range voting obey a
<a href="CondDQ.html">nontraditional definition</a> of that property
and both, under reasonable assumptions about the behavior of 
<a href="AppCW.html">strategic voters</a>, will elect a Condorcet winner whenever
one exists.
</p>

<p>
However, Ingles' theorem is not as nice as it sounds.
Here's an example (0-9 score range, three candidates):
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>
<b>A</b> wins under Balinski &amp; Laraki's rules.
</caption>
<tr> 
<th> A's scores: </th>
<td>  0 4 6 9   </td>
<td> median=<b>4</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> B's scores: </th>
<td>  0 3 7 9   </td>
<td> median=3  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> C's scores: </th>
<td>  0 3 8 9   </td>
<td> median=3  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
As assured by the theorem,
a majority of voters unanimously agree that A&ge;4, whereas <i>no</i>
voter-majority unanimously agrees that B&ge;4 (or that C&ge;4).
Sounds great at first, but... it is also true that
a voter-majority unanimously agrees that A&le;6, whereas
<i>no</i>
voter-majority unanimously agrees that B&le;6 (or that C&le;6).
So by the same logic Balinski &amp; Laraki 
used to conclude A was the best, we can conclude A is 
the <i>worst</i>!
So it seems as though Balinski &amp;  Laraki's logic is self-contradictory.
(About <a href="IrvRevFail.html">reversal failure</a>; average-based range never
suffers that.)
Personally, in this situation I would prefer to elect C, not A, but that is just my
opinion.
</p>
<a name="ungerex"></a>
<p>
Steve Unger also points out the following example which also shows that Ingles' theorem is
not as nice as it sounds and 
makes medians look bad
(and the median-based result <i>is</i> bad, in the view of a 78% super<b>majority</b>
of the voters):
</p>

<table cellspacing="15">
<caption>
In this 9-voter 3-candidate election by Unger, 
7 of the 9 voters prefer C over B (and 5 of the 9 prefer C over A)
so C would defeat every rival head-to-head;
but B wins with the highest <i>median</i> score 2.
(Using <i>average</i>-based score voting, C wins with 2.00, A is second with 1.78 and B finishes
far last with 1.11.)
</caption>
<tr><td>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="PapayaWhip">
<tr> 
<th> A's scores: </th>
<td>  0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4  </td>
<td> median=0  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> B's scores: </th>
<td>  0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2  </td>
<td> median=<b>2</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<th> C's scores: </th>
<td>  1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4  </td>
<td> median=1  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</td><td>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="PapayaWhip">
<tr> <th> #voters </th><th> Their Vote </th> </tr>
<td>  4 </td><td> A=4 B=0 C=1 </td></tr>
<td>  3 </td><td> A=0 B=2 C=4 </td></tr>
<td>  2 </td><td> A=0 B=2 C=1 </td></tr>
</table>
</td><tr>
</table>

<p>
Unger's example has been criticized because the last 2 voters provided
"non-normalized" ballots in which they did not employ the full 0-4 score range.
If you do not like that, then change those two votes to become 
"A=0 B=4 C=1" in which case:
<ul><li>
All 9 ballots now are "normalized."
</li><li>
B still unfairly wins using medians (all medians unchanged)
</li><li>
C still is
preferred by 7/9 voters over B and by 5/9 over A
</li><li>
only the average-based scores change and now are C=2.00, A=1.78, B=1.56
(finish-order unchanged).
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
Finally, Balinski &amp; Laraki's median-based scheme is more <i>complicated</i> than
mean-based range voting.
</p>

<H3> Tyranny of Majority </H3>

<p>
A typical "tyranny of majority" scenario (which I'm told is rude to discuss)
is the "kill the Jews" vote.
That is, there is a majority of non-Jews, and a minority of Jews, and they all vote
on the question "should the Jews be killed and their money stolen and used to reduce taxes
for the survivors?"
</p><p>
The same abstract type of scenario arises 
(fortunately usually in less dramatic form) all the time, e.g.
many "ban gay marriage" referenda passed in USA states in 2008, and 
on 30 March 1855 a Kansas-wide referendum voted to make slavery legal.
</p><p>
In such votes some proposal has a very bad effect on the minority,
but a slightly good effect on the majority, of people.   The badness can
(and did in the case of the Jews!)
outweigh the goodness.  It is an unfortunate fact that
most voting methods will, with honest voting
(where by "honest" we mean: each voter honestly says which choice would have the best effect on 
her <i>alone</i>) kill the Jews.
</p><p>
Ordinary (average-based) <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> is
one of the few voting methods that is capable of going <i>against</i> the will of
the majority.  This happens <i>only</i> if the minority expresses their preferences strongly enough
while the majority expresses their views weakly (both moves are honest). 
It could
mean that range voting would save the Jews while almost every other voting method 
would kill them.
(It is a fact &ndash; observed in every large range vote that I have ever seen &ndash;
that a large fraction of voters do <i>not</i> choose to exaggerate all their scores 
to max and min.)
This in my view is a considerable advantage for range voting versus almost every rival
voting method.
</p><p>
Which brings us to our point:   
<b>Median-based range voting seems to be <i>more vulnerable</i>
to tyranny of majority</b>
than average-based range voting.
Specifically, imagine with range 0-to-9, that there are exactly two kinds of votes: 
strong-preference votes "kill=0, live=9" (cast by honest Jews) and
weak-preference votes  "kill=5, live=4" cast by honest non-Jews.
In such a scenario, if the Jews exceed 10% of the population, average based range voting 
will let them live.  However, median-based range voting will <i>always</i> kill
the Jews, no matter what percentage they are (provided they are a minority) and no
matter what the particular four numerical scores (here 0, 9, 4, and 5) are.

<a name="enactability"></a>
<h3> Enactability </h3>

<p>
It <a href="WhatVotersWant.html">appears</a> from poll data
that average based range voting is enactable 
by referendum, while MJ is not (probably due to its greater complexity).
</p>

<a name="GMJ"></a>
<h3>"Graduated majority judgment" (GMJ) </h3>

<p>
GMJ was suggested by Jameson Quinn 
as an improvement/simplification over Balinski &amp; Laraki's
original  Majority Judgment method. It also can be regarded as a continuous-time version
of "Bucklin voting" (as improved so that equal and/or omitted ranks are allowed).
It works as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each voter grades each candidate on a grading scale such as A, B, C, D, F.
</li><li>
The top-grade (e.g, A) votes for each candidate are tallied.
</li><li>
If a <i>single</i>
candidate has a majority (that is, a number of votes &ge;50% of voters), he wins.
</li><li>
If <i>no</i>
candidate has a majority the next grade down (e.g. B) is added to the tallies 
and go back to step 3.
</li><li>
If <i>more than one</i>
candidate has a majority, then remove the last grade used from the tallies
and re-add it back "gradually" that is, at time t, 0&lt;t&lt;1, we have added a fraction t
of his votes at that grade to each candidate's tally.   As soon as any candidate
achieves &ge;50% of the number of voters, this process stops and he is declared winner.
<blockquote>
If a candidate has V votes with &Delta; to be added at the next grade, then
the value of t causing the 50% threshhold H to be hit, is t=(H-V)/&Delta;.
The winning candidate is the one with the least such t, among t with 0&lt;t&le;1.
</blockquote>
</li></ol>

<p>
If each iteration of the loop (steps 3 &amp; 4)
is regarded as consuming 1 "time unit" then the "total time" before each candidate reaches 50%
can be regarded as a measure of how good that candidate is, 
and used to order all the candidates (not merely to choose a winner).
</p><p>
A natural name for this voting system would have been
"first past the post," except that that phrase
was already stupidly employed to describe <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting.
("Stupidly" because with plurality voting
there is no "post" and there is no "time" scale to use to reckon "first.")
</p>
<!--
In addition to its better simplicity, GMJ enjoys this advantage over MJ:
Bishop's <a href="#Bishop">objection</a> to MJ, involving adding "all-zero ballots,"
does not work against GMJ???  Wrong. Still works.
-->

<h3>Shared advantages of median- and average-based range voting</h3>

<ul>
<li>
In both systems voters provide quantitative scores for all candidates, "maximizing
voter-expressivity."
</li><li>
Both systems enjoy "anonymity" (all voters treated equally), "neutrality" (all candidates
treated equally), "unanimity" (unanimous winners always win),
and "independence from irrelevant alternatives"
(the ratings for candidate C do not affect the relative judgments of A versus B).
</li><li>
Both systems reduce to the <i>same</i> system &ndash;
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> &ndash; if the allowed scores are
restricted to the two-element set {0,1}, i.e. each voter "approves" or "disapproves"
each candidate.
</li><li>
Both systems are "monotonic," i.e. a voter by increasing her score for X cannot decrease X's
winning chances.
</li><li>
Both systems enjoy immunity to candidate <a href="CandCloning.html">cloning</a>.
</li><li>
Both have the enjoyable property that 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/FBCexecSumm.htmlCandCloning.html">betraying your favorite does not pay</a>.
</li><li>
Both easily allow having <a href="Blanks.html">no opinion</a> votes.
</li><li>
And both systems to some extent evade the
<a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow</a>
and
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite</a>
impossibility theorems
(<small>as was remarked by Warren D. Smith in his 1999 paper on range voting</small>).
</li>
</ul>

<a name="summ1"></a>
<h3>Conclusion so far</h3>

<p>
Balinski &amp; Laraki's proposal has a lot in common with 
ordinary mean-based <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>,
but relatively speaking suffers numerous disadvantages.
I cannot currently see how it can have enough relative advantages
to compensate for that.
</p><p>
Hence I recommend ordinary range voting.
</p><p>
<i>However...</i> there are more arguments to be considered; see below.

<h2>What about <i>Strategy</i>?</h2>
<a name="blquote"></a>
<p>
The 6 Feb. 2009 "Numbers Guy" column in the Wall Street Journal
("And the Oscar Goes to...Not Its Voting System") contained 
</p>
<center>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen">
Prof. Balinski... 
calls (mean-based)
range voting a "ridiculous method," because it can be manipulated by strategic voters.
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
Balinski &amp; Laraki's <a href="assets/documents/BalinskiLarakiPNASpdf.pdf">PNAS-USA paper</a>
contains a lot of theorems aimed at justifying or formalizing the notion 
that median-based range voting is somehow "optimal" in the 
sense that it is "least vulnerable to manipulation by strategic voters."
</p>
<p>
We shall now re-examine that.
I personally think that Balinski &amp; Laraki's "optimality" 
and "vulnerability to strategy"
definitions 
were contrived &ndash; with <a href="PuzzJGA.html">other</a>
(but seemingly at least as reasonable) definitions, their theorems utterly fail.
Furthermore, even to the extent they are correct, their results may have little
impact in the real world &ndash; because, e.g. even if a voting method often 
offers only
half the incentive to strategize, then so what &ndash; maybe exactly the same voters 
will strategize anyhow!  (B&amp;L offered no evidence to the contrary and indeed 
the evidence they themselves found 
in the France 2007 election seems to support my view &ndash; their
voters employed plenty of strategy!)
</p><p>
However, B&amp;L's work is not completely valueless.
As our examination will show, there are circumstances under which median-based range voting 
should outperform mean-based range; and we shall develop understanding of 
just what circumstances favor median and which favor mean.
</p>
<a name="trimmedmean"></a>
<h3> "Trimmed mean" family of rated-voting systems </h3>
<p>
There is a family of voting systems 
<i>intermediate</i> between mean- and median-based
range voting: 
<b><a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed mean</a></b>
range voting.
That is: with trimming-fraction T, 0&le;T&lt;50%, you discard the top T
percent of Reagan's scores, also discard the bottom T percent, and then Reagan's final
"trimmed mean" score is the mean of his undiscarded scores.   The candidate with the highest 
trimmed mean wins.  In this view, 
<ul><li>
Average-based range voting is trimmed-mean with T=0
</li><li>
Median-based range voting is trimmed-mean with T=50%-&epsilon; (and with Balinski &amp;
Laraki's tiebreaking scheme invoked if necessary afterward)
</li><li>
Both schemes (and this also is true for every T with 0&le;T&lt;50%)
if all voters strategically exaggerate all scores to the top or bottom of
their allowed range, become equivalent to <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
A natural question is: what is the best value of the "trim-off parameter" T?
Is it T=0, T&rarr;50%, or somewhere in between?
</p>
<h3> Reduced voter-incentive to strategically exaggerate with median &ndash; fool's gold? </h3>
<p>
Balinski &amp; Laraki's <b>point</b>
seems to be that for a substantial class of voters, there is
<i>zero</i> incentive in median-based range voting to score somebody dishonestly:
</p><a name="blthm"></a><p>
<b>ZERO-INCENTIVE THEOREM:</b> exaggerating candidate-X's score in
your median-based range vote, will never help you move
X's societal-median score toward what you consider to be a more-correct value than
the unmanipulated value it had with your honest score-vote.
</p><p>
That sounds good at first, but the more you think about it, the less 
this "non-incentivation of strategy" really seems to matter.
</p><p>
Let's examine the situation. <i>Suppose</i> the societal
median score for <b>Gore</b> is <b>6</b> and
for <b>Bush</b> is <b>5</b> and the score-range is 0-to-9.  Then:
</p>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="pink">
<td width="50%">
You have <i>zero</i> incentive to strategize (since Bush &amp; Gore's societal 
median scores will remain unchanged even if you exaggerate all the way like Bush=0, Gore=9
or the reverse) if...
</td>
<td width="50%">
You <i>do</i> have incentive to strategize by exaggerating-to-the-max if...
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="yellow">
<ul><li>
your honest scores are Bush=4, Gore=8.
</li><li>
your honest scores are Bush=8, Gore=3.
</li><li>
your honest scores are Bush=5.7, Gore=5.2.
</li></ul>
</td>
<td bgcolor="yellow">
<ul><li>
your honest scores are Bush=7, Gore=8.
</li><li>
your honest scores are Bush=3, Gore=4.
</li><li>
your honest scores are Bush=5.2, Gore=5.7.
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
Considering the cases, <i>in a tight 2-way race with median-based range voting
about 50% of the voters have zero incentive to strategize and 50% have
incentive.</i>
</p><p>
B&amp;L seem to think that therefore, there will be lots of honest voting.
However a different way to look at it is: <b><i>no</i> voter in this median-based range voting
Bush-Gore scenario is hurt by strategizing, but 50% of them are hurt by not
strategizing. And it cannot be entirely clear a priori to any voter which kind she is.</b>
</p><p>
Furthermore, that was only thinking about the effect of <i>one</i> voter altering her vote
in isolation.
If <i>many</i> voters do so, their effects <b>synergize</b> to move the median, which means that
somebody who "has no incentive" actually <i>would</i> have incentive once the other strategizers
(those who originally had incentive) get done moving it. 
The more it moves, the more voters have incentive to move it.
<small>E.g, consider the situation when the societal median scores have
moved to Gore=8.6 and Bush=0.4, and then you
as a typical slightly Gore-favoring voter, would then
have incentive to exaggerate your scores to
9 and 0 to increase Gore's win even more, 
even if originally you had no incentive because originally your vote-alteration could 
not have altered Bush's and Gore's medians.</small>
So really, <i>more</i> than 50%
of the voters have incentive, and this keeps snowballing until 100% of the Gore&gt;Bush
voters will be incentivezed to strategize and the medians move all the way to 9 and 0.
</p><p>
So in view of the synergization and/or the incomplete knowledge effects, 
<i>everybody</i> would want to strategize, i.e. vote dishonestly &ndash;
exactly the opposite of B&amp;L's goal!
</p><p>
Oops.
</p>

<a name="side1"></a>
<h3> With "one-sided strategy" (in a simple model): Medians hurt, not help! </h3>
<p>
Here's another serious problem.
Remember, a big (for some people "the whole" &ndash; see the Balinski "ridiculous"
<a href="#blquote">quote</a> above)
motivating idea behind median-based
instead of average-based range voting was to get more immunity to "one-sided" strategy, 
e.g. strategy by the Bush&gt;Gore voters
which is not countered by the Gore&gt;Bush voters.
[They had been satisfied with plain average-based range voting
in the case where there was <i>both</i> strategy and counterstrategy.
<i>The great fear of these critics was unbalanced 1-sided strategy.</i>]
</p><p>
<small>
In all my <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
studies up to early 2009, mean-based range voting
outperformed median-based with any strategic+honest voter mix, <i>but</i>
all those studies involved voters who independently "flipped a probability=p coin"
to decide whether to be honest or strategic. In other words, their
decision to be strategic was <i>unrelated</i> to their politics. 
I could have, but
did not, try to have voters whose p-values were <i>correlated</i> with their
politics.  We're now going to consider the maximum-bias situation of that sort.
But actually the old simulations, since they usually were about elections with &le;200 voters,
usually <i>already</I>
had fairly large strategy-1-sideness bias just from the random voter decisions.
</small></p><p>
<b>But:</B> does median actually <i>work</i> to solve the 1-sided strategy problem?
Let's work out a simple scenario, using altogether too much math.
</p><p>
<b>The simple model:</b>
Suppose each voter has honest score for each candidate that is an independent
random-uniform real number in [0,1].
</p><p>
That implies there are 50% Bush&gt;Gore, and 50% Gore&gt;Bush, voters.
The Gore&gt;Bush voters have a triangular probability density of Gore scores:
ProbDensity(x)=2x, with mean score 2/3 for Gore and mean=1/3 for Bush.
The Bush&gt;Gore voters have the same triangular probability density of Bush scores
and mean score 2/3 for Bush and mean=1/3 for Gore.
Now suppose a fraction <b>F</b>, 0&le;F&le;1, of the Bush&gt;Gore voters exaggerate to
Bush=1, Gore=0.  We'll assume there is no counterstrategy by the
Gore&gt;Bush voters &ndash; they just stay honest.
</p><p>
What is the effect on Gore &amp; Bush's final scores?

<b>SCORE-DISTORTION THEOREM:</b>
Median-based range voting always causes more score-distortion
than average-based (under this scenario with 1-sided strategy) if
0.464102&le;F&le;1.
Median causes less distortion if
0&lt;F&le;0.464101, but the two distortions in this domain are very close, see graph.
I.e.</p><center>
([F-1]+[1-F]<sup>1/2</sup>)/F 
&nbsp; &le; &nbsp;  
(3-F)/6
&nbsp; &le; &nbsp;  
(3+F)/6
&nbsp; &le; &nbsp;  
(1-[1-F]<sup>1/2</sup>)/F
</center><p>
for every F with 0.464102&le;F&le;1,
while in the range 0&le;F&le;0.464101 the maximum difference &Delta; between
<nobr>([F-1]+[1-F]<sup>1/2</sup>)/F</nobr> 
and
<nobr>(3-F)/6</nobr>
is 
<nobr>&Delta;&asymp;0.0058</nobr>
achieved when F&asymp;0.2540, see "max difference" point on the graph.
[Note: only <a href="ElMargins.html">two</a>
US presidential elections up to 2010 have had |margin|&lt;2%.]
We have equality in the all-honest-votes
limit F&rarr;0 and at the crossover point 
<nobr>F=2&radic;3-3&asymp;0.4641.</nobr>
</p>
<a name="fancygraph"></a>
<img src="assets/images/GoreStratGraph.png"/>
<p>
PROOF: The formulas are worked out as follows.
You note that there are three kinds A,B,C of voters, present in proportions
</p><center>
     F/2 : (1-F)/2 : 1/2     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; [which sum to 1],
</center><p>
who respectively rate  Gore=0, Gore=honest, and Gore=honest. 
The type B&cup;C voters (combined set) have a trapezoidal probability density of scores
with the two trapezoid leg-heights being (1-F) and 1 (up to a constant multiplicative 
scaling factor you need to choose to make the total probability-mass be 1, i.e. "normalized")
at the Gore=0 and Gore=1 sides respectively.
Gore's <b>median</b> score is then <i>m</i> where
</p><center>
F/2 + (1-F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;m</sub>[(1-F)+Fx]dx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)+Fx]dx 
= 
1/2.
</center><p>
This simplifies to
</p><center>
   F/2 + (1-F)m + (F/2)m<sup>2</sup> = 1/2
</center><p>
a quadratic equation with solution
</p><center>
   m = ([F-1] + [1-F]<sup>1/2</sup>)/F.
</p></center>
Meanwhile, Gore's <b>average</b> score is
</p><center>
  0 + (1-F/2)&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)+Fx]xdx
<big>/</big>
&int;<sub>0&lt;x&lt;1</sub>[(1-F)+Fx]dx
</center><p>
(note the integrals in the denominators
are just there to provide the right normalization-constant
for the trapezoidal probability density).  This simplifies to
</p><center>
 GoreAverage =  1/2 - F/6 = (3-F)/6.
</center><p>
Now if we solve the "crossover" equation
</p><center>
 GoreMedian = GoreAverage
</center><p>
i.e. solve
</p><center>
 (F-1 + [1-F]<sup>1/2</sup>)/F = (3-F)/6
<!-- F=2*sqrt(3)-3=0.464 and F=0 -->
</center><p>
for F, we find that the only real solution is F=2&radic;3-3=0.4641...  
</p><small><pre>
<b>Details:</b>
  6(1-F)<sup>1/2</sup>/F = 3-F - 6(F-1)/F
  6(1-F)<sup>1/2</sup> = (3-F)F - 6(F-1)
  6(1-F)<sup>1/2</sup> = 6-3F-F<sup>2</sup>.
  36(1-F) = (6-3F-F<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
  F<sup>4</sup> + 6F<sup>3</sup> - 3F<sup>2</sup> = 0
  roots of this quartic are
  F=0&plusmn;0 and F=-3&plusmn;2&radic;3
  i.e.  F=0, F=0, F&asymp;0.4641, and F&asymp;-6.4641.
</pre></small>
In other words,
median is less distorted than average when 0&lt;F&lt;0.4641...,
but average is less distorted when 0.4641...&lt;F&le;1.
The two are equally affected when either F=0 or F&asymp;0.4641.
</p><p>
<b>Q.E.D.</b> <small>We thank Jameson Quinn finding an error in our old proof, now fixed.</small>
</p><p>
In view of this, the underlying motivation that medians save us
from 1-sided strategy, or that it reduces
the distortionary effect of strategy by about a factor of 6, or 2... 
all are seen to be bogus.
The reality (at least in this simple model) is:
average-based range is <i>more resistant</i> to strategy than
median-based, entirely contrary to my original (and Balinski &amp; Laraki's) intuition!!
</p><p>
And I think it is obvious average-based is better with 100% <i>honest</i> voters
and with mixtures of honest and (2-sided) strategic voters &ndash;
and in case it isn't obvious, the
<a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a> simulations indicate that.
</p><p>
In the scenario above if a fraction-F of <i>all</i> voters exaggerate (now
independent of their politics, i.e. no longer 1-sided) 
then we get average=median=0.5 for both Bush &amp; Gore, i.e. the
2-sided strategizing &amp; counterstrategizing exactly canceled out in both systems.
</p><p>
So this has been just one simple model, but as far as it goes it indicates
</p><ol>
<li>
average is superior to median.
</li><li>
naive intuitions were wrong.
</li></ol>

<h3> Something wrong with that 1-sided strategy model? </h3>

<p>
A <b>criticism</b> of the above simple 1-sided strategy model, raised by Jameson Quinn,
is this: it models <i>all</i> Bush&gt;Gore voters as equally likely to decide to
strategically exaggerate.   It might be more realistic to assume that the
voters with greater Bush-Gore honest score difference, are <i>more</i> likely to exaggerate.
Of course, this would directly <i>contradict</i> Balinski &amp; Laraki's 
<a href="#blthm">theorem</a>
above; B&amp;L's point was that those voters supposedly
are exactly the ones with "zero incentive"
to exaggerate!   But we plunge onward anyhow.  Jameson Quinn (and/or me) mooted several 
possible ways to put this effect into the model, but they all have problems:
</p><ol>
<li>
We could make the probability a Bush&gt;Gore voter decides to strategize be
<i>linearly proportional</i> to her Bush-Gore honest score difference.
Unfortunately that turns out to be logically inconsistent!  If you try
to get (a) proportionality and (b) make expected fraction F of 
the Bush&gt;Gore voters exaggerate,
then it turns out accomplishing both (a) and (b) 
simultaneously is <i>impossible</i> when F&ge;0.34.
</li><li>
We could try
making the probability proportional
to the <i>Pth power</i> of the Bush-Gore honest score difference, where, say, P=0.3.
However, as of now there still is no proof that any P with 0&lt;P&le;1
suffices to get logical consistency, plus
this whole idea seems an unnatural kludge anyhow (why P=0.3?).
</li><li>
We could make the fraction F of the Bush&gt;Gore voters with the <i>largest</i>
Bush-Gore honest score differences, be the ones who exaggerate (the "top end").
But that would entail the <i>maximum</i>
possible amount of contradiction with the Balinski-Laraki
"zero incentive" theorem above which had been motivating the whole investigation
that Median might help save us from strategy.
</li><li>
You could compare "apples to oranges" by assuming the top end of the average-based
Bush&gt;Gore range voters are the ones who exaggerate, but the bottom end of these
voters are the ones who exaggerate with median-based range (this makes sense in view
of the Balinski-Laraki "zero incentive" theorem).   This biased-change presumably would
make average look even <i>better</i> relatively to median, as far as resistance to 1-sided strategy
is concerned(!), because the top end by exaggerating alters averages less than
if the bottom end exaggerates.
</li><li>
You could argue that the Balinski-Laraki theorem means the top end won't 
want to exaggerate, which would counter Quinn's psychological force that makes
the top end more likely to exaggerate. In that case maybe we should just model all
Bush&gt;Gore voters as approximately equally likely to do it.
But wait &ndash; that's what our original model already did.
</li></ol>

<a name="side1a"></a>
<h3> An improved (in the sense of being more general)  1-sided strategy model </h3>

<p>
After negotiations with chief gadfly Jameson Quinn, he invented, and W.D.Smith analysed,
a more general model of 1-sided strategizing.  Actually it is a 1-parameter family of models.
The model <a href="#side1">above</a>
is a mere special case of the more general model.  Oddly enough, it turns out that the 
above special case happens to make average-based range voting seem to have
good (compared to median-based) resistance to 1-sided strategy;
whereas the whole rest of the parameter space says <b>median-based has exactly
<i>twice</i> the resistance to 1-sided strategy, versus average-based</b> range voting!!
(Albeit the special case seems of especial importance compared to most instances
of the general case.)
See that <a href="MedianAvg1side.html">analysis</a> on a separate web-page.
</p>

<h3> Can 1-sided strategy even <i>exist</i> in large real-life elections? </h3>
<p>
A lot of people are paranoid that the Evil Other Faction will think of the idea of exaggerating 
Bush&gt;Gore scores to the max, 
while your Nice Kind Faction would never think of exaggerating Gore&gt;Bush scores.
Result: horrors! disaster! Evil wins!
</p><p>
But, in reality, is this fear plausible?  Can anybody seriously imagine a vast conspiracy 
will be organized on just one side to do this, with the
other side never noticing and never doing anything about it?   Even though the whole
idea is incredibly obvious?
</p><p>
There have been thousands of large range voting style
<a href="RangePolls.html">polls</a>
conducted, and entire major governments 
(<a href="SpartaExec.html">Sparta</a>,
<a href="VeniceExec.html">Venice</a>)
have been
run with range voting for hundreds of years.
So far, in all that data, I have never seen any example of 1-sided strategizing.
[E.g. in the Bush vs Kerry US presidential election of 2004, our range exit-poll
<a href="PsEl04.html">study</a> found
no detectable difference in the fractions of pro-Bush and pro-Gore strategizers.]
I challenge the worriers to find such an example.
Balinski &amp; Laraki published an entire book on this in 2011, but were
unable to include even
a single historical example election or poll featuring 1-sided strategy!
Finally in 2015 I <a href="#RLC">participated</a> 
in a actual polling study in which massive strategy did occur... and in that study,
Balinski &amp; Laraki's "more resistant"
method malfunctioned far worse than plain average-based score voting.

If all factions maximally

then we'd get <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>.

<h3> What happens about strategy in real life? </h3>
<p>
When we actually look at real-world data from humans using average-based
and median-based range voting, what do we find? In all the cases I am
aware of so far, the voting seems similar and the election outcomes seem
similar. For example, in B&amp;L's 
<a href="OrsayTable.html">own</a> data set of 1752 voters from France 2007
there <i>obviously</i> was a huge amount of strategic voting going on since
by far the most popular score was "zero" &ndash; which also is exactly what 
happened in every (average-based) range voting study I am aware of, including our own, see e.g.<br>
<a href="Beaumont.html">/Beaumont.html</a>,<br>
<a href="RangePolls.html">/RangePolls.html</a>,<br>
<a href="PsEl04.html">/PsEl04.html</a>,<br>
<a href="French2007studies.html">/French2007studies.html</a>,<br>
<a href="France2012.html">/France2012.html</a>.
</p><p>
So claims the voters will not feel incentivized to exaggerate, were simply wrong in real life.
</p><p>
On the other hand, there also was a lot of honesty going on since
intermediate scores were very popular.
Which <i>also</i> is exactly what happened in every average-based range voting study I am aware
of, including our own.
The same finish-order 1.Bayrou, 2.Royal, 3.Sarkozy, happened with
both median-based and average-based 6-level range voting in 
Orsay <a href="France2007.html">France 2007</a>... <i>except</i> when 
Balinski &amp;
Laraki <i>corrected</i> their ballots for geographic biases (their votes came only
from Orsay, not all France) it 
<a href="French2007studies.html#aboutMJ">appears</a>
that Sarkozy wins (which was clearly 
<a href="French2007studies.html#stance">worse</a>).
</p><p>
So, while I admit this has not been a maximally-careful examination
of election data, I fail to see <i>any</i> noticeable difference in voter behavior
with median- versus mean-based range voting &ndash; or to the extent there was one, MJ was, in
Balinski &amp; Laraki's own France-2007 study, worse for France!  Also in an apparently very large
majority of real-world cases it seems both procedures elect the same winner.

<h3>Median is better when each candidate's vote-scores are tightly bunched; worse with 2 peaks</h3>
<p>
Median should enjoy clear relative advantages over average
in situations where the honest voter-opinions are <b>sharply peaked.</b>
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Median-Favoring Example:</b>
Suppose the honest scores for each candidate are <i>sharply peaked</I>
distributions, e.g. almost all
Gore scores are near 61, almost all Bush scores are near 55, etc, on an 0-99 scale.
(Say, to be concrete, almost all honest Gore scores are within 61&plusmn;2
and Bush scores within 55&plusmn;2.)
Further, suppose a goodly chunk of the voters (e.g. 25%) decide to try to throw the
election by strategically exaggerating
their opinions of Bush and Gore to 99 and 0 respectively.   
Note we are supposing all this 
exaggerating is
entirely <i>one way</i> favoring Bush.
<br><br>
I suspect both these suppositions are unrealistic.  
However, one could imagine them.
Median-based range voting then would <i>still</i> give Bush about 56 and Gore about 60,
i.e. would be almost entirely <i>immune</I> to this strategic conspiracy, <i>but</i>
mean-based range voting would succumb to it and elect Bush.
<br><br>
<i><b>But</b> if</i> these 25% of "99 &amp; 0" voters were <i>not</i> "dishonest" but in fact 
were expressing their honest opinions (for example, say the 25% are Jews and Gore has an evil plan
to kill all Jews, so the honest scores really do form a 2-peaked distribution), 
then median-based range voting would here be making a big mistake!
<br>
<img src="assets/images/OneTwoPeaked.png">
<br>
More generally, whenever there is a <b>2-peaked</b> score-distribution for some candidate, 
median is going to 
pay essentially no attention to the sizes of the two peaks (also will ignore 
the location of at least one of them) and hence will often
output a pretty crazy judgment.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Figure-skating judging</b> is an environment where these advantages-for-median
(or for "trimmed mean" range voting) seem present.
But it does not look to me like large political elections enjoy
these median-favoring features (at least, not usually).  Also
some have raised a moral objection to MJ and Trimmed Mean, which is that it is "unfair"
that they ignore minorities of extreme voters.  The moralists say that while that can be ok
for figure-skating judging (ignore corrupt unprofessional judges) but for democracy
ignoring minorities is an outrage.  ("Sorry Green Party, you are outliers so we're
going to ignore you.")
</p><p>
<b>For example</b>, in Balinski &amp; Laraki's own MJ vote data in France 2007, <i>none</i> of the
candidates had tightly bunched score-distribution, and Sarkozy (the MJ winner according
to Balinski &amp; Laraki's extrapolation
to all France) had a strongly <i>two-peaked</i> distribution (peaks at 0 and 4 on 0-5 scale).
Thus exactly this problem <i>happened</i> in Balinski &amp; Laraki's own experiment
(a fact they did not notice)! &ndash; Sarkozy 
<a href="France2007.html#aboutMJ">won</a>
with MJ, but the democratically-correct 
winner should have been Bayrou.
(Both rank-order and 33 pairwise polls all unanimously and indisputably
<a href="France2007.html">show</a> Bayrou
would have defeated Sarkozy in a two-candidate simple majority vote, indeed would
have defeated any rival X in a Bayrou-versus-X vote; also Bayrou won with
approval voting, {0,1,2} score voting, and {0,1,2,3,4,5} score voting; and finally
in retrospect later polls showed France wished Bayrou had won, e.g.
near the end of Sarkozy's term France 
preferred Bayrou&gt;Sarkozy by landslide 56-35 margin pairwise.)

<p>
So this two-peakedness problem happened in Balinski &amp; Laraki's own MJ study and caused
its failure.
</p>

<a name="unhappywithall"></a>
<H3> Another (possibly highly embarrassing) real-life strategy-related problem that hurts 
Balinski &amp; Laraki's median-based system, but not average-based range voting </H3>
<p>
It is an empirical fact that real-world range voters (with either median- or
average-based range voting) award the score 0 (zero)
far more often than any other score.  (Obviously, this is strategic.)
Hence it might happen reasonably frequently that <i>every</i> candidate gets a
<i>majority</i> of zero scores.  For example in the 
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">French 2002 presidential</a>
election (oddly enough, the election immediately prior to the one Balinski &amp; Laraki studied)
<i>every</i> one of the 16 candidates was "disapproved" by at least 63% of the voters
(if given a choice "approve" or "disapprove") and most by far more (80.3% 
overall disapproval rate).
</p><p>
<small>
The 2007 one that Balinski &amp; Laraki studied <a href="French2007studies.html">also</a>
featured majority-disapproval 
for every candidate.
</small>
</p><p>
Suppose this <b>"unhappy with all choices" scenario</b>
happens.  When it does, every candidate's median
score will be exactly zero.  (In contrast: Their <i>average</i> scores will generally
be distinct nonzero values, so for average everything will be fine.)
Hence Balinski &amp; Laraki's tiebreaking procedure will be invoked.
It will elect the candidate with the fewest 0s, which resembles
<a href="Glossary.html#antipl">antiPlurality</a> voting.
AntiPlurality is a well known exceedingly bad voting system.
<p><blockquote>
Actually, that was not a great description of the situation, so let me clarify.
In our "for each candidate, more than half the voters give him min-score"
scenario (so every candidate has median score = min-possible score),
what determines who wins in MJ?  Answer: The tiebreak rule, which is
how <i>many</i> voters burn each candidate with min-score &ndash; the
one with the fewest burns wins.
That would be exactly antiPlurality voting ("candidate named by fewest
voters wins") except that in antiPlurality each voter is allowed to name only one candidate,
while in our scenario, a voter can burn any number of candidates 
provided it's more than half of them on average. So
really this is more like "antiApproval voting."
The real fear I have with this scenario is that
the non-burn (i.e. scores that are actually informational) 
votes are completely <i>ignored</i> by MJ in this scenario &ndash; 
doesn't matter what values they had.
So you could say here MJ acted like approval (which is technically equivalent to
antiApproval) voting, but it's really more like
"approval voting with special major-deception features added" since the poor voters
will think their non-minimal scores are the things that matter, but
that perception would be exactly wrong.
They will think "if I move Hitler up from a 0 to 1 that
won't help him nearly as much as moving him to 9," but they'd be wrong.
</blockquote><p>
In this situation, any version of MJ will simply elect the candidate
with the most non-bottom votes, 
regardless of the grade of those votes. 
A candidate with 40% Ds and 60% Fs will beat a candidate with 30% As and 70% Fs.
The results of such an election might be <b>largely random</b>, or at least
hard to defend as legitimate.
</p>
<p>
It is unclear how frequent and severe this pathology will be in real life.  Balinski &amp; Laraki
only looked at one single election (where it didn't happen).   
There then was a France-wide MJ <a href="assets/documents/Sondageopinionway2012FR.pdf">poll</a>
by OpinionWay, a French polling firm, 1 year
in advance of the <a href="France2012.html">France 2012</a> presidential election. 
(1000 respondents, telephone; 12 "candidates," 7 score levels.)
In this poll, it appears that a weakened and partial version of the "unhappy with all" 
pathology <i>did</i> occur.  Specifically, MJ yielded essentially
the same results as average-based range voting, except for rightist candidate Marine Le Pen,
for whom a large discrepancy occurred.

<p>
Specifically, MJ ranked Le Pen dead last, while average-score claimed she finished 7th of the 12.
</p><p>
<b>What caused this discrepancy? And which system was better?</b>
At least naively, MJ appears to have "judged" Le Pen wrongly while average judged her
more correctly.
The reason I say that was, MJ's main claim to superiority over average is its superior
resistance to "1-sided strategy."    The reason average gave Le Pen a much
higher place, was because she had a substantial
number of supporters who rated her all along the scale (including "excellent").
MJ dismissed all of them as "exaggerating strategists," paying attention <i>only</i> to the
fact a majority of voters gave Le Pen the worst possible score "A rejeter."
But that was wrong &ndash; those Le Pen supporters were <i>not</i> "exaggerating."
They were being "honest." How do we know that? Because
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
In the real (plurality voting) election, they voted for her, even though
that was poor strategy (Le Pen had no chance to win so their vote was wasted/futile).
</li><li>
Their scores for Le Pen were spread fairly uniformly all across the scale, whereas if
they had been about strategically exaggerating, they would have all been at the extremes.
</li></ol>
<p>
(Indeed, if anything, the <i>anti</i> Le Pen faction was the one exaggerating.)
So average, correctly (in this case)
regarding those Le Pen scores as "honest," gave her credit for them
and boosted her into 7th place, while MJ wrongly ignored all those scores and rated her
with the min-possible score.  This is precisely the sort of undemocratic behavior ("ignore 
outlier minority groups such as Rightists, Jews, Greens") critics of MJ feared.
<small>
But this <i>would</i> be good for eliminating bribed figure skating judges as outliers
in the Olympics.
</small>
</p><p>
<b>In what (weakened) sense is this an instance of the present section's
"unhappy with all" pathology?</b>
Restrict attention to
the bottom half of the field of 12 candidates (which was where
the discrepancy occurred &ndash; and it was a very severe one, changing Le Pen from
<i>top</i> to <i>bottom</i> among these 6).
Then <i>all 6</i> of them were rated "A rejeter" by a large chunk of the voters.
(Only for Le Pen was that chunk actually over 50%, so this is only
an approximate and weaker version of our proposed pathology.)
As a result, MJ ignored <i>all</i> the reasonably decent scores that <i>all</i> of these
candidates received, paying attention <i>only</i> to how many "A rejeter" and "Insuffisant"
scores they got.   But that usually worked out ok (!) because
all these candidates had very similarly shaped
score-distributions, so just looking at one point of the distribution was good enough 
for comparison purposes, so MJ produced essentially the
same ordering as average.
The <i>exception</i> was Le Pen, whose distribution was shaped quite
<i>differently</i> than the other five.  
(<a href="Why99.html#aubrygraphics">pictures</a>)
And that was the reason for the discrepancy.
Note that this kind of effect could have perturbed anybody in any direction, depending
on the shape of the parts of their score distributions that MJ ignored.
In our particular case it only moved Le Pen (from top to bottom of the 6) because only
her distribution was differently shaped (e.g. largely flat with peaks at the two ends).  
But if you look at the score-distributions for the top 6 candidates
you will see that a large variety of shapes occur, e.g. Aubry 
has 
<i>three</i> large peaks,
(Sarkozy also has three peaks) etc.
</p><p>
<b>How many score levels?</b>
If we used a continuum-infinite score scale instead of Balinski &amp; Laraki's 6-point scale,
this whole problem might get even worse because Caligula could win with 55% scoring him 0
and the next 45% scoring him 0.0001, while meanwhile Jospin loses with 60% 0-scores and 40% 
100-scores &ndash; and the reason is entirely 
the single first 0.0001 score 
(which in B&amp;L's system counts the same as score 97, in this scenario).   
This suggests that, unlike for average-based range voting, making
the scale finer-grained might make B&amp;L's median-based voting behave substantially worse,
and suggests for Balinski &amp; Laraki
it may matter quite a lot <b>exactly</b> how many score levels there are.
</p><p>
What is the optimum number?  (An important question Balinski &amp; Laraki did not address.)
Might it be <a href="#MCAbenham">three</a>?
</p>

<a name="burr"></a>
<H3> Nagel's &quot;<a href="BurrDilemma.html">Burr Dilemma</a>&quot;
can favor median versus average  </H3>

<p><small>
The idea in this section is due in substantial part to Jameson Quinn, and might be very important.
</small></p>

<p>
Suppose
there is a 3-way race between candidates X, Y, and Z where Y is similar to Z.
Suppose the voters who favor Y and Z outnumber those who favor X.
With <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting, Y or Z would win 
provided the Y-or-Z-favoring voters approve <i>both</i> 
(while disapproving X) outnumbering the X-approving voters (who disapprove Y &amp; Z).
The trouble is that members of the former faction favor Y&gt;Z or Z&gt;Y slightly.
They would be tempted, to prevent the "wrong" member of {Y,Z} from winning,
to strategically disapprove him.  If enough did so, then X would win, a disaster.
</p><p>
This has been called the "Burr dilemma," albeit a perhaps better name is the "chicken dilemma."
If there were good pre-election polling indicating its likelihood, then the Y+Z faction
would recognize the problem and could try to compensate with more double-approval voting.
(Another issue would be that if those polls showed X losing, then the X-faction
would be tempted to approve the less-bad among {Y,Z} also.)
</p><p>
Now it was suggested that (average-based)
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> voting could alleviate this problem because it
would give the Y+Z faction the option of voting "X=0, Y=70, Z=100" on an 0-100 scale,
thus "more safely and honestly" indicating their Z&gt;Y preference.
But this is not a total cure.  We can easily envision a situation such as
(using 0-9 score voting)
</p>
<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>
<b>X</b> wins with average=<b>4.32</b>
versus Y and Z with 4.16 each.
</caption>
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote  </th>
</tr>
<tr><td> 26 </td><td> X=0 Y=7 Z=9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (but honestly Y=8) </td></tr>
<tr><td> 26 </td><td> X=0 Y=9 Z=7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (but honestly Z=8) </td></tr>
<tr><td> 48 </td><td> X=9 Y=0 Z=0  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
in which X wins, but really Y or Z should have won because the honest scores
would have given them average=4.42. In other words, the Burr dilemma can still
hurt average-based range voting, even with voters who only partially downgrade the
"worst member of the good pair."
</p>
<p>
But in this situation, MJ would have concluded that the <i>median</i> scores were 
X=0, <b>Y=Z=7</b> (win) and hence would <b>not have been hurt</b> by the "Burr dilemma."
So it may well be that in the presence of
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
A "Burr dilemma" situation with three main candidates where X, Y, Z with Y similar to Z
</li><li>
Voters who vote in a partly-honest and partly-strategic manner
</li><li>
(which is <i>not</i> the same thing as: some voters vote 
wholy-honestly while the remaining voters vote wholy-strategically)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
that median-based approaches will outperform average-based ones!
Warren D. Smith's old (2012 and before)  <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
computer election simulations had only considered honest+strategic voter mixtures as in (c)
where each voter flipped a constant-bias coin to decide which type to be,
and hence presumably had not experienced this Burr-effect, which happens with voter behavior (b),
which has <i>non</i>-equivalent effect for MJ voting (although equivalent for average-based 
score voting).
Indeed the "flaw" in MJ voting pointed out <a href="#partition">earlier</a> about partitioning
into districts here instead plays a <i>beneficial</i> role!
</p><p>
It would therefore be highly interesting to redo that simulation work, but this time incorporating
such internally-mixed voters (we'd need first to figure out how such voters behave).  Then
we could quantitatively assess how much this Burr effect matters and whether it is enough
to swing Bayesian Regret's judgment to favor medians.

The presidential straw <a href="RLCstrawPoll2015.html">poll</a>
at the 2015 Republican Liberty Caucus was the only known real-world poll ever conducted 
with ratings ballots known to feature massive organized strategic voting conspiracies.
</p><p>
Unfortunately for Balinski &amp; Laraki's theoretically based hopes that MJ
would defend well against strategic voters by comparison with plain average score...
actually, the opposite happened:
MJ was completely <a href="RLCstrawPoll2015.html#StratImpact">destroyed</a>
 by the strategic-voting conspiracy while
it was plain average that defended itself fairly well.

<a name="twoparty"></a>
<H3> Two-party domination? (2PD) </H3>

<p>
<a href="NESD.html">Suppose</a> all (or enough)
voters decide that A and B are the two "major party" candidates and exaggerate
to score A=max and B=min (or the reverse) in a naive attempt
to "increase the impact" of their vote.   This 
with some voting systems such as plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, 
Condorcet (with strict 
rank-orderings as votes)  and
instant runoff (IRV) <i>forces</i> either A or B always to win ("self-fulfilling prophecy").
A "third party" candidate C
can never win with this voter behavior (unless there is a perfect tie, but we shall regard
that as neglectibly unlikely).
</p><p>
This is in my opinion (and oversimplifying) the <i>reason</i> that IRV and Plurality and 
(presumably also?) Condorcet systems
lead to self-perpetuating <a href="Duverger.html">2-party domination</a> (2PD).
With 2PD, the democratic "marketplace" is severely shrunk and the fact we are 
using voting systems more
advanced than plain plurality becomes largely irrelevant.  This is a disaster.
And you need to keep in mind that his kind of naive-AB-exaggeration behavior is
very common, occurring for about 85% of Australia's voters.
</p><p>
Now with this voter behavior, even by 100% of all voters, it still remains entirely
possible for a third-party candidate to win under either  approval,
or average-based range, voting.
Thus there is hope that range voting will enable avoiding the 2PD trap.
(There is some, but <a href="NurserySumm.html">less</a>, such hope with approval voting.)
</p><p>
But with median-based range voting, this voter behavior causes one of the two major-party 
candidates to always get median=max score.  Thus the only way a third-party candidate 
can win, is if his median also equals the maximum possible score.
This intuitively seems unlikely compared to the condition (average&gt;51 using 0-100 scale) 
for a  third-party candidate to win
with average-based range voting in this kind of scenario.
</p><p>
So it seems plausible that Balinski-Laraki
voting will still fall into the 2PD democracy-destroying trap.

are often strategic but those supporting "Gore" are usually honest)

There are just two kinds of voters: "honest" and "strategic."

that could reverse this table-line!!]

There are a continuum of kinds of voters &ndash; each varies between wholy honest
to wholy strategic and can lie anywhere in between; and there is no simple way to 
classify voters into just two ("honest" vs "not") pigeonholes.

I suspect these median-favoring conditions hold substantially better for skating-judging
than for large political elections.
(And even then, 
<a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed mean</a></b>
probably is superior.)
However, it would be better if this "suspicion" and limited evidence could be replaced by 
a much greater amount of more-solid evidence. Our range-voting exit poll
<a href="PsEl04.html">study</a>
of the 2004 USA presidential election sought but
found no evidence Kerry and Bush supporters differed in how strategic they were.
</p><p>
Ordinary range voting is better than Balinski-Laraki
for (a) honest voters, or for (b)  strategizing <i>and</i> counterstrategizing
voters, or for any mixture of (a) and (b).
<i>However</i> for voters who each <i>internally</i> mix honesty with strategy, 
Balinski-Laraki could outperform average-based range voting due to
<a href="#burr">Burr dilemma</a> effect.
A simple model makes it appear
that 1-sided strategy distorts Balinski &amp; Laraki's system <i>more</i> than it distorts
ordinary range voting (contrary to Balinski &amp; my own naive intuition); see 
<a href="#fancygraph">graph</a> above &ndash; but a more 
<a href="MedianAvg1side.html">general</a> class of models reach the opposite conclusion.
