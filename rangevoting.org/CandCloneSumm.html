<H2> Candidate cloning &ndash; executive summary </H2>

<ol>
<li>
If a second candidate A, almost identical to B in the eyes of all voters, 
enters the race (or withdraws) that should neither hurt nor help
B's chances of being elected (aside
from replacement by a clone).
More precisely: "clones" in rank-order-ballot systems all are ranked adjacent by every voter.
In ratings-type systems they are all rated within &plusmn;&epsilon; by every voter in the 
limit &epsilon;&rarr;0.
</li>
<li>
But <a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a>, <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>, 
and <a href="Glossary.html#Copeland">Copeland</a> voting all hugely-fail this test.
That makes election manipulation easy (plus often
more cost-effective than "running an honest race").
</li>
<li>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range</a>
and Instant Runoff voting both pass this test ("cloneproof").
</li>
</ol>
