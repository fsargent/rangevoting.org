<H2> Approval voting in Fargo North Dakota, St.Louis Missouri, and versus IRV </H2
 <p>Warren D. Smith, Oct. 2022</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota">Fargo</a> </h2>
<p>
is the largest city in North Dakota.
In a referendum held 6 November <b>2018</b>,
Fargo decided to change their electoral system from <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
to <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting.
Fargo thus became the first city in the USA to enact Approval.
The vote was 30092 in favor of switching to approval
versus 17282 against
(64-36% among valid ballots).
This was a "landslide" margin, greater than the biggest margin in USA presidential election history.
</p><p>
<a href="FargoRefTextImage.svg">Text of the referendum-wording</a> (image from actual ballot).
</p><p>
Fargo then held its first elections (to replace 2 of its 4 city commisioners)
with the new system on 9 June 2020.
The 2 winners
John Strand and Arlette Preston
were announced that same day.
</p>
<!-- Seven candidates, 2 winners. The two winning candidates John Strand and Arlette Preston
received votes on 55% and 53% of ballots respectively.  2.3 approvals per ballot average.
Fargo uses the city commission style of local government. 
Four commissioners and a mayor are elected at large for four year terms. 
Mayor: Dr. Tim Mahoney.
Mahoney took the role of acting mayor on 2 December 2014, when Mayor Dennis Walaker died in office.
Mahoney then won a special election for the balance of Walaker's second term on 28 April 2015.
He ran unopposed for a full term on 12 June 2018.
He is a member of the Democratic Party. -->
<p>
Fargo's first <i>mayoral</i> election with the new system came on 14 June <b>2022</b>.
<small>There also were 15 candidates running for the two open Council seats, won by
Denise Kolpack and Dave Piepkorn with 42.5% and 38.7% approval, respectively.
(Mean #approvals per voter: 3.07.)</small>
<!-- two spots for City Commission came in at a close race with Denise Kolpack taking almost 14% of the approvals
     and current City Commissioner Dave Piepkorn taking 12.63%. -->

  -->
</p><p>
But we'll only discuss the Mayoral race.
It involved 7 candidates on ballot, exceeding Fargo's previous record high 6.
Dr. Tim Mahoney won (re-elected)
despite his rival Shannon Roers Jones dwarfing the other mayoral candidates in fundraising
with almost $121,000.
(The next biggest fundraisers in the mayoral race were Dabar with about $32,000 and Mahoney with about $29,500.)
<!--according to a campaign finance disclosure statement that was due from all candidates by May 13 at the City Auditor's Office. -->
The previous time Mahoney had run for mayor, he'd been unopposed.

<p>
This seems to have been a success. Election results were announced the next day.
The mean number of approvals 1.59 was compatible with, say,
41% approve-1 and 59% approve-2 ballots (not that I am claiming that was the distribution;
I do not know the distribution and it also could have been, e.g, 60%, 21%, and 19% for approve-1, 2, and 3)
which was considerably greater voter expression than old plurality-style
voting for only 1.
It was enough to get Mahoney majority-approval, a feat achieved by nobody else.
If the voters <a href="HowManyApprove.html#NoHopers">regarded</a>
the election as a race between Mahoney, Preston, and Roers Jones
with the other 4 regarded as clearly worse and without hope of winning, and with the "Big Three" having
random numbers (sampled independently from some even-symmetric density)
as utilities, then the voters'
<a href="HowManyApprove.html">optimum strategy</a> would be
to approve the above-average among the "big three" i.e. 1.5 approvals per voter on average (and always either 1 or 2).
If, however, it was "big four" not "big three," then
optimum voting strategy would involve 2 approvals per voter on average and always 1, 2, or 3.
These oversimplified models of Fargo's situation in fact produced predictions corresponding decently to reality (namely 1.59)
suggesting Fargo's voters "got smart fast" about how to approval-vote intelligently.
</p><p>
The hope that approval would decrease the influence of <b>cash</b>
on elections (by decreasing the usefulness of &ndash; through very expensive "conspicuous consumption" &ndash;
showing you "had among the top 2 best chances to win"
to convince voters that plurality-style votes for you would not be "wasted")
seems validated by the fact the big money was not generating big approval.
</p><p>
The hope that approval would inspire more candidates to enter the race
was validated by this being the greatest number (7) in Fargo history.
</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis">St.Louis</a></h2>
is the largest city in Missouri.
In a referendum held 3 Nov. <b>2020</b>,
it enacted 2-winner approval voting for primaries, followed up by 2-contender general elections,
for city seats such as mayor, comptroller, and Board of Aldermen.
The ballot "proposition D" enacting Approval won by
87369-40833 (as a percentage 68.15 to 31.85%), an even greater landslide than in Fargo,
and also got endorsements from The League of Women Voters, the city's largest newspaper,
SEIU, the "Organization for Black Struggle," and many elected officials of all viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Ballot question:</b> "Shall the City of St. Louis adopt an ordinance to:
</p><ul><li>
    establish an open, non-partisan system for elections to the offices of Mayor, Comptroller, President of the Board of Aldermen, and Alderman
  </li><li>
    enable voters to choose <i>all</i> the candidates they wish in the open, non-partisan primary
  </li><li>
    allow the top two candidates to then compete in a runoff general election?"
</li></ul>
<p>
There also was a more detailed write-up not printed on the ballot, but available to referendum voters.
</p><p>
St.Louis's first election witb the new system came on 2 March <b>2021</b>.
<!--    featured 29.9% voter turnout, almost as large as the year-2017 (record high for odd-numbered year) turnout of 30.12%,
despite Missouri not extending COVID absentee-voting laws ?? -->
The mayoral primary via approval voting was to choose two finalists from a field of four candidates.
Reed had raised the most money as of 22 Feb. with
over $531,000, followed by
T.Jones ($456,000) and Spencer ($432,600),
with A.Jones far behind with only $19,468, most of it contributed by himself.
The approval primary's winners were Tishaura Jones and Cara Spencer.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tishaura_Jones#Mayor_of_St._Louis_(2021–present)#Mayor_of_St._Louis_(2021–present)">Jones</a>
then won the 6 April general election over Spencer by 30166-27865,
<!-- note (30166/27865)*(20659/25388.) = 0.880926 -->
thus becoming St. Louis' first African-American female mayor.
The 44571 voters approved an average of 1.56 candidates.
That was enough to get Jones majority-approval, a feat achieved by nobody else,
correctly making it seem likely she'd win the later general election.
The results were announced the next day:
</p><table bgcolor="pink">
  <tr bgcolor="yellow"><th>Candidate</th><th>Approvals</th><th>As percentage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>TISHAURA JONES</td><td>25388</td><td>56.96%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CARA SPENCER</td><td>20659</td><td>46.35%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LEWIS REED</td><td>17186</td><td>38.56%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ANDREW JONES</td><td>6428</td><td>14.42%</td></tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightgreen"><td>(TOTAL)</td><td>69661</td><td>156.3%</td></tr>
</table>
<!-- Total voters 44571, ratio=69661/44571=1.563, turnout=44571/201352=22.136% -->
<p>
Again this seems to have been a "success," based on the same reasons as Fargo.
</p><p>
If the 4 candidates had had random numbers (selected independently from an even-symmetric density)
as their utilities for each voter
(an ultra-simplified model of the situation) then that voter's optimal strategy would have been
to approve the candidates with <i>above-average</I> utility, which on average would be 2 approvals per voter.
If however the "big three" were regarded by voters as having such random utilities while A.Jones was regarded by
all voters as clearly less desirable and with no hope to win, <i>then</i> the optimum approval-voting strategy would be
to approve the above-average members of the big three, while leaving A.Jones unapproved.
Then you'd be approving only 1.5 candidates, on average.
These predictions by over-simplified models in fact correspond well to what actually happened, which was
1.56 approvals per voter on average.  So it would appear that St.Louis voters "got smart" about
approval voting fast &ndash; at least based on this single election-datapoint.
</p>  
<h2>3. Some confused and wrong propaganda spread by Steven Hill (and Don Saari...) about "bullet voting" </h2>

<p>
Hill in 2022 wrote, in an attempt to influence <a href="SeattleOpEd2.html">Seattle-2022</a>
voters against approval by attacking the success of Approval Voting in Fargo:
</p><blockquote>
  For Fargo's mayoral election in June 2022, an opinion poll estimated that 60%
  of voters "bullet voted" (i.e. approved exactly one), despite there being seven candidates
  &ndash; meaning voters could vote up to seven times, once for each of those seven candidates &ndash;
  voters approved an average of just 1.5.  [Actually it was 1.59, Hill rounded wrong.]
</blockquote><p>
Hill then continued, trying similarly to attack St.Louis:
</p><blockquote>
  In St. Louis, we see a similar story.
  For its mayoral primary in March 2021 using approval voting, two finalists were selected
  from a field of four candidates. In the old pre-approval system, voters had a single vote.
  But in the approval voting election, despite voters having four approvals to use, voters
  approved an average of only 1.6 candidates.   [This time Hill rounded 1.56 correctly.]
</blockquote><p>  
Then Hill helpfully explained what he claimed was the reason for that:
</p><blockquote>
  Another study found that 24% of voters said that the reason they approved of only one candidate was because they
  feared that voting for more than one would hurt their favorite candidate's chances.
  Fargo candidates quickly figured out this bullet voting dynamic, because it just makes practical sense when
  running under the rules of approval voting. So candidates began instructing their voters accordingly.
  Incumbent mayor Tim Mahoney during his reelection campaign said "I would probably bet that every candidate says just vote once."
  One of his challengers, Republican state representative Shannon Roers Jones, agreed saying,
  "It will be important for me to convey to people... that the most effective way to elect the person
  they care about is to vote only for that person." Election administrator Mike Montplaisir, who runs Fargo's
  elections, said that he also "voted for only one candidate &ndash; the candidate I wanted to win &ndash; because
  voting for anyone else is like taking a vote away from [my first choice]." He added, "You can game the system."
</blockquote><p>
Those quotes demonstrate that Steven Hill, in addition to being a professional propagandist, also is an idiot.
The reality is that we  <a href="HowManyApprove.html">understand</a> correct approval-voting strategy
quite well and have for 40 years.
Hill, however, never learned that, since reading and understanding voting theory just is not what he does.
</p><p>
And that correct theory tells us that sometimes "bullet voting" is a strategically good idea, and sometimes it is not.
For example, suppose you, as a Fargo voter, liked Dabar best and Mahoney 2nd best.
Were you well advised by the "experts" Hill and Montplaisir to approve Dabar <i>only</i>?
Of course not.  That would be the act of an idiot.  Dabar had virtually no chance to win.
The real battle was between Mahoney and Preston;
and by following Hill's completely wrong advice you would merely <i>idiotically sacrifice</i> nearly 100% of
your power as a voter to decide the election winner.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if your favorite candidate was Mahoney or Preston (presumably true for roughly 61% of Fargo's voters),
then "bullet voting" <i>could</i> well have been a strategically-sensible move.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the voters in Fargo and St.Louis were smarter than those so-called experts, i.e. Fargo ignored
their wrong advice and instead cast ballots which, at least as far as I can tell from the aggegrated statistics,
closely resemble optimal approval-voting strategy.
(If I had the full ballot-set, which I do not, then I could analyse this matter more deeply.)
</p><p>
The correct theory tells us that the strategically-correct number of "hoper" candidates for a voter
to approve is on average going to be about C<sub>hope</sub>/2 or a bit less, where
C<sub>hope</sub> is the number of candidates with realistic hopes to win.
Plus, if there are "no-hopers" you prefer over the expected value of the winner among the hopers, approve them too.
In Fargo C<sub>hope</sub>&asymp;2 to 3, so we expect an average voter to approve 1 to 1.5 hopers, <i>plus</i>
all the no-hopers they like best (if any), which would add at least 0.4 approvals per voter on average.
In net we expect (1 to 1.5)+0.4 approvals, i.e. 1.4 to 1.9.
And in fact Fargo delivered 1.59 approvals per voter, entirely as expected.
In short: Hill produced no evidence whatever that anything went wrong in Fargo.  He merely cast aspersions
to sow fear and doubt (a classic propaganda technique) but with no legitimate underlying basis for them.
</p><p>
And <i>did</i> anything go wrong in Fargo?
No.  Fargo produced one winner &ndash; Mahoney &ndash; with a massive landslide 65% approval rate,
and all his rivals had &le;35% approval each, i.e. a massively clear demonstration that Mahoney was the right
winner while the others were not.
Approval Voting <i>succeeded</i> in making that essentially as massively clear as we could
possibly hope for.
</p><p>
The fact that 1.59 was about the "right" average number of approvals per Fargo voter was demonstrated by this success.
If all voters had, say, cast only 1 approval as Hill foolishly recommended, then we probably would have wound up with Mahoney getting about
41% approval and still winning, but it would <i>not</i> have been massively clear Mahoney was the "right" winner because
neither he nor anybody else would have enjoyed majority support.  If Fargo had gone in the other direction with, say, 2.5 approvals per voter,
then we likely would have wound up with <i>two</i> majority-approved candidates, in which case, again, it would have
been less-clear Mahoney was the right winner.
</p><p>
In St.Louis (for which as a 2-stage "approval <i>plus</i> 2-woman-runoff" election, actually the plain-approval strategy-theory did not
apply, but this process was <i>approximated</i> by plain approval &ndash; especially since the runoff had "no effect," i.e. merely re-delivered
the same winner as stage 1 &ndash; hence its strategy also was <i>approximately</i> the same)
C<sub>hope</sub> again was 2 or 3,
and the theory predicts 1 to 1.5 approvals per average voter for "hoper" candidates, plus another 0.14 additional approvals
per voter for the no-hoper A.Jones (plus some for the no-hoper Reed, if you, rather debatably, consider him a no-hoper).
Again, the reality (1.56) agreed fine with the prediction (1.14 to 1.7).
And again the fact that 1.56 was about the "right" average number of approvals per St.Louis voter was demonstrated by this
<i>success</i> of St.Louis in producing exactly one majority-approved winner (T.Jones with 57%)
with all her rivals getting &le;46% each.
</p><p>
Again, Approval Voting <i>succeeded</i> in making the "correctness" of its winner essentially as massively clear as we could
possibly hope for, and the <i>reason</i> it did so was because the St.Louis voters approved just about the <i>optimally right</i>
average number of approvals per ballot.  If they'd approved 1.08 times more, or 1.14 times fewer, then St.Louis would not
have enjoyed a unique majority-approved winner, and that clarity would have been lost.
</p><p>
Notice: in <i>both</i> Fargo and St.Louis, the voters automagically optimized their average number of approvals
with <b>&plusmn;3%</b> or better relative accuracy!  Impressed? I am.
</p><p>
<b>Approval voting, if the voters employ
optimum strategy, <i>automatically</i> tends to produce a <i>unique</i> majority-approved winner.</b>
(We warn you this is only a tendency, not a guarantee.  But it worked in Fargo &amp; St. Louis.)
This fact (which is a consequence of the <a href="HowManyApprove.html">theory</a>)
allows you to tell almost immediately whether the voters in any given approval-voting election
cast about the right average number of approvals,
or whether they were fools like Hill.
</p><p>
Fargo and St.Louis' voters just naturally exhibited nearly optimal
behavior, despite all the wrong advice Hill et al tried to spoon-feed them.
</p><p>
To summarize: Hill's entire complaint here was wrong-headed.  If he'd ever read approval voting theory he'd
have known that 40 years before he unwisely opened his mouth.  And then the facts  in Fargo and St.Louis conclusively
refuted Hill's wrongness.  Which he was too stupid to notice even then.
This all is a <i>success</i> for Approval, and Hill in no way even came close to demonstrating anything wrong.
All he did was sow fear and doubt.  (But probably that was his goal, as opposed to any sort
of voter education or theoretical or experimental correctness.)
</p>
  
  
<h2>4. Is Approval Voting more popular than Instant Runoff in USA? </h2>
<p>
Those landslide <b>64-36</b> and <b>68-32</b> margins for enacting approval in the USA's first two referenda on
the matter ever (mean 66-34) are quite reassuring.
It is interesting to compare them versus large referenda held contemporaneously in the USA trying instead
to enact Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) or variants.
</p>
<table>
  <tr bgcolor="lightblue"><th>Place &amp; Date</th><th>Margin for (or against, if second number greater) enacting IRV</th></tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightgreen"><td>Maine (Question 5) 8 Nov. 2016</td><td>52.12-47.88%, enacted</td></tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightgreen"><td>New York City (Question 1) 5 Nov. 2019</td><td>510153-182900 (73.61-26.39%), enacted</td></tr>
  <tr bgcolor="pink"><td>Massachusetts (Question 2) 3 Nov. 2020</td><td>1549919-1877447  (45.22-54.78%), defeated</td></tr>
  <tr bgcolor="lightgreen"><td>Alaska (measure 2) 3 Nov.2020</td><td>174032-170251  (50.55-49.45%), enacted</td></tr>
      <!--  <tr><td>PlaDa</td><td>Margin</td></tr> -->
  <tr bgcolor="yellow"><td>AVERAGE PERCENT</td><td>55.4-44.6%</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is not enough data for statistical significance, but as far as it goes it suggests approval voting is more popular
than the largest popular-vote-margin (24%) US presidential victories ever, which in turn are
more popular than IRV, which finally is about equally popular as 
the <i>average</i> US presidential victory margin of 10.5%
<!-- 10.47 = (26.2+25.2+17.4+17.8+24.3+9.9+7.5+4.4+10.5+15.4+0.2+22.6+0.7+23.2+2.1+9.7+18.2+7.8+5.6+8.5-0.5+2.4+7.2+3.7-2.0+4.45)/26 -->
during 1920-2020.
</p><p>
And there is <a href="WhatVotersWant.html">evidence</a> that 10-level
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> would, if offered,
be even more popular than approval.
</p><hr><p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle">Seattle</a></h2>
the largest city in Washington and 18th largest in the USA,
on 8 Nov.2022 will   <a href="SeattleOpEd2.html">vote</a> in what, as far as I can tell, is the world's first-ever referendum
offering voters a <i>choice</i> between Approval and Instant Runoff systems
(or staying with Seattle's status quo, involving Plurality voting).
That will be quite interesting.
