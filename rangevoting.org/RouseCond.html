Michael Rouse's idea for making Condorcet &amp; Borda voting secure using Rivest's 3ballot plan
</H2>

<p><small>By Michael A. Rouse &amp; Warren D. Smith</small></p>

<H3> Summary </H3>
<p>
Michael Rouse, in a 2 October Electorama post,  figured out how to apply 
<a href="Rivest3B.html">Rivest's &quot;3ballot&quot; secure voting idea</a>
for use in <a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a> and <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
rank-order ballot voting methods.
However, the Rouse-Rivest scheme is very vulnerable to the "selected pattern attack"
and hence cannot be regarded as providing protection against vote-buying and coercion in 
elections with a large number of candidates.
<small>If C!&gt;V where C is the number of candidates and V the number of voters,
then the Rouse-Rivest scheme is severely affected by this attack. If C!&lt;&lt;V then
it is only mildly affected.
</small>
</p>

<H3> Rouse's idea </H3>
<p>
One authentic ballot, one random (or voter-picked) order, and one the reverse
of that order.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say my true preference is A>B>C. Some political
operative wants to buy the vote B>A>C. I would simply pick the following:
</P>
<table bgcolor=lightyellow align="center"><tr><td>
<pre>
Ballot 1: A>B>C (true preference)
Ballot 2: B>A>C ("bought" vote)
Ballot 3: C>A>B (reverse of "bought" vote)
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Now, I can choose to copy ballot 2 and bring it to the buyer/coercer 
as my "proof." I can pick any order I want
for ballot 2, and simply reverse that order for ballot 3. (Of course, I can
put the fake and reverse-fake ballots at any position I want and my
"true" ballot in the remaining position.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, it would be rather tedious. If it were a computer/printer
combination, we could have a selection that would automatically randomize
one ballot and reverse this for another, and then print out the triplet.
(But the voter would have to <i>trust</i> that machine and that randomness,
so this is probably a bad idea.)
</p>

<H3> How the "specified pattern attack" hurts the Rouse-Rivest plan </H3>

<p>
The attacker (vote buyer or coercer) says to the voter
(in a 33-candidate race like the Congo September 2006 presidential race)
<blockquote>
I want you to vote A>B>C>...>Z as your 'true' vote,
and X>Q>F>...>B and its reverse as your 'fake' vote.
</blockquote>
<p>
There are 33!  possible kinds of votes (which far exceeds the population of the Congo),
so the coercer can uniquify easily.  Then the coercer, if he does not see all three
demanded patterns posted on the bulletin board, exacts horrific
punishment on the voter.
</p>
<p>
This is an excellent illustration of the tremendous devastation the
"3-pattern attack"
(also called the "selected pattern attack") can wreak.
But in <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> and 
<a href="AppExec.html">approval</a> voting, all candidate scoring decisions are independent
and can be on separate "ballots" so there <i>is no</i> pattern, so for those
voting systems (and apparently those alone), the selected pattern attack is 
simply not a problem.
With 
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>,
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>, and
<a href="Plurality.html">Plurality</a> voting,
etc, the individual candidate-scores <i>depend</I> and hence <i>cannot</i> 
be separated
without making ballot-validity-checking impossible.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Attempts to fix this by separating the rank order ballot A>B>C>D>... into A>B, B>C, C>D
etc don't work because they omit the implied A>C, A>D, B>D, etc relations.
Attempts to fix it by making the voter vote individually on all possible candidate-pairs
runs into the problem that there are an enormous number of candidate-pairs (990 in
a 45-candidate election) &ndash; far too much information to reasonably ask voters to provide
&ndash; and also the candidate-pair decisions again <i>depend</i> on each other,
e.g. if you say A>B and B>C you are not allowed to say C>A.    Anytime a voting
system features such dependence, the ballot validity check becomes complicated
because, in a 45-candidate election, it needs to examine all 45*3=135 individual
chunks of information (or more).   Whenever it is complicated, a computer is
probably needed, destroying the whole Rivest idea of allowing computers to be <i>avoided</i>,
and also
raising the horrible possibility (probably very easily possible with future computer technology)
that computer is <i>remembering</i> the 3ballots, which would also completely destroy
the Rivest 3ballot scheme's claim that undetected
cheating by the election counters would be impossible.
Whenever a large "bundle" of dependent-information is needed in a vote because
of the definition of the voting system (such as in
rank-order ballots, or in plurality ballots) the very size of the bundle makes it
possible for a voter to "insert a lot of information" into his 3ballot, which
enables the selected-pattern attack.  
<a href="AppExec.html">Approval</a> 
and
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> 
voting, and them alone among commonly proposed voting methods, avoid
that difficulty because all the chunks of information in their votes are <i>independent</i>.
