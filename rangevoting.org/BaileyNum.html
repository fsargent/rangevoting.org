Scientific and technological innovation has historically occurred at
a much greater rate (over 10&times; larger)  in democracies than non-democracies.

<H3>Capitalism vs. Communism </H3>
<blockquote>
Under capitalism, man exploits man. 
Under communism, it's just the opposite. 
&ndash; John Kenneth Galbraith
</blockquote>
<p>
During 1945-1990, the cumulative
effect was that by 1990 productivity per worker in 
E.Germany had shrunk to about <i>half</i> that in W.Germany,
representing the compounded effect of economic growth being
additively 1.5%/year smaller.

This is taken from <a href="RVPapers.html">Bailey's book</a>.

<H3>  Efficiency of government </H3>
<p>
Bailey (an economist) estimates that USA Government spending gets 50 cents
value per dollar spent, for "50% waste."
(This estimate is necessarily rather crude.  He has numerous examples in chapter 1
summarized on his page 13 in table 1.3.)
If so, improved systems for military spending decisions, farm subsidies, medicare, etc etc
could improve the economy by a lot, because the US Government
taxes and spending  (if we include all state and 
local governments and Social Security) 
constitute
30-35% of the USA's GDP.
</p>

<p>
<i>
The above estimates suggest that very considerable economic
improvement could be possible  by changing the sort of government we have.

<H3>Economic Value of Democratization</H3>
<a name=Rummel></a>
<blockquote>
During this [the 20th] century's wars, there were some 38 million battle deaths,
but almost four times more people &ndash; at least 170 million &ndash;
were killed by governments for ethnic, racial, tribal,
religious, or political reasons. I call this phenomenon
democide, and it means that authoritarian and totalitarian
governments are more deadly than war.
&ndash; <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/PERSONAL.HTM">R.J.Rummel</a>, 
author of <i>Death by Government</i>
<blockquote>
See also Rummel's 
<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/">&quot;power kills&quot; web site</a>
and his
<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE5.HTM">statistics of democide</a> notes.
Rummel's current estimates are higher than this quote.  One of Rummel's points
is that democide deaths far outnumber (by a factor&gt;4) both
ordinary war deaths 
and ordinary homicide deaths.  
Another is that nearly 99% of
democide deaths occur 
in non-democracies.  Rummel also cites data from, e.g. Richard Pride indicating democracies
do not war with each other, or very rarely.
<small>
By Pride's definition of "democracy," during 1920-1965 there were
1540 dyads of countries with 192 having wars ("war" defined as &gt;1000
combat deaths) and 91 involving a democracy, but none
were between democracies.   
</small> 
<!-- South Africa highest homicide rates in 2000 with 50 per 100K, Russia 2nd with 21, 
Lithuania 3rd with 10.  USA 6th with 5.64.
"International Comparisons of Criminal Justice Statistics 2000".
These make it seem like gun availability might have a lot to do with it...
With whole world at SA rates would be 3.2million/year homicides
worldwide which for the 1900-2000 century (taking account of pop growth) would be about
200million.   However, world has much lower rates than SA, median is around 2 not 50?
If so, then not 200million that century but only 8million.  Since distn is skewed truth is
maybe rate of 10 per 100K in which case 40million. -->

<p>
Here is table 1.2 (page 5) of Bailey's book
attempting to exhibit the effect of democratization on the economies of four countries.
<!--
Bailey made this table about 4 countries.  (Unfortunately I have forgotten the names of
the countries he had in mind; have to recheck his book.  
I have added a column for Chile which in 1990
got rid of the Pinochet military dictatorshp
that ruled from 1973-1990, and which enjoyed 8% real GDP growth during 1991-1997
although with a slump 1998-2003 and recovery 2004-2005.)
Between 1973 and 1999, real GDP in Mauritius grew 5.9% per year average, 
compared with 2.4% for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.

<p>
This by itself, however, is <i>unconvincing</i> evidence that democracy is economically good.
I say that because
<ol>
<li>
This are only 4 datapoints, and Bailey might have cherry-picked his data.
</li><li>
Even if this data is genuinely a random sample, still it only
yields a low-confidence (93%) conclusion.
</li><li>
Bailey's dates for the "switchovers" are highly debatable.
</li></ol>
Much more convincing are the far larger studies by Barro and Vanhanen that we shall now discuss.
</p>


<a href="BarroGDPfit.html"><img src="BarroPlot.png" width="527" height="697" 
alt="Barro's democracy vs GDP growth-rate plot" hspace="10"></a>

<a href="BarroPlot.jpg">(jpg version of same picture)</a>

<p>
<a href="RVPapers.html">Barro's book</a>
attempts to predict the growth rate of a country's real GDP 
from various facts about that country.
Barro found that GDP growth is enhanced by:
<ul>
<li> 
low <i>initial</i> per capita real
GDP in a country (then technology transfer causes fast growth; this
appears to be the biggest effect in Barro's list)
</li><li> 
more secondary and higher levels of schooling, 
</li><li> 
longer life expectancy (which presumably means good health)
</li><li> 
lower fertility rates, 
</li><li> 
lower government expenditures as a GDP fraction
</li><li> 
more "rule of law"
</li><li> 
favorable trade relations with other countries (e.g. the USA made trade with Cuba
illegal, which severely hurt the Cuban economy) 
</li><li> 
high inflation (over 20% annually) kills economic growth
</li><li> 
<i>Democracy</i>.
</ul>

<p>
<i>But</i> democracy increases GDP in a somewhat peculiar way (pictured):
increases in Barro's  political rights index from 0 to 5.6 on a scale of 0-10
(yielding a moderate level of freedom and democracy)
increased GDP growth rates additively by 2.6% 
<i>but</i> a further increase in the index from 5.6 to 10
<i>retarded</i> growth by <i>negative</i> 1.6%.
</p>

<p>
All of Barro's causative
factors (listed) cause approximately equal additive effects on predicted
real-GDP-growth-rate,
namely about 2-5% each.  That is, having the optimum level 5.6 of political rights
causes about 2.6% higher (additively) annual GDP growth rate than the pessimal
level 0;  countries about one standard deviation above usual in education levels are
predicted to have about 3% higher than usual annual-GDP-growth;
etc.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, compound interest will convert these into enormous eventual prosperity
differences, which is
an important reason why  rich countries are tremendously richer than poor ones.
</p>

<p>
Another book-length study based on least-squares fitting
is <a href="RVPapers.html">Vanhanen's</a>.  (And it is even bigger
than Barro's study, employing over 170 countries.)  
The difference is that while Barro
focuses on finding factors that cause increased GDP growth rate, Vanhanen focuses on
factors causing increased democracy.
</p>

<p>
The two are related; thus Vanhanen finds that
more education (especially early education, according to p.68 of Barro)
and more prosperity 
both cause more democracy.
Thus Vanhanen's plot on p.77 of his "Prospects" book
shows GNP/capita predicts index of democracy
<i>highly</i> effectively (year 1991 data, 172 countries, correlation is 0.62).
The UN's "human development index" also is an excellent predictor
of democracy-index (plot p.79; correlation=0.67).
</p>

<p>
A correlation is not the same thing as a certainty so
democracy does not force a good economy.  For example, China is doing better than India
economically.  But on average, democracy is a superb correlate.
Vanhanen's key umbrella finding is that <i>wider distribution of power resources</i>
is the key enabling factor for democracy.  <small>(In particular, we might expect from
this that greater concentration of wealth, i.e. greater  inequality as measured
by "Gini index," would predict and cause a diminution of democracy.
However, Barro p68-72 finds only a very small correlation [0.02] &ndash;
Gini index is not a good enough gauge for Vanhanen's purposes.)</small>
</p>

<H3> Why that peaking and downturn? </H3>

<p>
Advocates of democracy should be distressed that further increases in democratic political
rights make the economy worse.
The initial upward trend of the curve makes a great deal of sense to them &ndash; but
<i>why</i> the downturn?
</p>

<p>
<b>Barro</b>
tries to explain it by postulating that
more democracy causes more government income redistribution, which hurts growth.
However, that explanation is <b>attackable</b> because
Barro's fit <i>already</i> had incorporated government
expenditures
as a <i>different</i> predictor, and democratization was only being fit to
the <i>unexplained</i> part of the GDP growth above and beyond that explainable
as a result of government outlays.
In other words we are predicting the effect of democratization on
GDP growth with
<i>government purchases held constant</i>.  (Also educational attainment and life expectancy
are also held fixed, which also are related somewhat to government outlays;
and everything else Barro looks at, such as initial GDP/capita, also is held fixed.) 
Barro partially
defends himself by saying that government <i>transfer</i> payments were <i>not</i> 
held constant.
But, assuming Barro has in mind the
idea that the transfers aim toward <i>equalizing</i> wealth,
he is exactly <i>wrong</i> about its economic effect: 
the <a href="RVPapers.html">Deininger-Squires 1998 World Bank cross-country
study</a>
found that greater initial inequality is strongly <i>negatively</i> correlated
to future economic growth!
</p>

<p>
<small>
In other words, the "trickle down theory" often associated with Ronald Reagan
is wrong.
And according to
George R. G. Clarke:
More Evidence on Income Distribution and Growth,
J. Development Economics 47,2 (Aug. 1995) 403-427,
"This conclusion is robust across different inequality measures,
and to many different specifications of the growth regression.
Furthermore, inequality appears to have a negative effect on
<i>both</i> democracies and non-democracies.
Interaction terms between inequality and regime type, when included in the
base regression, do not affect the sign or significance of [this]."
So this seems to settle the matter. (However, to <i>completely</i> clarify matters,
it would be good to put transfer payments into Barro's fit also, to see what happens.
And two other good predictors to try inserting would be a country's winter temperature
and the "centralization fraction" of its government 
[See A.Lijphart: <i>Democracies</i> 1984 table 10.2 page 178].)
</small>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, let us propose <b>some new explanatory hypotheses</b> that we think more
supported than Barro's:
<ol type="a">
<li> 
More democracy &rarr; dumb people make more dumb decisions &rarr; worse economic growth.
</li> 
<li> 
Even smart people make dumb decisions if the "decision-making algorithm" is "a poor
voting system."  If so, then replacing the voting system with a better one, such
as <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, would yield
a big  economic growth win, and that peak &amp; downturn
might be avoidable &ndash; the curve instead would just keep going up!
</li> 
</ol>
It is very important to decide if a or b (or Barro's original hypothesis) is correct.
<small>(Or Barro, a, and b all might be partially correct.)</small>
If b is correct, then the economic growth win attainable by switching to
Range Voting (or in some other way improving the voting system; see picture) would
appear to be <i>greater than attainable by altering any other factor</i> identified by Barro,
and also it would be much <i>easier</i> to change the voting system than to alter
any of those other factors.
</p>


<p>
<font color="red">
In other words, quite possibly, <b>Range Voting</b>
would lead to a greater economic win, i.e. a greater
improvement in humanity's lot, than anything else Barro could identify, and it would be
an easier change to make too.
</font>
</p>

<p>
Hello.
</p>

<p>
Our <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret study</a> predicts
that switching from <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> to 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> will bring benefits
<a href="UniqBest.html#HugePos">comparable</a>
to those got from switching from non-democratic systems modeled by "random winner"
to plurality-voting democracy.  
This study was totally independent of Barro's and used entirely different (non-economic,
computer simulation based) methods.
That <i>also</i> predicts a <b>huge win</b> from adopting Range Voting.
</p>

<H3> Can we support that with a cross-country study? </H3>

<p>
It would be good to do a cross-country study trying to measure the economic impacts of
different kinds of voting systems.  This would be deeper than merely considering
"democratic" versus "not."
However, at present, few such studies have  been 
done, focused mainly in the question of which is better: 
<a href="PropRep.html">Proportional Representation</a> or
"majoritarian" democracy &ndash; and mainly 
with <a href="PropRep.html#econ">inconclusive conclusions</a>.
(Also see <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p14">problem 14</a>.)
</p>

<a name="qol"></a>
<p>
One very interesting study was the 2005 <a href="QoL2005.html">quality of life survey</a> 
by <i>The Economist</i> magazine
(<a href="QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf">more extensive pdf</a>).  
This study tried to estimate, not just how wealthy
a country was, but (which is related but not the same) the <i>quality of life</i> for
its inhabitants.  (See the links for how that was estimated and defined.)
It found the top 10 countries were (in decreasing-quality order)
Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, 
Australia, Iceland, Italy, Denmark, and Spain.
(The USA, Canada, and Qatar, 
were ranked 13, 14, and 41; they did not make it into the top quality-of-life
10 despite GDP/capita ranks of #2, #5, and #6 respectively.)
What do the top-10 have in common?
<ol>
<li>
All are democracies.
</li><li>
None are 2-party-dominated, i.e. all have powerful third 
parties in at least some branches of their government.
(But the US and Canada are 2-party dominated, and Qatar is a non-democracy.)
</li><li>
The top two &ndash; Ireland and Switzerland &ndash; both are "advanced design" democracies
and rose to their current top status from what
can only be described as very humble and unhappy beginnings
(at the beginnings of those democracies) and despite having
very unimpressive natural resources.
</li><li>
They (on average) seem to be "more PR" than the average democracy (while the USA &amp; Canada are
far "less PR" than average).
</li>
</ol>
This suggests to me that advanced-design, <i>not</i> 2-party-dominated democracy
is a very good idea, and perhaps PR is a good idea too.  On the other hand, you have to buy
into <i>The Economist's</i> definition of "quality of life," otherwise their whole study and
every conclusion following from it, loses interest.
</p>
<p>
The fact that neither PR nor non-PR (mainly plurality-voting-based)
democracies exhibit obvious economic superiority
over the other suggests that a democracy based on <i>range voting</i> could
be significantly superior to either.
