<p>
Nashua NH, 8-11 Oct. 2015.  Straw 
poll conducted for RLC by Center for Election Science.
&asymp;777 voters.
Sample ballot below 
which we've here
filled in with the poll results.
(See also: actual ballot image <a href="RLC2015_ballot250.jpg">jpg</a>.)
</p><p>
<small>
The blue-green "mean rating" column and "total" row
of course were not actually present on the ballots;
we have added them for results-display purposes.  
The boxes
on each ballot were either  left empty or checked (&checkmark;) by voters;
we here have filled each box with the percentage of voters who marked that box.
The rating "_" was not included on the ballots, which of course only allowed
0,1,2,3,4,5 as ratings; we have included the "_" column to count voters
who left those all <i>blank</i> i.e. did not provide any numerical rating
for that candidate.  
We counted blanks as 0 for purpose of determining score-voting winners.

<b>The ordering</b> of the candidates shown was not the same as that on
the preprinted ballots
(<a href="RLC2015_ballot250.jpg">jpg</a>)
because for display purposes we have reordered the lines to sort them
into descending order reckoned by approval count.
</p>
<p>
<b>Voters and winners:</b>
There were 776 plurality voters, defined as ballots containing at least one vote
for at least one candidate.
There were 779 approval voters,
defined as ballots approving at least one candidate.
There were 769 score voters,
defined as ballots scoring at least one candidate nonzero; their mean score 
(on-ballot candidates only) was 0.95 on an 0-to-5 range.
Rand Paul won reckoned by any of our three voting systems (all agreed).

<p>
<b>The 16 candidates</b>
polled here were the 15 
Republican contenders who'd participated in televised debates up til then,
plus Mark Everson
[Businessman (vice chairman of AlliantGroup, a tax firm),
the 46th IRS Commissioner (2003-2007), and the CEO of the Red Cross (brief stint in 2007).

more than each of Bush, Pataki, Graham, Gilmore, Everson.  
However, Fulbright's average score 0.065 was

<p>
The first write-in row of the table pertains to Fulbright;
all the non-Fulbright write-ins have been combined in the second write-in row.
</p><p>
<b>Why were these results so different from nationwide polls?</b>
Because the sample (i.e. the voters) at the RLC convention was highly unrepresentative of
Republicans nationwide: 
</p><ol type="A"><li>
The Paul and Cruz campaigns intentionally 
paid to import about 600 <b>"pollbot"</b> voters whose
main purpose was to vote for them and them alone, in order to create for the media
the fake impression they had "won" the straw poll.  It is, however, plausible
Paul would have won even without such manipulation
efforts, since he (and his father Ron Paul,
who'd won the same straw poll in 2012) were indeed highly popular within the
"liberty caucus."
</li><li>
The voters also included about 100 RLC members, 
</li><li>
about 50 local libertarians, 
</li><li>
and about 50 convention-speakers
(including the two leading candidates in this poll themselves: Paul &amp; Cruz).
</li></ol><p>
At a first approximation,
the pollbots all voted for their man with top rating, rating everybody else zero.
That simplistic behavior makes it pretty easy for you (if you want) to detect and mentally-remove
them from the results.
But actually, there were exactly 464 voters who rated (Paul=5,Cruz=0) or (Cruz=5,Paul=0)
and of them, exactly 366 rated everybody else 0 (of whom 240 were PaulBots and 126 
CruzBots).  These counts suggest some of the pollbots
may not have been quite that simplistic, or that our estimate of 600 pollbots was too large.
</p><blockquote>
<b>If we remove these 240 PaulBots and 126 CruzBots</b> from the electorate, then
Paul's mean score drops to 3.00,
<!--
(184+30-126)*0 + 32*1 + 32*2 + 56*3 + 51*4 + (394-240)*5
1238
184+30-126 + 32 + 32 + 56 + 51 + 394-240
413
1238/413 = 2.998
-->
Cruz's mean rises to 3.63,
<!--
(277+30-240)*0 + 12*1 + 17*2 + 37*3 + 58*4 + (348-126)*5
1499
277+30-240 + 12 + 17 + 37 + 58 + 348-126
413
1499/413 = 3.630
-->
and Carson's rises to 2.68.
<!--
(422+26-240-126)*0 + 26*1 + 33*2 + 83*3 + 135*4 + 35*5
1056
422+26-240-126 + 26 + 33 + 83 + 135 + 35
394
1056 / 394 = 2.680
-->
This suggests that Paul's "victory" in this poll might have been caused by his
strategic-voter conspiracy; perhaps Cruz really should have won.
</blockquote><p>
Meanwhile, the non-pollbots approved varying numbers of candidates, averaging about 4.
Of course all four subsets A,B,C,D were highly unrepresentative of the nation, although (C) 
presumably came the closest to being representative.
</p>
<b>What lessons do we learn from this poll?</b>
This is one of the first, perhaps even the first, polls in which the voters used all three
voting systems simultaneously.  That allows us to compare them in action.
</p><blockquote>
It is clear the plurality vote was massively distorted.
The approval and score votes, however, arrived at approximately the same conclusions,
suggesting they both performed pretty well.
Specifically the same ordering was output by both <i>except</i> for
adjacent-transposition of (Trump,Jindal) and a cyclic shift of the
last 3 finishers (Graham,Gilmore,Everson).
</blockquote><p>
This also is one of the first, perhaps even the first, polls in which
it was fully acknowledged by all that there was a <b>huge attempt
to manipulate the election</b> to make Paul and Cruz win (two opposed strategic-voter teams,
each organized and recruited).
The organizers of the conference even <i>encouraged</i> this in an attempt to get
more attendance-fee income &ndash; oh sorry, actually to
"provide a test of the organizing and recruiting skills of the
candidates."  (Perhaps a better wording would have been "bribing skills" but we digress.
Actually even as I write this in Oct. 2015, some of Rand Paul's top campaign workers 
are under indictment right now for a bribery
that was part of his father Ron Paul's previous campaign for US president.)

Furthermore, each ballot had a barcode on it coding the identity of the voter.
While we have kept all voters anonymous, we did employ this barcode inthe following useful manner:
if the voter's ID number was less than 200, that menat he was a 
"Liberty Caucus member"; while if &ge;200 he was a "conference visitor."
The pollbots were mainly conference vistors  while the honest voters were mainly 
caucus members?  The point of this that that we can roughly assess the impact of the 
strategic manipulation attempt by comparing versus
what would have happened if only the 98 voters with ID#&lt;200 had voted?
</p><p>
The answer is Rand Paul still would have won by all 3 voting methods, indeed 
even more convincingly.
</p>
-->
<a name="StratImpact"></a>
<p>
This allows us to <b>assess the impact of massive organized strategic voting efforts
on the three voting systems.</b>
First of all, it is obvious that plurality voting was reduced to smoking rubble
by the two strategic voter teams.
</p>
<h3><a href="MedianVrange.html">MJ</a>
massively fails in real world strategy-defense test
while plain average-based score defends quite well</h3>
<p>
Second, the so-called "majority judgment"  voting 
<a href="MedianVrange.html">scheme</a> was recommended by
<a href="BalinskiL.html">Balinski &amp; Laraki</a>, based 
<i>not</i> on the <i>average</i> rating,
but rather on the <i>median</i> rating (plus a certain tie-breaking scheme if necessary).
The top alleged reason for preferring median was that it would provide a better defense versus 
strategic voting, and/or discourage voters from even bothering to be strategic at all.

We here are in a position to perform the <b>first-ever real-world test of that claim</b>
in an election with (as all involved acknowledged) massive organized 
strategic voting conspiracies.
</p><p>
The answer is about as clear as it could possibly be (albeit only based on this one election):
MJ massively failed to provide such a defense.  
Plain average bent, but did not break, under the massive strategic assault.
But MJ totally collapsed, claiming Paul had a "<i>perfect</i>" 5.0 median score
&ndash; the same as presumably would have been obtained by "God" &ndash;
while all rivals had "worst possible" median score 0.0 (the same as would have been obtained 
by the "Devil"), except for Cruz with 4.0.
</p><p>
("Paul=5, all others&le;X"
also holds regardless of whether we regard blank as 0 score, or 
as any other value&le;X.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile with ordinary average-based range voting, 
Paul only got average score 3.17 even with all strategists 
included.  Without strategy, I believe Paul's average would have been
about <b>3.6&plusmn;0.6</b>.
Cruz got 
average score 2.77 with all strategists 
included.  Without strategy, I believe Cruz's average would have been
about <b>3.5&plusmn;0.6</b>.
Note average also outperforms median reckoned by the
<i>difference</i> 0.4 between Paul's and Cruz's averages versus the 
<i>difference</i> 1.0 between Paul's and Cruz's medians.
(This remains true even if we multiply the former by 5/3.17.)
</p><p>
So there is no question plain average outperforms MJ as a defender against strategic voting,
at least in this election.
</p><p>
The problem in this election is Paul &amp; Cruz imported such large numbers of "pollbot"
voters.    Median initially sounds like a good defense, because it and 
<a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed means</a>
sort of "go with the majority" and trim off the outliers.  But in this election, 
the <i>majority</i> of voters were saying Paul=5 (most of them strategists) 
and therefore as far as median was concerned
essentially <i>every</i> honest voter was an "outlier" who "should be trimmed 
off"!   So MJ's "defense" actually made it worse, not better. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile plain average was hurt little, 
because the strategists and counterstrategists 
largely <i>canceled each other out</i> in terms of their 
effect on Paul's and Cruz's averages
(but the counterstrategists unfortunately had 
<i>no</i> effect on Paul's median).
And actually I suspect this kind of near-cancellation
is a common state of affairs, not merely a lucky break only just for this election. 
Which is why I suspect in the real political election world, medians are 
not an improvement even though Balinski &amp; Laraki propagandize they are. 
And while the evidence from real world studies like this is small 
(since few of them) but to the extent it exists, it supports my view quite well. 
</p><p>
<small>
It's amazing how MJ keeps performing demonstrably worse than plain averages
when tried in the real world, and how 
the pro-MJ propagandists then often cover their eyes. 
But this particular poll appears to be the worst MJ-suck yet... 
since it's hard to be worse than worst-possible.

</p><p>
We also can consider the effect of 
<a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed means</a>
with different trim-off fractions for this election.
