<H2> Answer to Puzzle #40 &ndash;
Feel alike &rArr; vote same?
</H2>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b>
A single-winner voting system satisfies FAVS if the best strategy for any set of "feel alike"
voters is for all members of the set to vote in the same manner.
<br><b>(a)</b>
Show that instant runoff voting (IRV) fails FAVS.
<br><b>(b)</b>
Show that Borda voting fails FAVS.
<br><b>(c)</b>
Show that the Schulze beatpaths Condorcet method (with Simpson-Kramer min max as
a tiebreaker, i.e. of two tied Schulze winners, the one with a milder worst-defeat
is preferred) fails FAVS.
<br><b>(d)</b>
Show that Approval voting satisfies FAVS &ndash; but not if we allow 
incomplete-information scenarios
(i.e. in which the strategic-voter-set does not have complete information about all
the other votes).
<br><b>(e)</b>
Show that range voting always satisfies FAVS in both complete and incomplete information
scenarios.
<br>
(It is not clear whether satisfying FAVS is desirable, but this result is of interest
for refuting the vague claim that strategy in range
voting is comparatively 
"complicated" or "messy.")
</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
<br>

<p>
<b>(a)</b>
In this <b>IRV</b> election, if 4 additional voters (all of whom want to elect A) vote:
If all 4 vote A top: C wins.
If all 4 vote C top: C wins.
If all 4 vote B top: B wins.
Best group strategy is 2 vote A and 2 vote B &ndash; then A wins.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow" rules="rows">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 6 </td>
<td> B>C>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> C>B>A </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>(b)</b>
If the current <b>Borda</b> totals are as shown, then 7 more voters
can elect "Good" by voting (2,1,0) thrice and (2,0,1) four times, but
any 7 copies of the <i>same</i>
vote will fail to elect Good.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow" rules="rows">
<tr>
<th> Candidate </th>
<th> their current total </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Good </td>
<td> 0 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Lousy </td>
<td> 9 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Cruddy </td>
<td> 9 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>(c)</b>
Here is an example to show
that Schulze beatpaths (or Tideman ranked pairs) Condorcet voting,
with "Simpson Kramer minmax" used as tiebreaker in both cases,
fails FAVS.
</p><p>
There are 7 candidates, labeled 0,1,...,6.
There are 3 strategic voters who wish to elect 0.
Suppose <i>after</i> these 3 voters cast 3 votes of the form
0>1=2=4>3=5=6
the situation is as follows:
every candidate X beats X+1, X+2, and X+4 (mod 7)
by a 5-vote margin.
</p><p>
In this situation, everything is completely symmetrical and every
candidate would
have an equal chance to win. Perfect tie. That is good (since without
these 3 votes, candidate-0 would have lost for sure) but not
good enough since only 1/7 chance that 0 will win.
</p><p>
The 3 voters can do better by reasoning as follows:
"1,2, and 4 form a Condorcet cycle.
So do 3,5, and 6. By changing our "=" to appropriately devised
">" and "<" we can strengthen or weaken
these two Condorect cycles (if we so choose)."
</p><p>
Suppose they strengthen them both. 
(This cannot be done by all voting the same,
but can be done by a mixture of 3 kinds of votes, e.g. 1>2>4, 2>4>1, 4>1>2.)
In that case, no member of
either of these cycles can win, because each has a worse defeat than
usual and hence by the worst-defeat-severity tiebreaking, must lose.
Hence, 0 must be the winner.
</p>

<p>
<b>(d)</b>
With approval voting, the feel-alike voters can (collusively) figure out the best candidate
they are capable of electing, then approve him 
(and those candidates they regard as superior) only.  
</p><p>
But in an <i>incomplete information</i> scenario, the 
<a href="RVstrat1.html#examples">first example here</a> scaled up by a factor of 10
can be used to see that 10 identical approval-style votes will be less good
than a mixture of 5 and 5 approval-type votes of two different types.
</p>

<p>
<b>(e)</b>
Range voting satisfies FAVS because suppose it didn't, then just have all the N voters
use the average of whatever N vote-vectors they used in their supposedly 
better-than-all-voting-same voting strategy
&ndash; to prove it actually <I>wasn't</i> "better."
