<H2> Why does IRV lead to 2-party domination? </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Because it just does:
The three IRV countries: 
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a> (mandated in their 1937 constitution),
<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>
and <a href="MaltaPol.html">Malta</a> (and more recently <a href="FijiPol.html">Fiji</a>
for a brief period of IRV democracy before its coup)
all are 2-party dominated (in IRV seats)
&ndash; <i>despite</i> having many other features in their governments
which would seem much more multiparty-genic than the USA with IRV added will ever have.
So you can be sure the USA with IRV would be 2-party dominated too.
<br><br>
<a href="AustralianPol.html">E.g.</a>
"The composition of IRV seatholders in Australia is very biased against 
third parties: examining all 564 statehouse & federal IRV seats we found only a 
single one occupied by a third party."
</li>
<li>
Australian analysts themselves agree that IRV leads to 2-party domination &ndash;
this is not just crazy old me talking.  A <i>quote</i> from
<a href=
"http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml">
http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml</a>
is IRV "promotes a two-party system to the detriment of minor parties and independents."
</li>
<li>
Because here is an <a href="TarrIrv.html">example election</a>
and here is <a href="IncentToExagg.html">another</a> in
which, if some voters honestly order the candidates N>G>B where N=Nader is the "third
party" candidate, then N and G both lose, <i>but</i> if those voters
dishonestly vote G>N>B or G>B>N, then G wins (a better result in their view).
In these example elections, just like under the present plurality system, voting Nader
is therefore <i>strategically foolish</i> even if he is your honest favorite.  
<br><br>
A possible reason why the Australian
House remains 2-party dominated after 80+ years of IRV is that
these kinds of elections happen
often enough so that strategic voters feel logically justified in thus "betraying"
Nader.  Hence: the third parties suffer
a tremendous disadvantage, hence they die off.
And hence voters <i>observing</i> this year after year
<i>realize</i> the third parties have no chance, which justifies
their strategic vote-exaggeration/betrayal decision all the more. 
(Who cares if you betray N if he had no chance anyhow?  
It is worth it if it increases the chance
G will win &ndash; or so they reason.)
Result: Vicious cycle &ndash; entrenched 2-party domination &ndash; third parties die.
<br>
<small>We do not know that this is the <i>actual</i> reason, but we will say that
it would be entirely logical if it were; the only way it is not the actual reason is
because of the insufficient-logic of Australian voters.  If we <i>instead</i> assume
more-mentally-challenged voters who don't know or can't understand this, then they
will likely just give the two-most-likely-to-win candidates top &amp; bottom rankings
&ndash; without worrying about whether
that <i>really</i> is logical or not &ndash; to "max out their vote's impact."
That is intuitive and requires no thought at all
(but nevertheless is supported by at least some deeper analysis)
and with IRV will prevent a third-party 
candidate from ever winning.
