=============================================================================
wds: I include the referee report below, plus comments by me prefaced "wds:".
=============================================================================
REFEREE REPORT:
The main result of this paper is an extension of an old result,
stating that the iteration of an analytic function has universal Turing
computational power. The extension allows the function to be entire
as well as perturbed by noise.

Besides this result, an important part of the paper is devoted to
critique the BSS notion of decidability over the reals for which
the author suggests an alternate definition.

The following are some additional remarks.
\begin{itemize}

\item
The fact that any open subset of $\R^n$ is BSS semidecidable is well known
(see for instance F. Cucker, J.L. Monta\~na and L.M. Pardo,
{\em Int. J. of Algebra and Computation}, 2, pp. 395--408, 1992).
Thus, there is no novelty in showing that one can decide whether a point
belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the point belongs to its interior.

--wds: actually, the following subset of R^2: 
  {x,y | my analytic fn iteration "halts" starting from here}
  (where you can use various definitions of the "halt" state,
  it does not matter terribly much which)
and its complement, are both well behaved sets with nice smooth boundaries. 
(Anyway even if not, we can restrict to such nice sets artificially.)
If we restrict to their interiors, we get 2 disjoint open
sets. Evidently, one of these 2 open subsets of R^2 is NOT BSS
semidecidable. This counterexample contradicts the "well known" claim 
by the referee.
It is unfortunate that the referee was deluded on this point.--wds

\item
The fact that $\{(x,y)\in\R^2\mid y\leq e^x\}$ is not BSS decidable is
folklore. If one wants the exponential (and a few more elementary functions)
to be decidable, it is enough to add them to the BSS model either directly
or by using oracles (as in E. Novak, {\em J. of Complexity} 11, pp. 57--73,
1995). In practice, the exponential function is approximated by
polynomials. Thus, to add it to the basic BSS model would be in
agreement with both the BSS computability
and a long tradition in approximation theory.

--wds: It is hard to argue with an unsupported claim something is
"folklore"...  so I will not... if it is folklore, all I can say is,
it is a bit strange that BCSS, in their book allegedly summarizing the
whole field, did not manage to mention this, since it represents a
nicer example of "BSS-undecidability" than the examples they did
give. And ditto for all the papers in the area I've managed to find...
(and its proof is quite nontrivial, depending on some heavy results
from number theory..., although once those results are known, the
proof becomes pretty easy.) Don't you think it would be a
little bit better if some publication actually MENTIONED this piece of
"folklore"? As opposed to the approach of preventing anyone from ever 
mentioning it in print, on the grounds that it is folklore??
  The referee in any case apparently misses the main point, which is,
that whether this is folklore or not, it makes it evident the BCSS
decidability definition is a silly one which ought to be replaced by a
better one. Namely, if a set this easy to decide is "undecidable" then
the definition of "undecidable" was silly - we ought to have a better
definition of "undecidable" in which easy sets are decidable and hard
sets are not!
  Finally, the Novak paper is a did-nothing paper with no results in it,
and the latest idea of the referee would seem to yield the conclusion
that ALL analytic functions should be added to the BSS model, which
would result in one heck of a different model, and is hardly a small step!
Indeed, merely adding exp to the model alone would change its complexity
properties VASTLY. Thus this offhand remark is extremely deceptive.--wds

\item
The author claims that the book by BCSS does not provide a proof
of the undecidability of the Mandelbrot set. Such a proof, although
sketchy, is in page 68 of [BCSS]. And it uses the fact that the
boundary of the Mandelbrot set has Haussdorf dimension 2 in such a way
that any other subset of $\R^2$ whose boundary has Haussdorf dimension
2 would be also BSS undecidable. Thus, the sentence in the abstract
``Neither [\dots] nor the fact that its boundary has Haussdorf
dimension 2, need have anything to do with the undecidability''
is meaningless.

--wds: I'll now quote the "proof, although sketchy" on page 68 of BCSS
in full: "A direct proof of lemma 3 is folklore following discussions
with M.Herman, A.Douady, J.Hubbard, and D.Sullivan."  I am afraid I do
not understand why the referee thinks this is a proof. Even a sketchy
one.  (And "Lemma 3" is the key fact that "any other subset of $\R^2$ whose
boundary has Haussdorf dimension 2 would be also BSS undecidable" the
referee needs.)  BCSS also confuse M with the boundary of M, which makes
things less valid still. BCSS page 68 also cite L.Blum and S.Smale:
The G\"odel incompleteness theorem and decidability over a ring,
321-339 in From Topology to Computation Proceedings of Smalefest
(ed.M.W.Hirsch, J.E.Marsden, M.Shub) Springer 1990 as the source of
their theorem 1 (that Mandelbrot is undecidable). But the proof given
in this cited paper (p.337-338) is not a proof either. I quote the last
2 sentences of that "proof": 
"Therefore, $\partial M intersect S_i$ is contained in $\partial M
intersect S_i$ and has [Haussdorf] dimension $\le 1$.  So now we have 
$\partial M = \Union_{i=1}^\infty (\partial M intersect S_i)$ has
[Haussdorf] dimension $\le 1$."

Observe in these two sentences that first, it seems a little bit
vacuous to say X is contained in X. Presumably the authors wanted
to say something non-vacuous instead, perhaps
"$\partial M intersect S_i$ is contained in $\partial (M intersect S_i)$"
or perhaps
"$\partial M intersect S_i$ is contained in $\partial S_i$."
Second, their following sentence depends implicitly on the assumption
(although they did not bother to say so) that if the boundary
$\partial M$ of a subset $M$ of $R^2$ is the union of a countable
number of sets, each of which is the Haussdorf dimension 1 boundary of
a semialgebraic set, then the Haussdorf dimension of $\partial M$ must 
be $\le 1$. 
That assumption in turn (although they again did not bother to say so)
would seem to depend upon the assumption that, if you have
a countable set of positive-valued functions f_1(r), f_2(r), f_3(r)...,
each of which has the property that  |log f_i(r) / log r|-->1 as r-->0+,
then  |( log sum_i f_i(r) ) / log r|-->1 as r-->0+.
However, counterexamples to this assumption may be constructed!
[Hint: first consider constructing a counterexample to
the simpler related conjecture that if you have
a countable set of positive-valued functions f_1(r), f_2(r), f_3(r)...,
each of which has the property that  f_i(r)-->const_i>0 as r-->0+,
then  sum_i f_i(r) --> const as  r-->0+. A counterexample involves
f_i(r) being a gaussian(r) where the Gaussian's get sharper and sharper
and higher and higher as i-->infinity.]
Thus, not only is there not a proof in BCSS, in fact there has been
no valid proof in the literature, ever, before my proof, that
M is BSS-undecidable.
(I would be happy to see the Blum-Smale proof rescuscitated somehow, which
plausibly is possible. All I am saying now, is it obviously is not a proof 
as it stands.)

It is unfortunate that the referee was deluded on this point, and prefers
non-proofs to actual proofs to the extent of preventing publication
of the latter.

Next, the referee's claim is misleading and verging on false:
  First, open subsets of R^2 whose boundaries have Haussdorf dimension
2 DO exist which ARE BSS-decidable... except for points exactly on
that boundary. A sketch of one construction is as follows (quite
sketchy, although far less so than BCSS p.68): consider a
"fractal"-like set defined by an augmentational edge replacement rule
like the Koch snowflake, except each edge is replaced by a sawtooth
whose teeth keep getting narrower and narrower in aspect ratio
approaching infinite aspect ratio on the nth stage as n-->infinity, so
that the fractal dimension approaches 2. The Koch snowflake's
complement is also constructible by a pure-augmentational replacement
rule and one can work similarly in our case. Then by simultaneously
constructing the snowflake and its complement algorithmically to
greater and greater accuracy, we ultimately must terminate with a
proof x,y is either inside or outside our set (unless x,y is exactly
on the boundary). If x,y is exactly on the boundary, then in the case
where we demand x,y be algebraic, or in the case where we demand
immunity to infinitesimal "noise" we can make the decision
algorithmically again. So, as usual, the only difficulty arises when
x,y is exactly on the boundary and non-algebraic, thus as usual
highlighting the specific wrongheaded nature of the BSS undecidability 
definition.
  Second, open subsets of R^2 whose boundaries have Haussdorf
dimension ANYTHING (besides 1) are BCSS undecidable, to the extent
this is true for Haussdorf dimension 2... i.e. a generic curve with
Haussdorf dimension H, for any 1<H<=2, will presumably bound a set
which is not a Countable Union of Algebraic Sets (and the curve itself
will not be CUAS) and hence must be BSS-undecidable. This was the
point the Blum-Smale "proof" I cited above, was striving to
make (let us accept that proof for the present purpose). 
Thus, again, dimension "H=2" has nothing to do with it, as I'd said.
  Finally, my sentence in the abstract was not "meaningless".  The
sentence in question, now restored with context (namely the sentence
after) was "Neither the inscrutable nature of $M$, nor the fact that
its boundary has Haussdorf dimension $2$, need have anything to do
with the undecidability. To see that, we show the well behaved set
$S_e = \{x,y | y \le e^x \}$ is BCSS-undecidable." Note that it
obviously has meaning, and the meaning is evident from the immediately
following sentence! However, I agree with the referee that if BCSS's
"lemma 3" is accepted (and I am not willing to accept it until a
genuine proof appears somewhere, as opposed to a vague reference to
"folklore", some name-dropping, and a published non-proof) then half
of the meaning is removed, it is sort of only a 1-way meaning.  I'd be
happily willing to rephrase this, therefore, in the event anyone ever
convinced me of that key lemma.--wds

\item
The author claims that, since the Mandelbrot set can be decided if we
require the inputs not to be on the boundary of the set (or to have
algebraic coordinates) then, such a set should be considered decidable.

This is far from clear. As one may expect, difficulties increase when
the input approaches the boundary of the set to be decided (this is
well known even in the decidable world; the notion of conditioning,
central in numerical analysis, deals with exactly this issue).

Also, if we restrict the inputs to be algebraic numbers the set of
inputs we are keeping has measure zero on the whole set of inputs. In
addition, one feels that such a set is not decidable in the same way
that, say, the set of positive definite matrices is. For the latter
set, algorithms exist which do not rely on any assumption of the
entries of the input matrix.

--wds: That is, the ref in his last paragraph
is pointing out that one may decide if an NxN
matrix is positive definite by carrying out a finite number (depending
on N only) of infinite-precision arithmetic operations. Meanwhile, the
algorithms wds proposed for Mandelbrot set and the y<e^x set need a number of
arithmetics depending on the real numbers themselves (there is nothing
analogous to "N" here).  Yes: This is all true; but: so what? If the
referee wants to be interested in this other notion, then he should define
that notion as yet another definition of "decidable" and study it, by
all means (although such a definition, would only allow unions of a
bounded number of bounded-degree algebraic sets, hence would hardly be
very interesting as a "decidability" notion!), but it is not my and it
is not the BCSS definition, nor is it interesting, so it is simply not
relevant to the present discussion.--wds

Referee continues:
Decidability is a worst-case notion. To claim that the Mandelbrot set
should not be considered undecidable because the problem becomes
decidable when restricted to some subset of inputs is as wrong as to
claim that an NP-complete should not be considered so because there is
an algorithm deciding the set in polynomial time when restricted to a
large subset of inputs.

--wds: there is a big difference! - my subset is DENSE and it is
FINITELY SPECIFIABLE. In fact, it is precisely the subset of R^2
recognizable in a finite number of steps of a BCSS machine (much like
the spirit of the referee's example of positive definite matrices!).
So the correct analogy would therefore have been "...because there is
an algorithm deciding the set in polynomial time when restricted to
the subset of the inputs which can be recognized as a `valid format' input in
a finite amount of time."
(A different correct analogy would have considered it important
that the machine still work in the presence of infinitesimal noise -
leading to my alternative definition of BCSS undecidable.)
Because these revised corrected analogies would make the referee look silly.
I think the referee is very philosophically off base here.  Even if
he denies that, he needs to admit my philosophy is worth airing!--wds

\item
Last but not least. All the BSS undecidable sets which the
author thinks should be considered decidable are actually very
``tame'' undecidable sets.  They (or their complements) are
recursively enumerable. Cucker (The arithmetical hierarchy over the
reals {\em Journal of Logic and Computation}, 2, pp. 375-395, 1992)
has studied properties of an arithmetical hierarchy over $\R$ and
given complete problems for some of its lower levels. It would be
interesting to classify the set given by the author in Theorem~9
within this hierarhy.
\end{itemize}

--wds: so what? I happen to like tame undecidable sets.  In fact I was
trying to make as tame ones as I could. If the referee thinks this
usual aim is somehow a poor goal, I must disagree. It is a good
goal. The fact I have succeeded in this goal can only be taken as a
compliment to me. (I have not checked the Cucker cite here since the
journal it is in is not available in any libraries in my part
of the country.) Furthermore, it is now obvious since I have shown how
to make a Turing machine with an analytic function, how to construct
sets with any level of undecidability you want.--wds

----
ref's 1-paragraph summary of wds's paper:
Considers computation with real numbers, more specifically functions
whose iterations simulate universal Turing machines.  They prove that
rational functions are not, but there is an analytic function with a
pole at infinity that is.  The latter result was proved by others last
year, but the function has different properties.  They consider a new
definition of undecidability for sets in this model and argue that
their definition is more natural than the original definition.

--wds corrections to ref's summary: The ref's word "pole" should have
"essential singularity". It is NOT a pole.  (Also my main construction
is a meromorphic, not an analytic, function.)  The vague words "different
properties" miss the point that my construction works in the presence
of finite-amplitude noise, whereas the others all fail even in the
presence of unboundedly small noise. This seems to me to mean, my
construction is far more important than all previous ones, because it
and only it, has any chance of being applicable in any real life
scenario.  The previous ones are of little or no interest from that
point of view. The ref's "last year" is misleading since that was
actually done about 30 years ago.  The ref's "more natural" is a big
understatement in my view, more accurate would be "the previous
definition was a disaster, but now we can finally proceed since wds
has at last suggested the `right' definition."--wds

======================END OF REFEREE REPORT================

--wds summary: this ref has tried harder than most FOCS referees in my
experience, and I appreciate that,  BUT he has nevertheless gotten
essentially everything he said about my paper that would seem
negative, either wrong (since refuted by counterexample), or highly
misleading... thus he has actually performed worse than a random coin
toss, which is unsurprising since he was a biased coin, rather
obviously motivated by his own personal agenda... (in fact it is
rather obvious exactly who the referee is -- hint: it is an author of
BCSS -- and therefore rather obvious the referee entered the picture 
with a pre-made bias...) An important MORAL is... do not choose referees 
who have pre-biases; it's somewhere between unethical, irresponsible,
and unwise.
--wds.
