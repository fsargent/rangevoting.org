<h2> Range voting's superiority versus every tie-avoiding
monotone majority-top-respecting rank-order(equalities permitted) 
voting method
</h2>

<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, June 2009 </small></p>

<p>
In a previous
3-part paper, I had proved various results of the form that "range voting" was a superior
single-winner voting method (measured by "Bayesian Regret") to every rank-order voting method.
E.g. this was shown for N=3 candidates, for any mixture of "honest" and "strategic" voters,
under the RNEM ("random normal elections model") with V&rarr;&infin; voters, 
and also for honest voters for
N=4,5,...,31 candidates.
</p>

<p>
However, one criticism of those results was that they pertained only to voting systems based on
<i>strict</i> rank-order ballots.
What if equalities are permitted in the rank orderings?  For example, an allowed
vote in a 5-candidate election might then be "A&gt;B=C&gt;D=E."
In internet voting-method discussion groups over the last 15 years, a consensus has arisen
that permitting equalities is very important to allow good performance in the presence of
strategic voters.
</p>
<p>
We shall now give some extremely <i>simple</i> arguments indicating
range voting's superiority 
(with V&rarr;&infin; voters, either all-honest or all-strategic) 
over every such voting method
which satisfies
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>P1.</b> &nbsp; Monotonicity: worsening the rank of X in a ballot
(leaving the rest of the ballot unaltered) cannot
increase X's winning chances; and improving the rank of X cannot decrease them.
<br>
<b>P2.</b> &nbsp; Respects Majority-Top:
if X is ranked unique-top by a majority of the voters, then X must win.
<br>
<b>P3.</b>  &nbsp; No "dictator" (voter who singlehandedly can always
control the winner) exists.
<br>
<b>P4.</b>  &nbsp; Ties and near-ties (in which a single vote can alter the winner)
have likelihood approaching 0 when the number of voters is made very large;
and (&ge;3)-way ties and near-ties have likelihood approaching 0 faster (i.e. approach 0
<i>relative</i> to the 2-way tie+near-tie likelihoods).
<!-- </li><li>
Deterministic. -->
</blockquote>
<p>
Of these properties, almost every voting method seriously proposed by mankind satisfies
P3 &ndash; indeed satisfies the stronger demands of
"anonymity" and "neutrality" (permuting the voters has no effect on the winner; 
permuting the candidates has no effect aside from same-permuting the winner).
Also P3 is, strictly speaking, not really needed at all because it is implied by P2.
We confess that really P4 is about the
voting method <i>and</I> some underlying probabilistic model
describing how the voters generate their votes.
P4 is also usually satisfied automatically,
so only properties P1 &amp; P2 have much interest.
Examples of voting methods satisfying all these properties (all these voting methods
that we do not define here, are defined in Tideman's book):
<ul><li>
Plurality, 
</li><li>
Black (Condorcet with Borda as fallback, 
where note Borda has to be defined
in such a way it remains monotonic when rank-equalities are permitted),
</li><li>
Schulze-beatpaths Condorcet,
</li><li>
Tideman ranked-pairs Condorcet,
</li><li>
Simpson-Kramer minmax Condorcet.
</li></ul>
Examples of voting methods <i>failing</I> to satisfy the full set of properties:
<ul><li>
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Coombs-elimination, Nanson-Condorcet, 
and Woodall 1997's WBS-IRV-Condorcet method &ndash; all these are not monotone.
(The rules of IRV are 
that the candidate with the fewest votes is repeatedly eliminated [both from the election 
and from all ballots], where a ballot co-equally ranking K different candidates top 
is regarded as giving them each 1/K "votes"; the rules of WBS-IRV are the same except 
that as soon as a "beats-all" winner appears among the still-remaining candidates, the 
process ceases and he wins.)
However, our main theorem below would still apply even to these systems if their voters
<i>acted like</i> they <i>thought</i> these methods were monotone.
</li><li>
Borda count (does not respect majority-top)
</li><li>
Copeland's Condorcet system (with the number N of candidates fixed and the number V of
voters taken to &infin;, the tie-probability approaches a nonzero <i>constant</i>;
for proof of this, see 
<a href="../../PuzzlePage.html#p100">puzzle #100</a>
on the
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/RangeVoting.org">RangeVoting.org</a> puzzle page
<a href="../../PuzzlePage.html">http://rangevoting.org/PuzzlePage.html</a>).
However, Copeland <i>would</i> satisfy the conditions if it were modified to
adjoin a suitable tie-breaking method which did not destroy monotonicity.
</li></ul>
<p>
We shall soon state the argument.  
Throughout we assume the number of voters is V&rarr;&infin; and
the number of candidates is some fixed integer N&ge;3.
Our model of strategy will be
(as is common in the literature)
"hindsight-based." Specifically, we do the election with honest votes
(each voter voting in isolation), then each voter is now granted
full information about the results and is permitted (in isolation acting under the
assumption the other votes will change in a randomized manner but
are unlikely to change much) to alter her vote;
and finally we consider the result of the modified election.
</p>
<h2>Honest voters</h2>
<p>
In a probabilistic model such as the RNEM, the probability that any  
voter regards any two candidates as having exactly-equal utility values, is zero.
Therefore, honest voters will  <i>never use</I> equal rankings.
Therefore, our extension to permit equalities in rankings, has no effect, 
and the previous papers'
results about range voting's superiority versus rank-order voting methods, remain in effect.
</P>
<h2>Strategic voters</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> With high probability, your vote (in an election with a large number V of voters) is
going to have no effect &ndash; you cannot change the winner since you cannot
create or break a tie because
the election is too far away from being a tie. 
In this case, how you
vote is irrelevant.
</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
 In the unlikely event your vote <i>can</I> have an effect, it is most
likely to be because you have a chance to create or break a tie
between <i>two</i> candidates &ndash; call them A &amp; B &ndash; 
the two "frontrunners."
More precisely, you have an opportunity to make either win.
(Without loss of generality we shall assume you prefer A over B.)
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Much less likely still is the situation where your vote actually
has the power to make one of <i>three</i> or more candidates win (you choose
which).  
Due to P4 we shall 
<i>neglect</I> that as just too incredibly unlikely in the 
V&rarr;&infin; limit.
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
If in range voting the two frontrunners are A &amp; B, your
strategically best vote is
scoring A max, B min.  
Now your scores for the others are irrelevant if only A &amp; B can win, but
to help yourself maximally in the ultra-unlikely 3-way-tie case in (3), you'd want to
(semi-honestly) score everybody you prefer over A, also max,
everybody you hate worse than B, also min, and everybody you think lies
between A &amp; B, ordered in some non-dishonest manner (which we shall not specify any more
precisely).  This strategic
vote then is "semi-honest," that is, never
orders X&gt;Y for any X,Y for which you honestly feel Y&gt;X.
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
In a monotone rank-order voting method
you cannot go wrong, i.e. cannot make your vote strategically suboptimal,
by ranking A unique-top and B unique-bottom &ndash; both of
which, in general, will be dishonest, but this is always strategically
correct.   [Proof of that by contradiction: if you like some other
vote, then I will alter your vote by raising A to unique-top and dropping B to unique-bottom, 
and by monotonicity (P1) and the assumption (3) that only A or B can win,
these alterations can only make the vote more strategic. Q.E.D.]
How one should vote about the candidates <i>other</I> than A and B is, 
however, much more mysterious.   For example, it could be that some magic 
ordering of the others does the job and gives A the win.  
</p><p> 
Remark: Voting "honestly" (or even merely "semi-honestly" where you sometimes dishonestly rank
candidates equal but never opposite-order them)
is known to be incorrect strategy
for any deterministic rank-order 
voting method in our class.
(In general. Of course in <i>some</i> elections for some voters, honesty is best strategy.)
This is the "Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem."
This remark will not be needed for our argument, but nevertheless is illuminating and hence 
we shall illustrate it with several concrete examples (whose details will only be sketched;
the king-chicken theorem is described and proven by Maurer 1980 and extended by me as described
in that citation):
</p>
<small>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Consider the Simpson-Kramer minmax Condorcet voting method
where only two of the candidates (A &amp; B)
have a chance of victory because they are the only two 
whose largest-defeats are small (and we shall assume
they are almost equally small so that your vote can decide
the issue).  Then if the two key pairwise defeats are C-beats-A and D-beats-B, you will want to 
rank D strictly above B and A strictly above C <i>even if you honestly feel the opposite in both 
cases</i>.  Clearly in many situations this and only this can assure A's victory.
</li><li>
In Tideman's ranked-pairs Condorcet voting method:
Here the crucial tie might be between a C-over-A defeat and a D-over-E defeat,
and now you may need to strictly-dishonestly-rank {D,E} in order to allow A to win.
</li><li>
To get <i>quantitative</I> about it,
consider the Schulze-beatpaths method in a probabilistic model where the (N-1)N/2 
pairwise victory margins are i.i.d. 0-centered normal deviates.  In that case,
by my strengthening (the proof is essentially the same as the original)
of Maurer's "king chicken theorem" we know that
for every ordered pair (X,Y) of candidates,
X <!-- perhaps directly defeats Y, and  -->
"defeats" Y via at least N/5 different 2-defeat chains (such as "X beats Q and Q beats Y"),
with probability&rarr;1 exponentially as N&rarr;&infin;.   
From this it follows that <i>if</i> some single ballot has the power to alter the election winner,
then with probability&rarr;1 as V&rarr;&infin; it can only lead to <i>two</i> winners 
(call them A &amp; B);
and with probability&ge;C, for some positive
constant C (depending on N) which approaches at least 3/4 when N&rarr;&infin;,
at least one of the two crucial pairwise defeats will fail to involve A or fail to involve B
(call the pair involved {D,E} where D&ne;E and <nobr>{D,E}&ne;{A,B}).</nobr>
This implies that strictly-dishonest ordering of {D,E} will be strategically forced
(for any given voter)
in Schulze voting in which that voter ranks A unique top and B unique bottom, 
with  probability&ge;K where K is a positive constant 
(approaching at least 3/8 when N&rarr;&infin;), in situations where any lone
voter has any power.   
</li><li>
By a further extension of Maurer's king chicken theorem now involving L-long "defeat paths"
instead of 2-long (where now L is of order logN), one can indeed demonstrate that,
<i>
with probability exponentially approaching 1 as N&rarr;&infin; in N-candidate "random elections,"
at least a constant fraction K
of Schulze voters in random elections 
will feel strategically forced to <u>strictly</u>-misorder at least
one pair of candidates in their vote, where K&rarr;3/4 when N&rarr;&infin;.
"Feel strategically forced" means that if they do not do this, their expected
utility will decrease.</i>
</li><li>
More generally, 
Friedgut, Kalai, and Nisan 2008 gave a <i>quantitative</i>
version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem.
It yields results of the above kind in very general settings, but their bounds are
rather weak compared to (c) and (d) above.
<!--
at least a positive absolute 
constant fraction of voters
will feel strategically forced to be dishonest, in any anonymous,
strict-rank-order voting method,
in random (N=3)-candidate elections respecting majority-top, with probability greater than
a positive absolute constant divided by V.  
 This sucks since it is weak. -->
</li>
<!-- <li>
If the voting system obeys property P4 in the sense that we can neglect 
(&ge;3)-way-near-ties,
then it follows from the random-elections assumption and anonymity that 
at least a positive absolute
constant fraction of voters
will feel strategically forced to be dishonest, in any anonymous,
strict-rank-order voting method,
in random (N=3)-candidate elections respecting majority-top, with 
(conditional) probability greater than
a positive absolute constant,
<i>restricted to those elections in which any voter has any power.</i>
??OH? Priblem is, semi-dishonesty could still work.
</li> -->
</ol>
</small>
<p>
We shall not specify how our voters rank the others besides A and B (aside from pointing
out that ranking A unique-top and B unique-bottom cannot sacrifice strategic optimality).
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
If all voters cast votes of the type in (5), then
(in the absence of a perfect tie, which P4 says has likelihood&rarr;0)
by P2 we know that A or B must win.
Furthermore, all our voting methods will yield the <i>same</I> winner, namely the same winner
as we get from strategic plurality voting.  Hence in this sense, no voting method of
this form improves over plurality voting (contrary to advertising!)
&ndash; all have the same Bayesian regret &ndash;
for voters of the strategic ilk in (5).  
</p><p>
<b>7.</b>
However, <i>approval voters</i> will approve one (but not both, if they
want to be strategic) of {A,B} and then as we discussed in (4), it then, when all
the voters act this way,
becomes entirely possible that (contrary to pre-election 
expectation) somebody other than A and B will win.
Strategic approval (and range) voting thus is <i>inequivalent</i>
to strategic plurality voting, and  indeed results in my previous papers indicate
approval's superiority
(measured by Bayesian Regret under the RNEM).
To be a bit more general about it, we conclude:
</p><p>
<b>THEOREM:</b>
<i>In every probabilistic setting in which all-strategic approval voting yields
a better Bayesian regret than all-strategic plurality voting of the form described in (5) above,
it also is better than <u>every</u> other rank-order(equalities permitted) voting method
satisfying properties P1-P4, assuming the 100%-strategic-voters in the
rank-order-method  all take advantage of
the theorem that ranking A and B unique-top and unique-bottom, is always optimally
strategic in a situation where your vote cannot hope to make the winner be anybody else.
</i>
</P>
<p>
In view of our previous papers' 
experience and also in view of range voting's superiority-results
with either 100%-honest or 100%-strategic voters, it now seems plausible that
claims also could be formulated arguing range is superior
for any honest+strategic voter <b>mixture</b>.  
But I have no proof of that.
Re that, the following <b>mini-theorem</b>
perhaps also is of some interest: in the event the rank-order(equalities permitted)
voters were to cast only "approval style" ballots (of form like A=B&gt;C=D=E involving at most
<i>one</i> "&gt;") then every Condorcet voting method, the Borda count,
and approval voting, all elect the same winner; but IRV's winner can differ.

<h2> About strategy in real life </h2>
<p>
The "naive exaggeration strategy" of (in rank-order ballot methods)
ranking one of the two frontrunners artificially top and the other artifically bottom,
in fact seems to be what about 80-95% of the voters in Australia do (at least if "bottom"
is weakened to "bottom or second-from-bottom in, say, a 7-choice field").  
This is true even though
the rank-order-ballot voting methods used in Australia (Instant Runoff Voting IRV 
for the single-winner
House elections, and Hare-Droop reweighted STV for multiwinner Senate elections) are not monotonic
&ndash;
and even though with IRV, lowering a candidate B in a ballot never helps his rival A
whom you ranked higher.  
We conclude from this that the naive exaggeration strategy is very attractive in real life &ndash;
perhaps to an even greater extent than is logically justified.
</p>
<p>
Critics have asked me whether I considered it plausible that many
voters would vote dishonestly even though the expected payoff for doing so, might
be extremely small.  My answer is "yes."
I also comment that
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Many millions of voters in the USA vote, even though the expected payoff
for doing so (considering the chances your vote will alter the election outcome, 
and the time and transport costs required for you to vote) is not merely "small" but in fact
<i>negative</i>.
</li><li>
Barry C. Burden has estimated from NES data that about 90% of the voters whose honest favorite
in the 2000 US presidential contest was
Ralph Nader, actually voted (strategically) for somebody else.
</li><li>
The Australian 80-95%-naive-strategy figure arises mainly from official party-recommended
strategic ballot rank-orderings ("how to vote" cards).   Note that since parties have
access to computers, experts, pollsters, etc, even complicated strategies do not 
necessarily pose an obstacle.   This rate (80-95%) while not 100% still is so great that 
our theorem <i>effectively</i> applies for IRV &ndash; meaning IRV
victories by candidates not in one of the two major parties
are almost impossible under normal circumstances.  
Indeed, in the 150 year-2007 Australian 
House elections,
zero candidates won who were running under the flag of a third party (same as in the preceding
election cycle).  Apparently there were at least 9 cases where the Green-party candidate was
a beats-all "Condorcet winner" but nevertheless lost. 
That indicates that even with 95% naive-strategy rate,
a noticeable number of third-party victors still might occur with Condorcet voting, 
even though not with IRV.  The difference is because in situations where the two frontrunner
have an almost even split of the top-rank votes (say 47% versus 48%) a third-party
candidate can be a beats-all winner &ndash; but could never win with IRV.
</li></ol>
<p>
Somewhat surprisingly, in all of the (&asymp;10)
studies of <i>range voting</i> in real life that I am aware of,
have found remarkably high rates (e.g. &ge;75%) of manifestly non-strategic voting,
e.g. votes <i>not</i> maxing and minning the scores of all the candidates.
A partial explanation for this is that after one maxes and mins the scores for the two 
frontrunners,
the payoff for doing the same to the remaining N-2
candidates (as opposed to being honest about them)
is usually far smaller in comparison.   
Another hypothesis would be that voters experience a 
certain amount of joy (i.e. utility payoff) merely from
the <i>act</i> of voting honestly and feeling they are doing something socially useful.
This psychological payoff is ultimately a consequence of Darwinian evolution on <i>tribes</i>.
And (we speculate further) it is greater in voting systems permitting greater expressivity, 
i.e. greater opportunity for a voter to be honest.   
Range voting has greater expressivity than all common
rival schemes.   If this speculation is correct, then range voting will enjoy an
<i>additional</i> advantage over 
those rival voting schemes, <i>beyond</i> that predictable by cold mathematics
about inhuman "voting entities" alone.
