Abstract

This brief note explains how to sample a probability $N$-vector in
$O(1)$ time per sample, with the aid of a $O(N)$-word data structure
buildable in $O(N)$ steps. The algorithm is highly practical;
we give pseudocode based on actual working code.

Keywords

Sampling. Linear time algorithm. Data structure.
