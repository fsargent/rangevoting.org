Some errata in the version that appeared in the STOC 1998 proceedings
are corrected in this online version. Of the known errata, the only
one that matters much is the "rounding assumption" at the beginning of
section 2.

The "L =" should say "L <=". Also, in the previous paragraph,
       L = sqrt(d) * N / (delta * M)
where  M >= 1  was the length of the old MST.
