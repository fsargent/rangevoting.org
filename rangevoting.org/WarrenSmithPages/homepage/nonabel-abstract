ABSTRACT:
A modified Bose-Chowla construction of sets with distinct sums of
$k$-element subsets is presented. In infinitely many cases it yields sets
with a certain multiplicative symmetry. These sets are then used to
construct large sets $S$ in certain nonabelian groups with the property
that all $k$-letter words with letters from $S$ are distinct.
