TITLE
Tail bound for sums of bounded random variables

AUTHOR

ABSTRACT
We bound the tail probability for a sum 
$X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_N$
of $N$ bounded random variables.
The variables are not assumed to be independent, but the mean and upper and lower
bounds on each $X_n$ are assumed independent of all the other $X_m$.
