  Applications of geometric separator theorems
Warren D. Smith and Nicholas C. Wormald

ABSTRACT
The companion paper ``Geometric separator theorems''
proved a large number
of separator theorems about geometrical objects.
We now find geometric separator theorems about geometrical 
{\em graphs}, and applications (mostly algorithmic) of them.

Examples:
{\tt I}: There exists a rectangle crossed by the minimal spanning
tree of $N$ sites
in the plane $\le (4 \cdot 3^{1/4} + o(1)) \sqrt{N}$ times, having
$\le 2N/3$ sites inside and outside.
{\tt II}: Similar results for
other geometrical graphs such as minimum matchings and traveling
salesman tours, and in arbitrary dimensions.
{\tt III}: $E$-edge 2-connected torus (or Klein bottle)
graphs, each of whose valencies and face sizes are $\ge 3$,
have a $1/3$-$2/3$ separator with $\le (4+o(1)) \sqrt{E}$
vertices in the separator. The separator corresponds to a simple
closed curve.
{\tt IV}: We exhibit $V$-vertex planar graphs such that any $1/3$-$2/3$
separator must have cardinality$\ge \sqrt{5V/2}$.
{\tt V}: We present the first subexponential algorithms for
optimal traveling salesman tour and rectilinear
Steiner tree of $N$ points in $d$-space, $d$ fixed.
The runtime if $d \ge 2$ is fixed is $N^{O(N^{1-1/d})}$.
The same runtime bound applies for finding a $1 + O(N^{-p})$ times
optimal length Steiner tree in the Euclidean norm if $p > 0$
is fixed.
{\tt VI}: Algorithm to determine all intersection relationships
among $N$ convex $d$-bodies with aspect ratios bounded by $B$.
If a point of space can be in at most $\kappa$ of the bodies
(i.e. they are ``$\kappa$-thick''),
then the runtime is $(\log N + \kappa B^d C) d^{O(d)} N$
and the memory requirement is $d^{O(d)} N$, where $C$ is
the amount of time required to test if two given objects
intersect.
{\tt VII}: Solve linear systems whose graph structure is
an intersection graph as in VI, in 
$O ( [ d \kappa^{1/d} B N^{1-1/d}]^\omega )$
time, $\omega < 2.376$.
{\tt VIII}: New data structure with $O(\log N)$ query time,
$O(N)$ space consumption, and $O(N \log N)$ build time,
to support point location among
$N$ convex boundedly thick convex bodies of
bounded aspect ratios in bounded dimension.
{\tt IX}: New algorithms for obstacle avoiding short paths among
boundedly thick obstacles of bounded aspect ratio in the plane.
E.g. this may be solved in preprocessing time
$O(N^{3/2} \log N )$
with storage 
$O(N \log N)$
and query time 
$O ( \log N )$ to report a path $3.01$ times longer
than optimal (in the $L_1$ obstacle avoiding metric)
between any two given points.
