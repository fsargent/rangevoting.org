TITLE
Ending credit card idiocy

AUTHOR
Warren D. Smith

ABSTRACT
It is embarrassing for anyone with the slightest exposure to
cryptographic algorithms to behold a monetary system as stupid 
as the present ``credit card system.''  I explain why and explain 
how to improve it drastically.
(Note: the ideas in this paper are mostly not new. Nevertheless it
seems worth saying them.)

KEYWORDS
cryptographic hash functions, smart cards, fraud.
