<H2> How the 2004 US Presidential election would have been under RV and AV, versus what it
was under plurality </H2>

<p> <small>Warren D. Smith. Updated to higher accuracy Sept. 2007.</small></p>
<p>
Here is the world's only actual data (as of 2005)
about range & approval voting vis-a-vis US third parties &ndash;
given in my paper
(#82  <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html"> here</a>)
coauthored with Doug Greene &amp; Jacqueline Quintal.
</p>

<p>
This is based on a pseudo-election
we conducted with real US voters (122 range voters
and 656 approval voters) 
simultaneously with the 2004 presidential election (as an exit poll).

As you can see, under 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> (RV) the <b>third party candidates</b>
<i>all</i> would have done a <b><i>lot</i> better</b> relative to Bush and Kerry than under
either
<a href="rangeVapp.html">approval voting</a> (AV) or
the current <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> (plur) system.
This illustrates the huge anti-third-party distortion that plurality voting usually causes.
</p>

<p>
[Warning: do not conclude from this that under RV or AV, Kerry would have
beaten Bush in 2004. That is mostly an artifact of the fact these polls
were of voters in New York State and Philadelphia PA suburbs, areas in which
Kerry <i>did</i> beat Bush &ndash; and did so comparably to our AV and RV poll results.
Bush won nationwide, as you can see from the "Plur" column.
It <i>is</i> legitimate to conclude RV will cause third parties to get a lot more support,
since in NY state and Philadelphia the third party plur voters were very rare.
The "Total3rd" row is just the sum of Nader, Badnarik, Cobb, Peroutka, and Calero results &ndash;
which is admittedly somewhat meaningless &ndash; but anyhow
as you can see it actually would have exceeded Bush's total under range voting.
Please see the full paper if you want, e.g, statistical error bars, which are omitted here
for simplicity.]
</p>

<p>
[Warning: the data on Socialist Worker's Party candidate Calero is included with
some trepidation because  there was not much data on him.
But as you can see what there was of it
also suggested that he would have gotten lots more range votes
than under
either AV or plurality.]

Also, you may be interested in the following.
In the 1992 US Presidential Election, according to an analysis of
National Election Study data by Steven J. Brams
and Samuel Merrill III
[<i>Politics and Political Science</i> 27,1 (March 1994) 39-44],
the vote totals again would have been <i>tremendously</i> altered with
approval voting (although the finish order would not have changed) again
illustrating the tremendous distortionary penalty faced by third-party
candidates under the plurality system.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption>1992 results:</caption>
<tr> 
<th> Candidate </th>
<th> Plur </th>
<th> AV </th>

<tr bgcolor="#ffaa00">
<td> Clinton(Dem) </td>
<td> 43.0 </td>
<td> 55 </td>

<tr bgcolor="#ccccff">

<p>
And in the 1980 US Presidential Election, according to the analysis 
based on many polls in chapter 9 of 
<a href="RVPapers.html">Brams &amp; Fishburn's book</a>,
Anderson probably actually would have come in <i>second</i> behind Reagan but ahead
of Carter, under approval voting, whereas under plurality voting he was far 
in third place with under 7% of the votes.
Again this illustrates the tremendous distortionary penalty faced by third-party
candidates under the plurality system.
