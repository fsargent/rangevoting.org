RangeVoting.org - "Consensus" by the "Experts"?
</title>

<H2> 
What is the "consensus" by the "experts"
about the best single-winner voting system?
</H2>

<p>
(<a href="ConsensusSumm.html">Executive summary</a>)
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate reality as of 2006 is that there is <i>no</i> visible consensus
among either political scientists, economists, or mathematicians
about the best single-winner voting system.
But there <i>should be</i>, and we think there ultimately will be,
a consensus for <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>.
</p>

<p>
The usual
impression one gathered from political science books up to 2000
was there were 4 main
branches of single-winner systems, namely,
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>, 
<a href="rangeVirv.html">single transferable vote</a>, 
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>, 
and
<a href="rangeVapp.html">approval</a>
voting &ndash;
with few people (and fewer, if any, books)
willing to stand up and say one of them was the best &ndash; and almost nobody in
that literature said <i>anything</i> about range voting whatever
up to about 2004 (well, see <a href="OlympHist.html">this history</a> for
some examples...)
</p>
<p>
Now that indecision was justifiable since <i>all four</i> of those systems
<i>do</i> seem best in computer simulation studies &ndash; depending on the "settings"
of the simulations.  (E.g. see <a href="RVPapers.html">Merrill's book</a>.)
In other words, computer simulation studies were incapable of reaching an 
unambiguous conclusion
that one of these four was the best; you can construct plausible election
situations where each seems better than the others.
Furthermore, philosophical comparisons
also were not capable of reaching such a conclusion, in the sense that people kept
disagreeing.
</p>
<p>
That changed with my computer-sim study in 2000 
(<a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">#56 here</a>)
which was the first to include range voting as a contender.
It used <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> as its yardstick,
and found RV was <i>always</i>
superior to <i>all four</I> of the above main voting system
branches at <i>every</i> setting
(of 720 tried) in my simulations.  So that in some sense gets rid of the indecision and
provides a clear best: Range Voting.  
My study also pointed out that "Arrow's impossibility theorem" which was often interpreted
to mean "no 'best' voting system can exist" actually <i>does not apply</i>
to range voting, since according to Arrow's (foolishly too-restrictive) definition RV is
<i>not</i> a "voting system."
But that information has not yet fully percolated into
published political science books and the general zeitgeist.

Now besides me just telling you my impression about my view of
the consensus thinking (above), there is this objective evidence.  
I examined the bylaws of
professional associations in the field and found:

its 1903 constitution mandates <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a> (transferable vote)
for presidential election
(but so far, apparently no election in which IRV was actually invoked has happened, so
it's been kind of irrelevant...  voting method choice is not an issue unless at least 3 
election outcomes are possible).  Also we should note that this constitution was written
<i>before</i> any political scientists first invented (in 1976)
Approval Voting.  Hence it
cannot be interpreted as a judgement by the Political Science community that IRV is superior
to Approval, although it might be interpreted as a judgement IRV is superior to Borda,
Condorcet, and Plurality.   APSA considered changing its nonpresidential elections (all conducted via plurality) to
use IRV and/or STV voting, and in a 2005 report (<a href="assets/documents/STVReportFinalforweb.pdf">pdf</a>)
decided against it.   Thus one could equally well interpret the APSA stance as saying 
(oppositely!) that plurality is superior to IRV.

Used 1-10 range voting to help select its "person of the year" in 2008.
(In 2007, Vladimir Putin had been selected by a non-democratic process.)
25 candidates, winner was Barack Obama, also just elected US president, with
average rating [rounded to integer] 10 based on 348416 ratings.  
Runner-up, also with 10 but based on only 15035 ratings, was Douglas Melton,
a biologist who partially-cured diabetes in mice in 
what might be a revolutionary development.
Every other candidate got average rating&le;7.

As far as I know as of 2008, no professional society whatever uses
Range,  Borda, or Condorcet voting &ndash;
but <a href="Debian2003.html">Debian</a> 
(Linux software developers; and previously the wikimedia foundation) use 
<a href="SchulzeComplic.html">Schulze's beatpath method</a> (which is a
complicated Condorcet method) conducted electronically via special software,
and many internet sites use Range Voting, e.g. 
<a href="http://allrecipes.com/">AllRecipes.com</a>,
<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/">Yahoo movies</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>,
<a href="http://hotornot.com">Hot or Not</a>,
<a href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com">internet movie database</a>,
<a href="http://vegvariety.cce.cornell.edu/">Cornell vegetable varieties agricultural rating service</a>,
etc; and <b>academia worldwide</b> long ago reached a "consensus" on 0-100
and A-F range voting for use in grading students and selecting valedictorians.
RV is also used by the Seattle commercial co-operative
<a href="http://www.madisonmarket.com/">Madison Market</a>
and various online polling services such as 
<a href="http://www.bigpulse.com/pm">bigpulse.com</a> and
<a href="http://zohopolls.com/">zohopolls.com</a>;
and Approval Voting is employed to elect Princeton University's USG president.

<b>At the Voting Procedures workshop</b> held in Normandy in July 2010, there was a vote
(using approval voting) for which, among 18 possible voting systems, its
participants (essentially all of whom were professional voting experts) 
preferred "for your town to use to elect the mayor."  
Result was: approval came top with 15 approvals.
(Only system approved by majority. The runner-up system, IRV, enjoyed 10 approvals.)
Plain plurality came (non-uniquely) bottom with zero.
</p>

<p>
<b>Verdict:</b>
based on the above, if there is any professional consensus
(which there isn't) it would be for <a href="rangeVapp.html">Approval Voting</a>, 
which is the maximally simple
degenerate case of <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a>
(which is also fairly highly supported academically).
</p>
<p>
Further, it would appear from the above that if there is a
professional
consensus <i>against</i> something, Condorcet and Borda are them,
with an especially bad knock against Borda.
However Mathematics Professor Donald G. Saari
is a noted Borda advocate and was infuriated by the SCWS's adoption of Approval
Voting. 
(I do not know of any other noted Borda advocates besides Saari.)
