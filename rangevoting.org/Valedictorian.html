<H2> Valedictorians </H2>

<p>
The word "valedictorian" in the USA and Canada, means the
top graduate of the graduating class of an educational institution.
</p>

<p>
Usually the choice is made based on
highest average grade (GPA), i.e. <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> by the professors
on all students (with grades=votes, and professors who did not have that student, 
hence never graded that student,
voting "blanks").
</p>

<p>
However, I was surprised to find from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian">wikipedia</a>
that other choice  procedures have also been used:
such as a (<a href="Plurality.html">plurality?!</a>) vote of the  senior students,
the "amount of dedication to certain extracurricular activities,"
the academic weight of classes taken, or direct appointment
by the school administration based on a more complex system of merit than grades alone.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the first known use of the "valedictorian" in the English language was by
Reverend Edward Holyoke,  
Harvard College president, who noted in a 1759 diary entry 
"Officers of the Sophisters [upperclassmen] chose Valedictorian."
So as you can see, although range voting is <i>now</i> by far the most popular
method of choosing college valedictorians, it did not <i>start</i> out that way.
This consensus arose only after experimentation with other systems.
</p>

<H2> Range voting experience </H2>

<p>
When you add up the number of schools out there choosing valedictorians in this way each year,
you realize that the total amount of human experience conducting range voting elections
(measured by number of elections) actually is comparable to or <i>exceeds</i>
the number of "conventional" plurality-voting elections choosing government officials.
</p>

<p>
So don't let anybody ever tell you that there isn't enough real world experience with 
range voting.
And indeed once you know that <a href="ApisMellifera.html">honeybees</a> use range voting
each year to choose a new nest site,
you realize that actually, <i>far</i> more range voting "elections" have been held by bees
than the
entire number of humans who ever lived.
