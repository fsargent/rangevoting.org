Official Burlington Mayoral 2006 IRV race results
from 
<a href="http://www.burlingtonvotes.org/20060307/">http://www.burlingtonvotes.org/20060307/</a>.
9788 ballots of which 77 were declared "invalid" before counting began.
Ploof, Louie the Cowman, Curley, and the WriteIns
were eliminated immediately &amp; simultaneously since
their "defeat was mathematically inevitable."
That left Miller vs Kiss in the final round, which was won by Kiss.
