<H2> Clarke-Groves-Tideman-Tullock "perfect" scheme for voting-with-money </H2>

<blockquote>
<i>This is what happens when some economists invent a voting system...</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
In principle, 
the ultimate voting scheme would be "honest utility voting" in which each voter
states the "utility" (measured in some common, agreed-upon units)
of each possible candidate for him, and then the candidate with the greatest
utility (summed over all of society) is elected.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, honest utility voting seems unachievable in practice, since
(a) there are no common agreed-upon units (and utility is intangible), and 
(b) just one dishonest-strategic voter,
by making some vast exaggeration, could control the election.
<small>
(However, in certain unusual scenarios, such as where the voters are not
dishonest humans, but rather honest <i>robots</i>, and in which utility <i>is</i>
easily measured, this voting method would be best possible.)
</small>
</p>
<p>
Therefore (the common thinking before the 1970s was) honest utility voting is
a pipe dream &ndash; an idealization of no practical interest.
However in the 1970s several people realized, some independently, that,
at least in a mathematical idealization of voters as rational economic money-maximizing
animals, such a "perfect" voting system (that always elects the max-utility candidate)
actually <i>is</i> achievable!
</p>
<p>
The initial idea (1961)
was by W.Vickrey  in a different context: auctioneering.
<small>(Vickrey was awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in economics, mainly for this idea.)</small>
Imagine some moderate number of bidders (e.g. 10-20) want to buy some expensive object.
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="assets/documents/rothkopf_article.pdf">Vickrey</a> second-price (sealed bid) auction protocol:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Each bidder privately estimates the true worth of the object, to him, in dollars.
</li><li> 
Each bidder submits that secret estimate, in a sealed envelope, as his bid.
</li><li>
All the envelopes are opened.  The winner is the one who submitted the
greatest bid, <i>but</i> now he only <i>pays</i> the amount
specified by the <i>second</i>-highest bidder.  
<!-- [<i>Modification suggested by Jan Kok:</i> 
if the top bid is <i>T</i> and the second-top bid <i>S</i>, then
we can make the payment be <i>S + (T-S)X</i>
for any constant or randomly chosen real
<i>X</i> with <i>0 &le; X &lt; 1</i>.]
Wait, this is not good because you are motivated to bid low because that will reduce
your payment!
-->
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Vickrey argued that in this scenario, <i>there is no strategic motivation for bidders to
be dishonest in their bids</i>, and plenty of motivation for them to be honest.
<small>
Bid too high? Risk paying more than it is worth.  Bid too low?  Risk not acquiring
the object at cost below its true worth to you, and does not reduce your payment
if you do get the object.</small>  
Note that in this scheme it
is important that the other bids be <i>secret</i>, since a bidder who knew the topmost
external bid could <i>then</i> have motivation to be dishonest and bid
1 cent below it to minimize the profit of that enemy bidder.
But it also is
important that the bids ultimately be <i>revealed</i> since otherwise the auctioneer could
cheat by pretending the second-top bid was much higher than it really was.
</p>
<p>
<b>Clarke-Groves-Tideman-Tullock public choice (i.e. voting) protocol:</b>
<ol>
</li><li>
Each voter as his (secret ballot) vote submits his private estimate of the true worth
of each candidate (or election alternative) to him, in dollars.
</li><li> 
The alternative (or candidate) with the greatest amount of money voted for it/him,
wins.
</li><li>
We now re-examine all the votes, but now with the name of its voter-author unveiled on each.
Suppose that vote "made a difference," i.e. caused the election result to differ from
what it would have been with that vote removed.  Namely, suppose without
some voter's pair (<i>B<sub>Y</sub>, B<sub>Z</sub></i>) of
vote-bids for candidates <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i>, alternative <i>Y</i> would have won,
but with it
alternative <i>Z</i> wins.
Suppose the minimum amount of money that vote-bid-difference
<i>B<sub>Z</sub>-B<sub>Y</sub></i>
could have been replaced by that still
would have caused <i>Z</i> to win, is <i>M<sub>YZ</sub></i> where
<i>0 &lt; M<sub>YZ</sub> &lt; B<sub>Z</sub>-B<sub>Y</sub></i>.  
Then that voter now must pay a <i>fee</i>
(the "Clarke tax") equal to <i>M<sub>YZ</sub></i>.  
<!-- [Modified version: the payment is 
<i>M<sub>YZ</sub> + (B<sub>Z</sub>-B<sub>Y</sub>-M<sub>YZ</sub>) X</i>
for any constant or randomly chosen real
<i>X</i> with <i>0 &le; X &lt; 1</i>.] Again, this modification encourages underbidding. -->
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
The Clarke-Groves-Tideman-Tullock <b>central claim</b>
is that there is no strategic motivation for voters to
be dishonest in their votes, and plenty of motivation for them to be honest.<small>
Bid too high? Risk paying more than the election <i>Y  &rarr;  Z</i>
result-change you caused,
actually was worth to you.  
Bid too low?  Risk not acquiring
the election result you want, even though you could have done so at cost 
below its true worth to you and without decreasing your payment if you have to make one.
</small>
And if the votes indeed are honest, then
this voting system therefore is "perfect" and always elects the best choice, as
measured in (perceived) dollars, for all of society.
<small>Tideman and Tullock
felt obliged to point out that nevertheless their method "would not cure cancer."
</small>
<!-- And this is also true for the Jan Kok modified version. Nope. -->

<p>
<b>Unique features.</b>
This is the only system claiming to result in "perfection" and "voter honesty."
It also is the only one that directly involves <i>money</i>
(and therefore sadly cannot be used in abstract scenarios
in which the "voters" actually  are not money-owning economic entities).
</p>
<p>
<b>Additional work.</b>
For some reason, interest in this scheme
apparently died after 1984 and it was almost entirely forgotten.
(Later note: actually it was not forgotten; a remarkable 2001 
<a href="RVPapers.html">book</a> by Bailey
uses it as a key ingredient.)
One of the last works (besides Bailey) on the matter was by Tideman  who
conducted experiments on actual use of the scheme.
Specifically, Tideman paid several college fraternities
to do their decisions by his process instead of plurality voting for
about 1 year.
Tideman's experiments failed to reach a convincing conclusion.
The fraternity members (polled afterward) preferred plain plurality
voting to Tideman's method,
108-to-56, because of increased administrative work!
But they preferred Tideman (112-to-42)
<i>if</i> the issue-proposer was willing to pay a administration-fee
to get his issue considered by the Tideman method &ndash; <i>but</i> that in fact
never happened during the subsequent year.
</p>
<p>
Tideman's process yielded different decisions than plain
voting in about 10% of the fraternity decisions.  
This led to about 2.25% extra perceived dollar benefit.
However the "Clarke taxes" paid were larger than that 
(namely 3.04%) so in some sense it <i>wasn't</i> worth it.  However, frat houses
are small &ndash; and in larger elections the Clarke taxes would be
comparatively negligible.  Finally, there may have been collusions or other effects
(see criticism list below) which really caused CTT voting to perform even worse, 
and if so Tideman
had no way to know it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Criticisms.</b>
Unfortunately there are several reasons that Clarke-Tideman-Tullock, in practical
use in large elections, would in fact fall considerably short of perfection.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.</b>
In the large elections typical in governments, the probability is extremely
small that any one vote will "make a difference."  (In all the 50,000 or so
US presidential, congressional, and senatorial popular elections so far, there has
<i>never</i> been a case where any single vote has affected the outcome.)
This <i>contrasts</i> mightily with the situation in most auctions (typically there
are 10-20 bidders so each has a reasonable chance &ndash; 1/10 or 1/20 &ndash; of winning)
and in most small fraternity-house elections.  And that contrast, as we shall see next
paragraph, does matter.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b>
In auctioneering and fraternity houses, the problem of bidders not paying,
is a minor problem.  But in nationwide elections in the <i>very rare</i>
instances when payment
was required, there might be a severe nonpayment problem.  Even if all voters were
honest, some would die during the election.  And if 
only one election in a million required the typical voter to pay, that
might encourage a culture of dishonest exaggerated votes, followed on the rare occasions
every 3000 years (!?)
where payment actually <i>was</i> required, by a culture of tax-evasion.  How could voters
be forced to pay?  Throwing the election the other way in response to nonpayment
would not work because the other side also might not pay!  This all could lead
to a nightmare scenario giving a new meaning to the term "election fraud."
</p>
<p>
The problem here is the <i>combination</i> of 1 and 2.
To defeat it 
we could require each voter to submit his payment in "escrow" (to be refunded
in most cases).  That would avoid the nonpayment problem.  However, it would cause
a new problem:  the cost in time, hassle, and interrupted investments to 
place one's money in an escrow account &ndash; a cost greatly and unfairly
varying from person to person --
would vastly exceed the actual expected value
of the Clarke tax.  (If the Clarke tax must be paid 1 time in 40,000 then even missing out
on one day of interest even at only 1% annually, would exceed
the expected value of the Clarke tax.)  
Furthermore, the escrow account set-ups and necessary financial motion
might defeat the goal of <i>secret</i> voting. (And, as with Vickrey auctions,
secrecy is <i>essential</i> to prove the
CTT central claim on which everything rests.)  
<small>
Actually, the fact that all voter-names
are revealed to somebody to cause payment, 
seems to mean that CTT voting is incompatible with ballot secrecy.
</small>
Therefore, in practice the economic
rationale of this sort of voting would
be <i>dominated</i> by these distortionary effects and the CTT goal of
a voting system in which undistorted true utility dominates
would not be achieved at all.
</p>
<small>
<p>
To minimize these effects, the government could give each voter a "free donation" 
of a certain small amount of money into his escrow account, provided he voted, and could
pay interest on the escrow accounts.  These moves would attempt to null-out transaction costs.
However, there would unavoidably be remaining inequities and mismatches in that nulling-out
attempt, which would usually still dominate the true expected utility estimates made by,
and true "costs of voting"  for, each voter.
</p>
<p>
The point of this has been that certain "negligibly small"
effects such as the cost of moving money and cost of voting, while they <i>are</i> negligibly
small in the case of auction of an expensive object, are in fact the <i>most</i>
important thing  in the voting case.
</p>
</small>
<p>
The two problems of auctioneering and voting
might seem almost equivalent except that some numbers are changed, but the
problem is that these numbers change so <i>vastly</i> that
the approximations of certain effects as negligible, become completely invalid.
</p>
<p>
Margolis 1982 made similar points.
He observed that in a typical election situation the expected Clarke tax on a typical voter 
would be
0.00001 penny, and hence expressed doubt that voters would bother to
work out and use their optimum-utility votes.  The transport, money-motion,
and other transaction costs experienced by a typical voter would dwarf this and hence,
rather than being "negligible" would in fact "dominate" the thinking of
rational voters.
</p>
<p>
<b>Pre-deposit idea to combat Margolis' 1982 criticism:</b>
The government would contribute and pre-deposit
into voter escrow accounts, a moderate amount of money &ndash;
enough usually to pay for all transport and time-costs &ndash;
but these moneys would only be available to people who actually voted.
Further, the government would, by law, require bank transfers into and out of your voter-escrow
account to be free of cost (or automatically compensated by the government).
In that case, <i>once a voter has decided to vote</i>, he shuts these transaction costs
out of his mind.  They are no longer relevant; the voter already 
has the money that more-than-covered those
costs.  The voter can now purely concentrate on: what is my best voting decision?
</p>
<p>
<small>Problem is, this does not quite work, because many voters will have moneys tied up
in other forms than bank accounts.</small>
</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b>
Most people would <i>not</i> agree utility is the same thing as money --
even though (economist) Tullock may think it is!
If alternative <i>A</i> leads to a rich man dying while alternative <i>B</i>
kills five
poor men, then CTT voting would choose alternative <i>A</i>.  
More generally
this system might do whatever the rich and
fanatical want, and might exhibit a systematic bias against poor people.
Indeed, for this reason CTT voting is <i>unconstitutional</i>
in the USA under the 24th amendment.
</p>
<p><small>
But recently Professor Marcus Pivato has proposed a way to make CTT voting be truly based 
on utility not money!
Pivato's idea is that the bids not be in terms of money, but rather in terms of
<i>probability</i>.   Suppose we can identify two magic events which we can agree
have about the same utility-difference for
everybody.   When you "pay" the Clarke tax, in Pivato's non-monetary scheme, that now
means you get subjected to a lottery in which the worse-event happens to you with probability P
(where P is your tax) and the better-event with probability 1-P.
To make this work it is essential that the two events be enough-different in utility that they
(for all or almost all voters)
exceed the utility difference arising from who gets elected.
(Otherwise we get "truncation effects" distorting the picture.)
</small></p>
<p>
<b>4.</b>
The Clarke taxes would in fact be paid into government funds which would
then be used to reduce (ordinary) taxes.  Hence in reality the
<i>true</i> amount voters would effectively pay, would differ from the Clarke tax.
That in practice would distort the system away from the ideal of
employing "perfect utilities."  (One nightmare: consider a candidate whose platform was
"if elected, I will refund all Clarke taxes.")
</p>
<p>
<small>One suggestion to combat(?) that criticism is to award all the Clarke taxes to
one randomly selected voter, the "Clarke-tax lottery winner."</small>
</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b>
Collusions: Suppose "Nixon"
bids some enormous amount of money and "Agnew" also does,
to make the Nixon-Agnew ticket win.   Now, each of  {Nixon, Agnew}
alone did not change the election result because their bids were each vastly huger than
everybody else in the country combined, so Nixon could argue "I would
have been elected anyway thanks to Agnew's bid" therefore
Nixon pays zero Clarke tax.  Similarly Agnew also pays zero and both get elected for free.
This pathology could reduce everything to 2-man teams of colluders each trying to "name the
largest number they can" &ndash; which would be a ridiculous dysfunctional state of affairs.
</p>
<p>
However, this Nixon-Agnew criticism largely
falls to the ground if <i>escrowed</i> vote moneys are demanded.
That makes ridiculously large bids impossible.
But that, as we said, leads
to other difficulties.  (Another related to #3 is: what if my utility exceeds the amount of
money I am able to raise in cash form?<small>
Consider abortion rights.
Jill in losing her abortion rights, is losing a lot of expected dollars.
The ratio of abortions to live births was approximately 32:100 in the 1990s USA.
Suppose it costs $100,000 to birth and raise a child but only $300 to get an
abortion (1990s dollars).
Suppose Jill is going to have 3 children and hence (on average) one abortion.
That means $100,000 of expected utility is at stake for her if there is a vote
on a law that would make it impossible for her to abort. 
(Actually she could
still try
to get an abortion in a foreign country, or try to abandon her child for
adoption, so
it is less than $100,000, but we shall ignore that.) 
But more utility is
at stake the younger Jill is. 
However, the younger Jill is, the less likely she has
$100,000 to vote with!
Now on the other side are the moralists who believe
abortion is murder. 
From their view, it is worth all the money some fetus would
ever be able to earn, to avoid being murdered.  
However... fetuses don't have
any money and can't vote. 
So it appears both sides in this issue
are going to regard the CTT voting system as unfairly biased against them
and invalid.
How do CTT-proponents answer them?
</small>)  
</p>
<p>
<b>New randomization idea to reduce the collusion problem:</b>
Suppose every vote-bid <i>X</i>
is automatically <i>replaced</i>, before doing the election,
with a <i>random number</i> in the interval <i>[0, 2X]</i> with <i>mean</i> <i>X</i>.
<small>
(The problem of making everybody confident the randomizations were genuine, independent,
and unbiased, while keeping everything secret until the end, is a solvable cryptographic problem.)
</small>
One possible probability distribution would be the two-mass one with either <i>0</i>
or <i>2X</i>
chosen by a coin flip.
</p>
<p>
This idea has the disadvantage that it adds extra "noise" to the election
and that it can stick unlucky voters with a higher than-expected Clarke tax bill
(although they could compensate by underbidding by a constant factor).  
But its advantage &ndash; and point &ndash;
is that it causes the Nixon-Agnew collusion we just described to become
<i>very risky</i>.  
Randomization causes your collusion-teammates to become
effectively "untrustworthy" even if they actually were totally loyal.
</p>
<p>
<b>Counterattack:</b>
With 100 colluders, it becomes exceedingly unlikely (probability 100&middot;2<sup>-99</sup>)
that any colluder will be forced to pay.  So the colluders by organizing moderately large
teams can defeat this idea.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally,
Margolis in 1983 tried to argue using differential equations 
that the CTT scheme was the essentially <i>unique</i>
one with its properties.  Margolis unfortunately did
not actually state an explicit theorem with proof,
but suffice it to say that Margolis was <i>wrong</i> in the sense that we have just exhibited
this randomization generalization
<!-- Jan Kok's <i>X</i>-generalization NO GOOD -->
constituting an infinite number of ways to generalize CTT.
So no, CTT is not unique at all, but yes, it is unique if we restrict to deterministic
voting schemes in which voter payments are made as small as possible.
</p>
<p>
<b>Other ideas to reduce the collusion problem:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Require "reasonable" bids: e.g. the top 5% highest bids could be collapsed to the same amount.
</li><li>
Randomly split the voters into 3 groups.
All 3 groups are likely to agree on a winner. However, if only 2
agree, then both those 2 groups have to pay. 
This is a different randomization 
technique but with the same goal of making collusions become risky.
(Of course, this might work even better with more than three groups.
Having more groups makes collusions more risky, but also makes the election more noisy and less
ideal.)
</li>
</ol>
These ideas may slightly destroy the mathematical
"perfection" of the CTT scheme, but it may be worth the
sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
<b>6.</b>
Howard Margolis  offered another criticism:
which is that voter "ancillary utilities" (<small>Margolis called it "altruism,"
but Professor Marcus Pivato convinced me that was a 
bad name and "ancillary utilities" is a better name</small>)
would invalidate CTT.
That is,
in many cases the amount of money at stake for each voter is small, so
that voter is willing to be altruistic and lose money to further what he
considers to be a good cause.  Or that voter simply gets a certain amount of joy
simply from pulling the voting lever, which is <i>not</i>  the expected amount of joy she gets from
the chance that vote will alter the election winner.  The problem is this "ancillary utility"
is likely to far-exceed the utility CTT is trying to measure.
</p><p>
That seems to me to be an excellent and
completely valid criticism: 
the only reason almost
anybody votes at all, is "altruism"/"ancillary utilities"
since it is totally economically irrational
to vote considering the cost in time and transport to vote versus the low probability
of that vote having an election-swinging effect.
So ancillary utilities (aka economic irrationality) are not "negligible"; they are
the "dominant" effect in voting!  
Given any such huge distortionary effect on utilities, CTT's claims of "perfection"
fall to the ground.  
</p>
<p>
The net effect of all these criticisms is very serious and probably render the  
Clarke-Groves-Tideman-Tullock voting system practically useless 
(or at least uncompetitive enough to remove it from consideration) for
large governmental elections.
<small>
</small> 
CTT also is useless for (or at least dubious for) small
elections such as in Tideman's frat house study (since for them the Clarke taxes exceed
the benefit of switching to the system).  
However, for elections of <i>intermediate</i> size
(500-50000 voters?) and in which utility <i>does</i> closely correspond with money,
and assuming the collusion problem is overcome,
this system may make excellent sense.  
(<b>Stockholder elections in corporations</b>, with Clarke taxes donated to charity?) 
It might also make sense if future
techno/political developments alter the nature of "money" so that large anonymous
and undetectable monetary transfers become easy and cheap.
