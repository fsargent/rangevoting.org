<h2> Range Voting "threshhold strategy" made easy &ndash; and a surprising lesson </h2>

<p><small> by Clay Shentrup 2008 </small> </p>

<p>
<a href="RVstrat3.html">Analysis</a> 
<a href="RVstrat7.html">suggests</a> 
that best Range/Approval Voting strategy is
to give a max score to all candidates you like better than the expected value of the winner, and 
min-score the others. With Approval Voting, that just means "vote for the 
candidates you like better than the expected value of the winner."
</p>
<h4> Example </h4>

<p>
Say my sincere normalized preferences for the candidates in the 2008 Democratic 
presidential primary were:
<br><center>
Dodd=10, Gravel=9, Obama=8, Richardson=6, Kucinich=5, Biden=3, Edwards=1, Clinton=0
</center><br>
Then I would assign probabilities to the winners 
(based on current polling and primary results) like:
<br><br><center>
Obama=45%, Clinton=43%, Edwards=12%, the rest effectively 0%
</center><br>
If I wanted to be really unbiased, I could even look at the trading prices on web sites 
where people play the 
"candidate stock market" (i.e. gamble). But going with this rough estimate, I 
calculate my expected
value from the winner to be:
<br><br><center>
.45 &times; 8 + .43 &times; 0 + .12 &times; 1 = 3.72
</center><br>
So if I were <a href="RVstrat7.html">maximally strategic</a>,
I would want to vote for every candidate I like more than 3.72, as follows:
<br><br><center>
Dodd, Gravel, Obama, Richardson, Kucinich
</center><br>
</p>

<h4> About the "singleton (<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>-style) voting" myth </h4>

<p>
It is totally false to claim that the best approval-style vote is always to
vote for <i>one</i> candidate.   It <i>is</i> the best way to vote if your utility for electing
your favorite candidate, is <i>tremendously</i> higher than for every other.
But that is generally not the case &ndash; and it is totally false to claim real-world voters 
will act that way.  To prove that:
</p><p>
NES polling data shows
approximately 90% of the voters who claimed their favorite was Nader in 2000 
strategically voted for someone else, suggesting that the vast 
majority of voters care more about maximizing their effect on the election than on 
getting their favorite elected at all costs.
</p>

<h4> No math skills? </h4>

<p>
If you're a little cynical about the math skills (or at least the math enjoyment) of the average voter,
you're not alone. It is reasonable to expect that many Approval Voting users would mistakenly vote 
sub-optimally &ndash;  especially when there are 3 or more strong candidates.
</p>
<p>
Now <a href="RVstrat3.html">consider</a>
that a sincere Range Voting ballot has about 91% (or more) of the effectiveness of a 
perfectly strategic vote (in the 3-candidate study; 80% or more in the 5-candidate case), 
and <i>it  requires essentially no thought</i>
and no math.
</p>
<p>
So there's a case that
a rational (but not necessarily mathematically inclined or ambitious) 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/Approval/html">Approval Voting</a> user 
often would rather just cast a sincere  <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range Voting</a> ballot.
</p>

<p>
Sincere range-voting <i>can</i> however be poor strategy in cases where there are two front-runners
whose utilities are (in the voter's view) close together.  But in that case a good strategy 
(which happens still to be fairly sincere) again is
pretty obvious:
a voter would be "safe"  just to polarize the two
front-runners and keep her other scores honest. 
For example, if in the above Clinton &amp; Obama were regarded as the "front runners"
with the only good winning chances, then
a voter adopting the "polarization+honesty" strategy would
vote maximum for Dodd, Gravel, and Obama; minimum for Clinton, and
scaled in between for Richardson, Kucinich, Biden, and Edwards.
</p>

<h4> (Surprising) Conclusion </h4>

<p>
Some critics have argued that range voting may trick unsuspecting naive voters into foolishly casting
honest (and hence strategically weak) votes.
But, contrariwise,  range voting can
also actually <i>help</i> such voters by allowing them to cast a strategically fairly-good
vote with no effort.
</p>

<p>
Certain people constantly criticize range voting as
"just like taking approval voting and trying to dupe the naive into casting weak votes,"
which is "unfair."  My point is, on the average, people quite-possibly are <i>better</i> off
using range than using approval, if
you consider how often people may 
use 
approval voting
sub-optimally.
