<H2> Third parties endorsing IRV (<a href="rangeVirv.html">Instant Runoff Voting</a>) &ndash;
the act of a suicidal idiot? </H2>

<p>
Sorry to jar you with that
"suicidal idiot" remark.
It was intended to connote the following
3-step process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Some third parties, like the <a href="http://www.gp.org">Greens</a>, believe the voting
system has to change or they will have no chance for power.
</li><li>
So they thought of switching to IRV.
</li><li>
But IRV <i>also</i> leads to <a href="Duverger.html">self-reinforcing 2-party domination</a> as
is shown both <a href="IRVpartic.html">theoretically</a>, 
and also in practice
based on about 80 years of experience in 
<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>,
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a>,
and
<a href="MaltaPol.html">Malta</a>.
(And Australian political analysts simply take this fact as well known.
There is no debate.)
</li></ol>
<p>
So the Greens were good on step #1, but #2 was "idiotic" because they
did not bother to find out #3.  This is actually a classic logic trap
(IRV <i>sounds</i> like
it gets rid of 2-party domination, but actually it does 
not &ndash; that is what
I mean by a "logic trap."   It is an easy logic trap to extricate yourself from,
though, if you just do the most incredibly simple research to find out
what happened in the country &ndash; Australia &ndash; with by far the most IRV experience.
But the logic trap is so appealing that the Greens did not bother to do that
incredibly obvious square-one research.)
And it was "suicidally" idiotic because their life as a viable
political party is
being sacrificed by making this wrong choice.
</p>
<p>
Remember, if you are a third party, built-in 2-party domination equals political death for you.
Given that we are talking about your death &ndash; don't you think it is worth doing what it
takes to understand this?
