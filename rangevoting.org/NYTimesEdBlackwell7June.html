<H2> NY TIMES EDITORIAL "Block the vote, Ohio" 7 June 2006 </H2>

<p>
If there was ever a sign of a ruling party in trouble, it is a game plan that 
calls for trying to 
win by discouraging voting. 
</p><p>
The latest sign that Republicans have an election-year strategy to shut down 
voter 
registration drives comes from Ohio. As the state gears up for a very 
competitive election 
season this fall, its secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, has put in place 
&quot;emergency&quot; 
regulations that could hit voter registration workers with criminal penalties 
for perfectly 
legitimate registration practices. The rules are so draconian they could shut 
down 
registration drives in Ohio. 
</p><p>
Mr. Blackwell, who also happens to be the Republican candidate for governor this 
year, has 
a history of this sort of behavior. In 2004, he instructed county boards of 
elections to 
reject any registrations on paper of less than 80-pound stock.
This came under 
intense criticism. It was, however, in place long enough to get some 
registrations tossed 
out.</p><p>
 
This year, Mr. Blackwell's office has issued rules and materials that appear to 
require that 
paid registration workers, and perhaps even volunteers, <i>personally</i> take the 
forms they 
collect to an election office. Organizations that run registration drives 
generally have the 
people who register voters bring the forms back to supervisors, who can then 
review them 
for errors. Under Mr. Blackwell's edict, everyone involved could be committing a 
crime. Mr. 
Blackwell's rules also appear to prohibit people who register voters from 
sending the 
forms in by mail. That rule itself may violate federal elections law. 
</p><p>
Mr. Blackwell's rules are interpretations of a law the Republican-controlled 
Ohio 
Legislature passed recently. Another of the nation's most famous swing states, 
Florida, has 
been the scene of similar consternation and confusion since it recently enacted 
a law that 
is so harsh that the Florida League of Women Voters announced that it was 
stopping all 
voter registration efforts for the first time in 67 years. 
</p><p>
Florida's Legislature, like Ohio's, is controlled by Republicans. Throughout 
American 
history both parties have shown a willingness to try to use election law to get 
results they 
might otherwise not win at the polls. But right now it is clearly the 
Republicans who 
believe they have an interest in keeping the voter base small. Mr. Blackwell and 
other 
politicians who insist on making it harder to vote never say, of course, that 
they are 
worried that get-out-the-vote drives will bring too many poor and minority 
voters into the 
system. They say that they want to reduce fraud. However, there is virtually no 
evidence 
that registration drives are leading to fraud at the polls. 
</p><p>
But there is one clear way that Ohio's election system is corrupt. Decisions 
about who can 
vote are being made by a candidate for governor. Mr. Blackwell should hand over 
responsibility for elections to a decision maker whose only loyalty is to the 
voters and the 
law.</p>
