<h3>
My personal top three objections to IRV
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
It leads to massive self-reinforcing
2-party domination (same as now) probably
partly due to the <a href="#favbet">IRV spoiler effect</a>
and partly due to the theorem that if there are enough
voters who always "naively" rank the two major-party 
contenders top &amp; bottom to intuitively "maximize their vote's impact,"
then a third-party candidate can never win.
<br>
With huge 2-party domination, "improved" voting systems are largely irrelevant.
</li><li>
Also 
<a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
studies indicate range voting is very robustly superior.
</li><li>
In view of the above plus the facts <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>
is simpler (especially in its <a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a> simplified form), 
less <a href="SPRates.html">error-prone</a> for voters,
countable in precincts (IRV <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">isn't</a>),
countable on ordinary voting machines, less prone to nasty pathologies, and
less prone to <a href="TieRisk.html">ties</a>
and "chad-counting nightmares," <i>why</i> would you possibly prefer IRV?
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<i>Common</i> Pathologies
</h3>

<p>
In what I call the <a href="RandElect.html">random elections model</a>,
(which is a rather crude probability model,
but in my experience the results you get from it are
surprisingly valid in real life)...
<br>
the two most common IRV pathologies seem to be "favorite betrayal"
and "participation" failures.
</p>

<a name="favbet"></a>
<p>
In <b>Favorite Betrayal</b> [probably the most important-in-practice kind of <b>spoiler</b>],
it is unstrategic to vote for your true favorite top.  
In this model
that happens <a href="IRVStratPf.html#irv">19.6%</a>
of the time (for at least one kind of voters) in 3-candidate elections.
There is a nice exact formula for 19.6% namely arccot(&radic;2)/&pi;.
</p>
<blockquote><small>
Also for strategic voters acting on <i>imperfect</i> information, it
happens, arguably, <i>100%</i> of the time!  That argument is based on the theory that,
if a voter <i>does not know</i> whether the IRV-spoiler scenario will arise
(but figures it will with probability &asymp;19.6%)
but <i>does</i> know that historically with IRV, one of the two major-party candidates wins
with probability&gt;99.7%, said voter would probably consider it rational to vote
one major top, other major bottom, even if that voter honestly prefers a third-party candidate.
If voters do this, then the 19.6% IRV-spoiler risk is avoided, but at the cost of
sacrificing the &lt;0.3% chance to elect the good third-party candidate.  This sacrifice
seems worth the benefit, on average.   But it is a theorem that if &gt;75% of
voters adopt this top+bottom "naive exaggeration" voting strategy, then it becomes mathematically
impossible for a third-party candidate to win... thus amplifying the pathology in a vicious 
cycle...
<br><br>
However, this "100%" theory has been (justifiably) attacked by Jameson Quinn as resting on a 
probabilistic delusion.  E.g. if majors are winning 
with probability&gt;99.7% (which they have, historically, in the Australian House in 
recent decades) that means
the "random election model" and the 19.6% spoiler probability estimate were <i>wrong</i>;
in a more-correct voting model, 
the spoiler-risk is much lower, thereby incentivizing honest voting.
However, the more honest voters there are, the more the 
"random election model" becomes correct again... so one might expect an "equilibrium"
might develop.   It would be interesting to examine that mathematically, but as a matter of 
<i>reality</i> rather than mathematical models, the fact is, the last three Australian House
elections
(2001, 2004, 2007) combined elected zero out of 450 third-party-member seatholders despite 
an average of about 7 candidates per seat.

<p>
<b>Concrete examples:</b>
<a href="IRVcs.html">simple</a>,
<a href="TarrIrv.html">realistic</a>,
<a href="ClayIrv3.html">unusual structure</a>,
<a href="ClayIrv2.html">Jeez Louise</a>.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally these refute the false but unfortunately common claim that IRV "eliminates"
the "spoiler" and "wasted vote" defects of plurality voting.
</p>

<p>
In <b>Participation Failure,</b>
the election is such that if you were to add <i>t</i> more co-voting honest voters,
(for some <i>t</i> and some vote-type) then the election result would get worse
from their point of view, i.e. they were "better off staying home."
This happens 16.2% of the time in 3-candidate elections, see
my preliminary write-up 
<a href="PuzzIrvPartic.html">here</a>;
and also, according to analysis by Depankar Ray,
exactly <a href="IRVpartic.html#depankar">50% of the time</a>
in 3-candidate elections in which the IRV and plurality winners differ.
</p>
<p>
<small>
("16.2%" ought to be expressible in close form also, but  have not tried;
not sure how simple you could get it.   I also can semi-prove
participation failure
happens with probability&rarr;1  in the limit of a large number of random voters and
large number of candidates, for two Condorcet methods.   What happens
to these two pathology probabilities for IRV in the limit of a large number C of candidates?
I do not know.  It certainly increases with C.
There might be an easy argument it goes to 1?)
</small>
</p>

</p><p>
There are additional nasties concerning 
<a href="IRV3.html">"top-3 only" bastardized IRV</a>
which are
<a href="IrvExhaustionSF.html">very common in real life</a>.
</p>

<h3><i>Less Common</i> IRV pathologies </h3>

<p>
For examples of IRV <b>refusing to elect Condorcet ("beats-all")
winners</b>, as happened
in <a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006</a>, 
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a>,
France 2007, and Chile 1970, see these:
<a href="CoreSupp.html">core</a>,
<a href="CoreSuppPocket.html">simpler</a>,
<a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">nasty</a>,
<a href="IRV1519.html">another</a>.
We can make this <a href="PuzzlePage.html#prob18">very extreme</a>.
But this pathology is fairly rare in the random elections model; it happens
about 3.7% of the time (see 
<a href="PuzzlePage.html">puzzle 17</a>).
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, both 
this and <a href="IrvRevFail.html">IRV reversal failure</a> totally refute the
false but unfortunately common claim that IRV "always elects true-majority winners."
</p>
<a name="1D"></a>
<p>
This pathology is however <b>considerably <i>more common</i></b> in "1-dimensional politics"
(and "2-dimensional politics," see
<a href="IrvExtreme.html">pictures</a> where it happens
about 25% of the time), hence it perhaps was wrong of me to label it as "less common."
</p>
<p>
Here is a simple and mildly interesting model of 1-dimensional politics.
Assume 3-candidates (A, B, and C) and all 4 "singlepeaked 1-dimensional" votes are
equally likely:
A>B>C, C>B>A, B>A>C, B>C>A &ndash; except the latter two have half the likelihood
just to keep things interesting &ndash; yielding a 3-way near-tie in top rank votes.
Note, this model is precisely regarding <i>all</i>  "interesting" 1D-politics elections
as equally likely, where "interesting" means all 3 candidates have a chance &ndash; not
just a 2-man race &ndash; and "1D" means the candidates A,B,C are three points on a line
in that order, and the only votes that can happen are orderings of the three
points in increasing-distance (from someplace) order.
</p><p>
<a name="csqueeze"></a>
<b>Question:</b>
In this cheesy 1D model (in the limit of a large number of independent random voters)
what are the probabilities IRV yields a favorite betrayal scenario, or a
"center squeeze" scenario where the middle candidate B is not elected by
IRV despite being a Condorcet winner?
</p>
<p><b>Answers:</b>
<ul>
<li>
A favorite-betrayal succeeds 1/3 of the time &ndash; whenever A or C win, the opposite camp
finds it strategic to betray their man and rank the "lesser evil" B artificially top.
</li><li>
Center squeeze: B is the Condorcet winner asymptotically 100% of the time
but wins only 2/3 of the time, so this squeeze problem happens 1/3 of the time.
</li>
<!-- <li>
 Participation failure:  I think it asymp'ly has probability zero?
</li> -->
</ul>

<p>
A <a href="Aus07.html">look</a>
at Australia's federal IRV races in 2007 suggests at least 9
of the 150 were pathological, probably in this sort of center-squeeze fashion
<small>
(we cannot tell with certainty <i>which</i>
pathology happened because Australia refuses to
provide full-enough election information to allow us to reconstruct the ballots,
but as the
<a href="Aus07.html"> analysis</a>
shows we can still deduce the presence of <i>either</i> paradox A <i>or</i> paradox B
in many elections...)</small>
and probably more.
</p>

<p>
IRV <a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a> 
[raising X in your vote decreases X's winning
chances &ndash; or lowering X in your vote increases his winnign chances]: 
this happens with probability (2.3+12.2=14.5)% in 3-candidate
large random elections (there are two disjoint kinds of nonmonotonicity, 
"winner now loses" and "loser now wins"
hence the two numbers; also Schl&auml;fli function method explained in
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p4">puzzle #4</a>).
<br>
That same page shows that in 
N-candidate elections with N large, IRV becomes overwhelmingly likely to suffer non-monotonicity.
<br>
<a href="RichieRV.html#ex17">Concrete example</a>.
Also occurred in
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington 2009</a>.
</p><p>
This also can occur in 
<a href="IrvHurtFav.html">extreme forms</a>
where e.g. raising X all the way from bottom to
top causes X to lose.
(Another 
<a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">example</a>;
see point 5 there). Here's a related
<a href="ClayIrv2.html">weird phenomenon</a>.
</p><p>
For IRV <b>reversal failure</b> where IRV's "best winner" is the same as IRV's "worst loser,"
see
<a href="IrvRevFail.html">this</a>;
it happens about 
<a href="IrvRFfreq.html">2.6%</a> of the time in random 
3-candidate elections. 
</p><blockquote><small>
In the "cheesy 1D model" above, an "extremist"
A or C always wins the vote-reversed election.  
The forward-vote election is won by the opposite extremist when B is eliminated,
any by B when either A or C is eliminated, hence the forward and reverse winners
are equal <i>zero</i> percent of the time asymptotically 
and reversal failure is almost a nonproblem in that model.

<h3> A structural problem: Non-additivity &rArr; IRV cannot be counted in precincts </h3>
<p>
You can't count IRV elections in precincts because there is no such
thing as a "precinct subtotal"
(at least nothing that can be recorded in any form much more compact than just listing all
the votes in that precinct, if there are a reasonable number such as 13 of candidates).
Here is a web page to make that clear:
