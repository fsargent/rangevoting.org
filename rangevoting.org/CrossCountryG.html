<H2> Cross-Country Gerrymandering comparison </H2>

<p>
We were interested in the question of which countries are the best and the worst
as far as gerrymandering is concerned.  So we started examining 
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/">2000-2005 election district maps</a>
from 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/c/canada/canadamapsindex.shtml">Canada</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/_content/Who/profiles/state.htm">Australia</a>
(<a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2013/profiles/index.htm">updated</a>
link),
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/g/germany/germanymapsindex.shtml">Germany</a>,
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/b/britain/britainmapsindex.shtml">Britain</a>, 
<a href="http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/i/india/indiamapsindex.shtml">India</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd108_gen/ind_pdf/">USA</a>.
(Out of 435 US House seats, only 10 elections were decided by a margin below 5% in 2004)
<!-- in 2000 election only 57 of the House's 435 seats were decided by margins of &le;10% -->
</li>
</ol>

<H3> And the results are... </H3>

<p>
The countries above were listed in order of increasing gerrymandering.  Canada is the best
(gerrymandering almost nonexistent),
and the USA is the worst (huge blatant gerrymandering).
We do not have any numbers.  This is simply based on looking at a lot of maps and measuring
how far the observer's jaw drops.
</p>

<p>
<i>Canada</i>
seems amazingly impressively honest (at least as of year 2005).
The district boundaries are often rivers or straight lines
and hence seem utterly unchallengeable.
Canada seems to be by far the best country of the above
about avoiding Gerrymandering.
</p>

<H3> How do those Canucks do it? </H3>

<p>
The Canadians have an "independent non-partisan agency" to draw districts
<a href="http://www.elections.ca">("Elections Canada")</a>.
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, the Chief Electoral Officer, appointed 1990 to serve
until age 65 or resignation, is Canada's best paid civil servant.
This post is appointed directly
by parliament and reports to them.
The <acronym>C.E.O.</acronym> can be removed from office only for cause, by the Governor General
after a joint request following a majority vote by the
House of Commons and Senate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Discussion: could the USA do something similar?</b>
Idea: the USA could or should have a similar federal post
who would choose the districts inside all the states (following Canada's lead).
The states themselves should be forbidden to district themselves.
He/she should be appointed <i>not</i> by the president and should <i>not</i>
report to the president, but to congress.
<!-- and
indeed I would prefer he be chosen by a <i>supermajority</i> vote of
both houses of congress. -->
(Another idea: hire the Canadians to do our districting...)
</p>

<p>
This would all be good but the problem is...
<ol>
<li>
this would probably be an unconstitutional denial of "state's rights."
</li><li>
that everything would then rest on the integrity of this one person.
</li></ol>
Although this approach has worked for Canada so far... it still makes us unhappy.
We prefer the <a href="GerryExamples.html">shortest-splitline algorithm</a>
method of avoiding gerrymandering, since then we do not have to trust <i>anyone</i>.
