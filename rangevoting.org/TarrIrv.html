<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>

<p>
In this 100-voter example election, under IRV, <b>"Worst" wins</b>.
("Middling," with the fewest top-rank votes, is eliminated in the first round
then Worst wins 55 to 45 over "Best".)  This is a fairly <i>realistic</i> scenario
of the sort that arises with voters and candidates positioned along a one-dimensional line.
</p>

<p>
Now suppose
eight voters in the bottom faction cleverly (but dishonestly) switch their top-two
preference order.
Result:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> Their (new) Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td align="center">
    45
</td>
<td>
Worst>Middling>Best
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    10 
<td>
Middling>Worst>Best
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#e8ff99">
<td align="center">
  <b>18</b>
<td>
Middling>Best>Worst
</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#dfffcc">
<td align="center">
  <b>27</b>
<td>
Best>Middling>Worst
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Then the IRV election proceeds differently:
"Best" is eliminated in the <i>first</i> round,
and then in the second round <b>"Middling" wins</b> over "Worst" 73-to-27.
From those 8 voters' point of view, this was an improvement.
</p>

<p>
<b>The moral</b> is:
Dishonest voting ("exaggeration") pays.  These 8 voters of course regarded
the candidates to be ordered 
Best>Middling>Worst (the candidate-names have been chosen to
reflect their point of view).
<i>But</i> they realized that honesty in their vote wasn't going to work:
"Worst" was going to win.  They saw that "Best" had no chance of winning.
So then they <b>"betrayed" Best</b> by intentionally ranking him second
and dishonestly ranking "Middling" top.  This tactical move
allowed the "lesser evil" Middling to win instead of Worst.
<small>
(Incidentally, they also could have changed their vote to the even-more-dishonest
"Middling>Worst>Best"; that also would have been a tactical success.)
</small>
</P>

<p>
The phenomenon in this example goes a long way toward explaining why it is
that <b>all three IRV countries are (and historically have been)
2-party dominated.</b>  Voters figure
the third party has no chance and they are best off exaggerating their
view of the top two parties so as not to "waste their vote".
As you can see both
from this and the <a href="IncentToExagg.html">other example</a>, 
in IRV that strategy often works.  <i>But</i> if enough voters act this way,
then third party candidates can never win an IRV election since they'll be
eliminated in early rounds!
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally, there is 
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">another example</a> which works for both IRV and the "BTR-IRV"
system.  So please do not expect  BTR-IRV is going to
save you from all this.
<a href="IRVpartic.html">Another (simpler) example</a>.
And <a href="IRVcs.html">another</a>.
And <a href="IrvHurtFav.html">another</a>.)
<!-- Incidentally, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">wikipedia article</a> 
on Condorcet voting falsely claimed acyclic examples such as this are impossible
in Condorcet voting methods &ndash; but BTR-IRV <i>is</i> a Condorcet voting method!) 
No! WikiP is right! Acyclic ==> is a CW ==> he wins ==> betrayal of best in this situation 
cannot help -->
</p>

<p>
This example directly contradicts the false claim commonly 
made by proponents of IRV voting
that IRV "eliminates the problem of wasted votes."
Some third parties such as the USA's Green Party have actually <i>endorsed</i>  IRV,
not realizing that was a suicidal move which would simply
preserve the present USA state of 2-party domination.   We hope they
instead choose a course aiming toward survival, such as adopting <i>Range Voting</i>.
</p>

<H3> Still not convinced? </H3>

<p>
Maybe you object that this example sounds <i>rare</i> and contrived and unlikely
to occur in practice.  (If so, you are <a href="IRVStratPf.html#irv">wrong</a>.
And in fact a betrayal-pays scenario like this recently
happened in <a href="Peru06.html">Peru</a>.)
But that does not matter much.
What matters in the eyes of these 8 voters is: 
<i>Which is more likely?</i>
<ol>
<li>
That the third-party candidate "Best" is going to be elected, but
if we betray him
by making this strategic dishonest voting move, we'll foolishly prevent that.
</li>
<li>
That our making this move will successfully  cause "Middling" to win.
</li>
</ol>
See, our 8 voters <i>don't know</i> what the other voters are going to do.
They cannot see the whole table.
They can only guess roughly.  So they cannot be sure which vote is
the best &ndash; the honest one, or the altered one.  So they have to
assess the <i>chances.</i>  In the USA, third party candidates win less than
1% of the time, historically.   As I write this in 2005, there
is exactly one member of the 435-strong
US House of Representatives who is non-Democrat
and non-Republican.  (Bernie Sanders.)   In the 150-member
Australian house (elected by IRV!) during
2004 &amp; 2007, the total number of House seats owned by third parties was zero out of 300.
So it is reasonable for our 8 voters
to believe the chances of the third-party candidate "Best" winning are very small.  
But the chances of "Middling" winning are quite large, historically about 50%.
Now factor in the probability that a situation like the one in the table
(where exaggeration pays) is going to arise.  Reasonably probable &ndash; situation
illustrated, as we said, is pretty realistic for 1-dimensional "left" to "right"
approximate political situation. <b>Conclusion:</b>  Even if  situations like the one
we illustrated
<i>are</i> so rare they only happen 5% of the time, then it <i>still</i> is strategically
the right move <i>always</i>, 
when <i>chances</i> are considered, to exaggerate in your IRV vote.
</p>

<p> 
So the rarity objection won't cut it.  As they say down South, "that dog won't hunt."
</p>

<a name="facts">
<H3> Logic isn't enough for you? Try facts. </H3>
<p>
Maybe you think I'm a dangerous mathematician type who can wave his magic arguments to 
convince you of anything, but you aren't going to buy it.  Nope, logical arguments 
aren't going to be enough for you.
</P>

<p>
Fine.  Then forget logical arguments and take a look at IRV <i>reality.</i>
No theory &ndash; just the facts ma'am.
</p>

<p>
The facts are there are three IRV countries: 
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a> (mandated in their 1937 constitution),
<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>
(adopted STV in the early 1900s, but in 1949 added "reweighting" to
STV in their multi-winner elections, a change which does not matter for us
since we are only considering single-winner elections &ndash; Australia and Ireland
have <i>both</i> kinds of elections), and
<a href="MaltaPol.html">Malta</a>.
(Later note: a recent addition is
<a href="FijiPol.html">Fiji</a>, but it unfortunately 
then got subtracted due to a 2006 coup.)
</p>

<p>
All three became 2-party dominated in their IRV seats.
And this is <i>despite</i> the fact that in addition to IRV single-winner
elections, they all also have multi-winner 
STV "<a href="PropRep.html">proportional representation</a>" (PR)
elections, and they are parliamentary rather than presidential.
Both of these two factors mitigate toward having more than 2 parties
(the parliamentary countries with PR essentially all have many more than 2
vibrant political parties).  But <i>despite</I> those multiparty-genic
factors, the effect of IRV in these countries has been enough to drag them
back down to 2-party domination status!
So given that, you can bet your bottom dollar that the USA, were
it to adopt IRV but still to remain presidential and without multiwinner PR elections
(i.e. wholy with  single-winner elections), will <i>definitely</i> stay 2-party dominated.
</p>

<H3> Third parties, are you listening? Hello? </H3>

<p>
We sure hope so.  Because it is your survival at stake.  Get it right.  Do
not advocate IRV like a <a href="SuicidalIdiot.html">suicidal idiot</a>.
