<H2> David Cobb gets it wrong about Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) </H2>

<p>
David Cobb (Green party candidate for US President 2004, in response to 
the top questions from slashdot.org; our italics):
</p>

<blockquote>
Instant Runoff Voting will be used in San Francisco this November and a number of other cities and counties have approved of using it or are considering doing so. Instant Runoff Voting, or IRV, 
<i>solves</i> the perceived <i>"spoiler" problem</i>
because you can vote for all the candidates you like; 
<i>you don't have to make a lesser-evil choice.</i> 
I encourage people to learn more about IRV at Center for Voting and Democracy.
</blockquote>

<p>
Good intentions David! &ndash; but factually incorrect, as you can see from the
<a href="Peru06.html">Peru 2006 election</a> 
&ndash; which occurred soon after Cobb uttered that
wishful quote &ndash;
where Humala voters, by voting for their true favorite candidate,
caused, under runoff (or IRV), their
greatest-evil worst-choice candidate to win.
If they'd only voted for their lesser-evil Flores instead of their true favorite,
then she'd have won.  Gee, I guess that was exactly the sort of "spoiler scenario"
Cobb here, fueled by propaganda from the CVD, was wrongly
claiming impossible under IRV.
Oops.
