<H2> Mexico's 2006 presidential election </H2>

<p>
"According to our statistics, we have won the presidency," Andres M.L. Obrador roared Sunday
night. "The triumph is irreversible."
But just over half an hour later, Felipe Calderon of the ruling National Action Party (PAN)
announced "there is no doubt we have won."
</p>
<p>
So both claimed victory.
Pre-election polls had seemed to give it to Obrador but his advantage over
Calderon kept shrinking as the election approached.
The <a href="NYTmexRec.html">preliminary official figures</a>
gave it to Calderon by a 1.04% margin. 
Later, the IFE said Obrador was in the lead, then later
[4:00am Mexico City time on 6 July] the IFE claimed that 97.70% of the votes
had been counted and Calderon was again leading Obrador by 0.01%: 35.60% to 35.59%!
Later on 6 July the IFE claimed Calderon had won by 243,000 votes
(i.e. about a 0.6% margin) by 35.9% to 35.3%, with 99.6% of the votes counted
so that the margin was irreversible (but counting continued).  
Obrador then announced he was
going to demand a recount because there were "many irregularities" and there
was a 100,000-strong demonstration in Mexico City on 8 July 
(then a million-strong one on 17 July) protesting his loss.

<p>
Calderon is the conservative, Vicente Fox's picked successor, and openly
supported by
US president G.W. Bush. 
Obrador is the leftist. 
However, a more-leftist leftist (i.e. actually
feminist
and willing to say things against the Catholic church...) was Patricia Mercado,
who
got about 3% of the vote. 
So clearly Mercado was the "Nader" in this
race who threw the election to Calderon when it "should" have gone to Obrador.
</p>
<p>
However, that assessment ignores the PRI candidate Roberto Madrazo, who was in
third
place with about 22%. The PRI was the party that held Mexico for decades in
thrall of
corrupt single-party rule, and which had previously defeated Obrador in a
massively
corruptly rigged elections in 1988 and 1994 (Tabasco Governor race).
It had also defeated Calderon's NAP party in rigged races too.
The PRI was supplanted by Vicente Fox who
appears to have cleaned up Mexican corruption to a considerable extent and set
up what appears to be a highly professional and independent election agency, the IFE.
Madrazo was actually running for an unusual and interesting alliance of the PRI
with the
Mexican Green Ecologist Party (PVEM) and focused on water issues.
</p>
<p>
So the question &ndash; if we want to talk about who "should" have won &ndash;
hinges
on who the Madrazo PRI voters would have preferred: Obrador or Calderon?
</p>
<p>
That is unclear to everybody, far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
But there is another hypothesis, which is that many leftists would have preferred Madrazo
as the "lesser evil" versus the rightist Calderon, and similarly many Calderon voters
would have preferred Madrazo over Obrador.    In that case, quite possibly
<i>Madrazo</i> was the "Condorcet winner," i.e. would have beaten every other candidate
in a head-to-head contest.
<p>
So all in all, I conclude this election <i>probably</i> was an example of either the
"spoiler" phenomenon (a fate warned about in 
both 
<a href="Mexico06Spoil2.html">this</a>
and
<a href="Mexico06Spoil.html">this other</a>
newspaper article) &ndash;
or the "eliminated Condorcet winner" phenomenon,
and in either case Calderon was the "wrong winner."
Whether or not that was true, almost certainly 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> would have
produced a far more clearly fair election result.
I also think <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>,
<a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>,
and plurality with separate top-2 runoff
both would have handled it better
than the plain plurality system that was used. 
And there is <a href="PsEl04.html">no doubt</a>
Mercado's 4% total was vastly smaller (due
to plurality distortions) than what it would have been under range voting;
it probably would have been in the same ballpark as Calderon and Obrador.
</p>
<p>
(<small>This election also may have been swung by election manipulation and fraud:
<a href="ObradorProtest.html">Obrador claims</a> there were numerous statistical "anomalies" and 
<a href="StealingMexico.html">suspicious signs</a> were noted by investigative reporter
Greg Palast in the <i>Guardian</i> &ndash; see also his
<a href="PalastM2.html">followup article</a> &ndash;
triggered by the Mexicans arresting
operatives of the notorious US contractors
ChoicePoint for stealing private voter databases... and here
<a href="http://rawstory.com/showoutarticle.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.narconews.com%2FIssue42%2Farticle1967.html">Narco News</a>, "reporting on the drug war and democracy from Latin America",
documents that fraud happened... and the IFE's computer systems were partly designed
by companies and partners of Calderon's brother-in-law Diego Hildebrando Zavala,
as contracts show... and the IFE had to admit that the PAN had "somehow"
gotten hold of private voter registration data [Jorge Herrera article in
<i>El Universal</I> 28 June 2006]...
Obrador sued alleging fraud, but the IFE, after conducting a very partial recount of
9% of the precincts, declared Calderon the victor.
As J.C.McKinley put it in his <i>NY Times</I> article page A4, 7 sept 2006:
"Obrador pointed out that <i>more than half</i> of the tally sheets from the nation's
130,000
election precincts contained errors in arithmetic, a sign of widespread
incompetence
among poll workers or of extra ballots magically appearing in some boxes and
disappearing from others [and rather worrying since even a single vote change per
precinct would have mathematically been enough to swing the election to Obrador].
But the seven-member electoral tribunal rejected that argument, chalking up the
irregularities
to human error, which they said had affected all parties, and so could not be
fraud. They
also denied [Obrador]'s request for a full recount based on the errors."
Obrador, outraged by the IFE's ruling, then declared he was going to set up
a <a href="MexShadow.html">shadow government</a>.</small>)
Judging 1%-margin elections can be difficult (and 0.01%-margin elections are well beyond
what present systems are capable of).  That difficulty is illustrated by the following facts:
<ul>
<li>
The IFE's preliminary count indicated that slightly over 2% of the votes cast were "invalid"
("votos nulos") due to overvoting or some other cause.
</li>
<li>
The final(?) Calderon-over-Obrador margin of 243,000 votes would be reversed by reversing
<i>one</i> vote per
polling place (130,000 polling places).
</li>
<li>
In the 2004 USA Bush v. Kerry presidential election,  one hour past
midnight on election night,
CNN's exit polls called the nationwide popular vote for <i>Kerry</i> by a &gt;2.5% margin
(based on 11027 respondents)
<i>but</i> the official results gave it to <i>Bush</i> by a 2.4% margin.
</li>
</ul>
