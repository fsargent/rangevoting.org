<H2> Pro-Extremist versus Pro-Centrist bias in Voting Methods </H2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith</small></p>
<p>
This page will try to present a concise explanation,
including "pretty pictures" (Yee diagrams) of why we claim:
</p>
<ul><li>
Instant Runoff (IRV), plain Plurality (and presumably also plurality plus separate top-two runoff)
are <i>biased</i> voting systems in the sense that, with honest voters,
these systems tend to favor <i>extremist</i> candidates.
</li><li>
Approval voting can be biased in the opposite direction &ndash; tending to 
favor <i>centrist</i> candidates.  This depends on how the voters behave.
Honest approval voters can "place their approval threshold" at different "quality levels."
For example, if there are 7 candidates named A,B,C,D,E,F,G and some voter
honestly regards A as the best and G as the worst in the order
A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;E&gt;F&gt;G, then
it would be "honest" for the voter to approve A and B,
which would happen if voter placed her "threshold" between B and C.
It also would be honest to approve A,B,C and D,
which would happen if voter placed her "threshold" between D and E.
Any prefix in the ordering is honest, but, for example, approving E but <i>not</i> A would be
a "dishonest" approval vote.  
Assuming all voters are honest, then with some strategies for choosing their approval threshold,
approval voting exhibits no centrist/extremist bias.  But with other threshold-choosing
strategies,
it exhibits pro-centrist bias.
</li><li>
Condorcet and Score voting both have little or no bias favoring either centrists or
extremists.
</li></ul>
<h3> Yee diagrams </h3>
<p>
Ka-Ping Yee in 2006 introduced a wonderful
way to examine single-winner election methods
via computer graphics.  
Versions 2.0 and above of my program <a href="IEVS/IEVS.c">IEVS</a>
(<i>I</i>nfinitely <i>E</i>xtendible <i>V</i>oting <i>S</i>imulator;
see <a href="IEVS/IEVSinputs.txt">example input</a>)
support generation of Yee-type pictures and the pictures in this directory were produced
by using IEVS.
</p><p>
To explain how Yee pictures work: imagine the N "candidates" are N fixed
points in the Euclidean plane.
The voters also are points in that plane, but imagine they are random points
sampled from a 2-dimensional 
<a href="assets/images/gauss2.gif">Gaussian</a> distribution with prescribed variance and 
prescribed centerpoint (peak location) <i>(x,y)</i>.
Imagine these voters conduct an election to choose a winner.
Voters prefer candidates that are nearer to them ("utility is a decreasing function 
of voter-candidate distance").
We then <i>color</i> the pixel at <i>(x,y)</i> with the color of the <i>winner</i>
(selected from a fixed N-color palette).  Do this for every 
<i>(x,y)</i> and the result is a multicolored picture.
You get different pictures depending on the candidate-coordinates, the
voting method used, and the variance of the Gaussian.
</p>

<H3> Some simple symmetrical point sets (to introduce reader to concept) </H3>
<H3> First example: 3 candidates at the vertices of an equilateral triangle </H3>

<p>
All election methods ever seriously proposed  return the same Yee-picture (at left;
the candidate-locations are indicated by the little colored circles)
</p>
<img src="IEVS/vorEqTri.bmp" alt="vorEqTri.bmp">
<img src="IEVS/worstEqTri.bmp" alt="worstEqTri.bmp">
<p>
All those methods perform "optimally," i.e. elect the best winner for society always
in this scenario.  If they instead were to elect the <b>worst</b> winner,
we'd instead get the picture at right.
</p>

<H3> Second example: 4 candidates at the vertices of a square (the corners of the image) </H3>

<p>
<i>Almost</i> all election methods ever seriously proposed  return the same Yee-picture
(at left):
</p>
<img src="IEVS/vorSquare.bmp" alt="vorSquare.bmp">
<img src="IEVS/irvSquare.bmp" alt="irvSquare.bmp">
<img src="IEVS/irvPent5.bmp" alt="irvPent5.bmp">
<p>
which again represents optimal performance.
But not all: the <b>IRV</b> (instant runoff) method returns a rather different (and crazy)
picture (using for the voter-Gaussian's &sigma;=196 in each axis direction; the picture
is 200x200), at middle.
If we go to pentagonal rather than square symmetry (rightmost picture), 
then <b>IRV</b> behaves better  &ndash; it always elects the optimal winner in
the large #voters limit &ndash; but in some ways it behaves even more peculiarly:
here there is a <i>pentagonal ring</i> of "tough to call" elections in which IRV
(due to voter randomness) occasionally returns a suboptimal winner.  The <i>truly</i>
tough-call elections are near the center of the pentagon,
but that is not the way IRV perceives it.
</p>

<H3> Our workhorse: A set of 14 random points </H3>

<p>
The points are:
(120,126), (64,158), (102,114), (35,164), (66,161), (146,164), (153,59), (115,101), 
(136,112), (95,59), (117,37), (164,80), (31,153), (170,82).
The picture window is [0,199]&times;[0,199] with the origin in the lower left corner.
In all the pictures in this section the utility function is
1/&radic;(12000+Distance&sup2;) and the Gaussian has &sigma;=70 in each axis direction.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Unbiased voting methods</h3>
<p>
In the limit of a large number of voters, all of the following voting methods,
<ol>
<li>
The hypothetical <b>optimum</b> method (best societal utility winner), 
</li><li>
all "<b>Condorcet</b> methods" with honest voters
<blockquote>
The theorem that with honest voters distributed centrosymmetrically about
any given pixel, and utility a decreasing function of voter-candidate distance,
a Condorcet winner always exists and is the closest candidate to that pixel,
apparently was first proved by
[Otto A. Davis, Morris H. DeGroot, Melvin J. Hinich:
Social Preference Orderings and Majority Rule,
Econometrica 40,1 (Jan 1972) 147-157,
see thms 1 and 4 and corollary 2].
It also was mentioned by
[Richard D. McKelvey:
Intransitivities in multidimensional voting methods and
some implications for agenda control,
J.Economic Theory 12 (1976) 472-482.]
</blockquote>
</li><li>
<b>Approval</b> voting with "oblivious random threshold" (that is, each voter approves
candidates closer to them than R, where each voter independently chooses R
at random according
to some fixed everywhere-positive probability density on the positive reals),
</li><li>
<b>Approval</b> voting with the following kind of voter behavior:
(a) hold approval election, (b) hold another this time with voters approving
candidates above a utility threshold, disapproving those below, and toss a fair coin to
decide whether to approve anybody whose utility is
exactly equal to the threshhold &ndash; where each voter uses the utility of
the previous round's winner as her threshold, (c) keep re-doing approval elections
as in (b) until a steady state (same winner every time) is reached (which we can prove
will happen with probability&rarr;1)
</li></ol>
<p>
by <i>theorem</i>, will produce a Yee diagram exactly the same as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram"><i>Voronoi</i> diagram</a>
of the points (candidates).  That is: the region of the image-plane closest to candidate X, will
be the win-region for candidate X (hence colored X's color).  I.e. whenever the center of
the voter distribution lies closer to X than to any other candidate, then X will win.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Example Voronoi diagram:</b>
With candidates located at these 13 random points
(69,173), (152,133), (162,46), (27,164), (82,156), (170,30), (116,129), 
(49,85), (114,101), (72,41), (134,118), (106,111), (81,83), 
[and the utility function is
1/&radic;(12000+Distance&sup2;) and the Gaussian has &sigma;=70 in each direction]
the Voronoi diagram is  shown at left.
</blockquote>
<p>
It is a theorem that Voronoi regions always are convex polygons (in 3D, convex polyhedra)
containing the candidate of their color.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3> Score voting &ndash; not very biased in either direction </h3>

<img src="IEVS/range14.bmp" alt="range14.bmp" align="left">
<p>
For the 13 candidates in the Voronoi diagram above, 
<b>Score</b> voting (also called range voting)
using "normalized" scores &ndash; i.e. each voter rescales and translates
her candidate-utilities so
that the worst candidate (in her view) has minimum-allowed score and the best one has
maximum-allowed score &ndash;
yields a picture which is a slightly distorted version of the Voronoi diagram.
</p><p>
Evidently score voting's pro-extremist or pro-centrist bias (if any) is small.
If you inspect the picture very carefully, you should perceive a slight pro-centrist bias.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3> Approval as a Pro-Centrist voting method </h3>

<img src="IEVS/approval14.bmp" alt="approval14.bmp" align="left">

<p>
For the 13 candidates in the Voronoi diagram above, 
<b>Approval</b> voting &ndash;
assuming now that the voters use the mean candidate-utility as their
"approval threshold" &ndash;
does <i>not</i> yield
the Voronoi diagram.  As you can see,
it obliterates the win regions of many candidates &ndash; no matter where the center
of the Gaussian voter distribution, those candidates can never win.
It plainly seems to favor
centrists over extremists in the sense that the candidates with nonempty win-regions 
mostly are centrally located.  [You can tell which candidates 
by comparing the colors of those candidates (i.e. the colors inside those little circles which 
represent "candiates") with the colors of the win-regions.]
With this voter-behavior, approval has a large pro-centrist bias;
but as we saw previously, with certain other voter behaviors approval is unbiased.
Under <a href="AppCW.html">reasonable assumptions</a> about voter behavior, approval will
always elect <i>Condorcet winners</i>, and in that case the Voronoi diagram is generated exactly
and approval would be completely unbiased, and in our 2D scenarios optimum.
</p>
<br><br>


<h3> Extremist-favoring voting methods </h3>
<p>
Meanwhile, <b>IRV</b> (honest voters, lefthand picture below)
exhibits crazy behavior in which about half the candidates can <i>never win</i>,
many others do not lie within their own win-regions, the win regions can exhibit crazy shapes
(including severely-nonconvex, disconnected, and non-simply connected...), and
there are a lot of "close call" (random dot) regions representing 
election "near-tie nightmares."  
Incidentally, IRV supporters have told me they believed it was <i>rare</i> for
IRV to fail to elect a Condorcet winner (when one existed).  They're wrong: <i>every pixel</i>
in this picture where the IRV picture differs in color from the Voronoi pixel,
is a counterexample.
Observe that IRV gives "outsiders" or "extremists"
a large advantage over "centrists" &ndash; it is almost impossible 
for a centrist candidate to win with IRV in this picture, since all the centrist candidates have
no win-region (except perhaps the red candidate and then only by benefitting from
"random dottiness").
Basically only 8  out of the 14 candidates can win (have non-empty win-region in Yee diagram)
and all 8 are "extremists" i.e. non-centrally located.  The centrists all get "zeroed out"
and IRV never permits them to win.
This usually happens with nearly any set of 14 random points in the square; 
it is not a special characteristic
just for our  particular choice of 14 points.

</p><p><small>
[Note: if we tell our computer program 
IEVS to use more voters,
then the "randomness" in the pictures diminishes, but it costs a lot
more computer time.  In all these pictures, each pixel has <tt>TopYeeVoters=256</tt>
which, roughly, means that each pixel is based on votes from &asymp;2500 voters. I actually
prefer to use this parameter setting as opposed to trying much harder to take 
the number of voters to &infin;, because that way we can see the presence of
"near-tie election nightmares" corresponding to "random dottiness" easily in the picture.]:
</small></p>
<img src="IEVS/irv666.bmp" alt="irv666.bmp">
<img src="IEVS/plurality666.bmp" alt="plurality.bmp">
<p>
At right above is plain <b>plurality</b> voting, which is the least expressive 
common voting method
(voters can only indicate their top choice).
Observe that it obliterates all
the centrist candidates down to zero-win-regions (and the light-blue candidate is
not in its own win-region).    Only 7 of the 14 candidates can win and 
every one is an "extremist."
</p>

<h3> A few voting methods with low Bayesian Regret </h3>
<p>
Below are the four voting methods that (with range voting) were the best according
to IEVS's <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian regret</a>
measurements. From left to right, 
<b>Range+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Approval(mean-based threshold)+top2-runoff</b>, 
<b>Brian Olson's IRNR system</b>,
and <b>Chris Benham's MCA system.</b>
(Some of these don't look too good, so how can these methods be the "best"? Well,
IEVS also takes account of a vast number of non-geometric scenarios.  Just because methods
do not perform terribly well in these Yee-type 2D geometric scenarios, does not
necessarily prevent good performance in others.)
Notice how the top-2-runoff between the top two range voting finishers tends
to help correct for distortions caused by "normalization" effects in plain range voting.
(It also tends to fix problems caused by "strategic voting," since even strategic voters
will vote honestly in the runoff round, but
that is not an issue here since these
pictures involve honest voters.)  Thus the range+top2runoff picture (left below) does 
look quite good, i.e. greatly resembles the optimum-winner (Voronoi diagram) picture.
IRNR looks worse (e.g. several winners not in their own win-regions, some weird shapes)  
but still not too bad,
albeit MCA and Approval+top2-runoff look pretty bad.
