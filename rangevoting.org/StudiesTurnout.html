Competitiveness and turnout
</H2>

<blockquote>
"A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls."
&ndash; U.S. Vice President J. Danforth Quayle
</blockquote>

<p>
Competiveness and the feeling (justified by recent history) that
your side has a decent chance to win, <b>increase turnout;</b>
this fact is supported by all 7 of the following studies:

The impact of closeness on turnout: An empirical relation based on a
study of a two-round ballot,
PUBLIC CHOICE 127, 3-4 (Jun 2006) 469-491<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Several methodological difficulties emerge from the
empirical evaluation of the impact of closeness on turnout. The most
critical resides in the use of the actual electoral results to
assess the impact of closeness. Important doubt therefore remains
with respect to the empirical validity of the relationship between
turnout and closeness. This article intends to explore this
ambiguity by an econometric analysis of the two-round French
legislative elections. The first ballot gives excellent information
to the voters on the expected closeness of the upcoming second
ballot. The results show that closeness, whatever its measure, has
an important and meaningful impact on electoral participation.
