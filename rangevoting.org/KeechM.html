<H2> Keech & Matthews on the Republican 1964 primary &ndash; failure of plurality voting </H2>

<p>
William R. Keech (later a professor of political science at UNC Chapel Hill and later
Carnegie Mellon University)
<!-- Carnegie Mellon University -->
gave a presentation at the 1972 APSA (Amer. Polit. Sci. Assoc.) meeting
arguing that the Republican 1964 presidential nominee "should" have been
William Scranton, who was preferred pairwise over the actual nominee Barry Goldwater
by a massive margin.  I was unable to track this work down, but
Keech &amp; Matthews  discussed the matter in their later book
</p>

<blockquote>
William R. Keech &amp; Donald R. Matthews: The Party's Choice, Brookings Institution,
Washington DC 1977 with an epilogue concerning the 1976 nominations.
(Also available electronically for money through the
<a href="http://www.questia.com/library/book/the-partys-choice-by-william-r-keech-donald-r-matthews.jsp">Questia online library</a>.)
</blockquote>

<p>
This book is a study of 10 presidential nomination decisions since 1936 (20 in all,
since 2 parties).  It, needless to say, has a low opinion of the parties' nomination processes,
noting on page 114:
</p>

<blockquote>
The record of the presidential primary system as it has operated in the 
opposition party since 1936
can thus be summed up as follows: When the party has a single front-runner, the primaries 
rarely change the situation. 
When the competitive situation within the party is more 
confused (1940, 1948,  1952, 1964), the primary system does little to facilitate the 
emergence of a single leader.
</blockquote>

<p>
Anyhow, let's return to our main topic, 
the Republicans' disastrous decision to nominate Barry Goldwater in 1964, leading 
to, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1964">Wikipedia</a> 
called it,
"one of the most lopsided presidential elections in United States history...
Johnson crushed Goldwater in the general election, winning 61.1
percent of the popular vote, the largest percentage 
since the popular vote first became 
widespread in 1824 (up to the time of writing, 2006)"
or as the <i>New York Times</i> 4 Nov. 1964 
banner headline read, "JOHNSON SWAMPS GOLDWATER."
</p>

<p>
When your party loses to the largest popular vote ever recorded, it behooves you
to ask: <i>why?</i>
Well, according to Keech &amp; Matthews p143-144:
</p>

<blockquote>
As the Pennsylvania Governor [Scranton] frantically barnstormed the country, the 
Gallup polls showed that President Johnson was ahead of
Goldwater by a 78 percent to 14 percent margin. 
The first choice preferences of Republican voters 
for their party's nominee were a stand-off between Goldwater (22 percent),
Nixon (22 percent), Scranton (20 percent), and Lodge (21 percent), 
though if the race were narrowed to a two-way choice between 
Goldwater and Scranton, the Pennsylvania Governor came out comfortably ahead, 
55 percent to 34 percent.
</blockquote>

<p>
[Independent <a href="assets/documents/GallupPolls1964.txt">fact check</a> by me:
Seven Goldwater-versus-Johnson "trial heat" Gallup polls held between 1 January and
2 November found Johnson's lead over Goldwater ranging between 77-to-18 and 64-to-29 percent 
with the rest undecided.  Those are huge leads but not as large as 78-to-14 as claimed
by Keech &amp; Matthews.  Another nationwide
Gallup poll on 12 July forcing a Goldwater-v-Scranton choice
(only Republicans polled) found they preferred Scranton 60-to-34 with the rest undecided.]
</p><p>
Keech and Matthews
also noted on page 142, concerning the primary in the largest state (California):
</p>

<blockquote>
The chances for a Rockefeller victory in California seemed good.
Polls taken after the Oregon primary [15 May] showed the
first-choice preferences of the state's Republicans were almost evenly split
between Rockefeller (26%), Lodge (24%), Goldwater (21%), and Nixon (21%).
But given a <i>forced choice</i> between Rockefeller and
Goldwater, [Rockefeller] came out well ahead...
on June 2... Barry Goldwater won with 51.2% of the vote.
</blockquote>


<p>
[Independent fact check by me:
Two nationwide 
Gallup polls on 19 Feb. and 20 March forcing a Rockefeller-v-Goldwater choice
found they preferred Rockefeller by 49-to-36 percent
on the earlier and by 45-to-44 on the later date (rest undecided);
but if only Republicans were polled, they preferred Goldwater 44-to-41.]
</p><p>

<p>
Different contest; same theme:  plurality-system distortions caused by
vote-splitting or strategic focusing by the voters on perceived "front runners"
(at the time, nationally speaking, Goldwater was perceived to be one of the front runners
despite his initial lack of popularity in California)
caused somebody to win whom
it is known would have been beaten head-to-head by at least
one opponent.
</p>

<p>
According to the second-hand report on Keech's 1972 presentation
on page 531 of volume 9 issue 4 of <i>Polity</i>, year 1977
(unfortunately I never saw the <i>primary</i> source),
Keech there went further, arguing that
William Scranton was the <a href="Glossary.html">Condorcet winner</a>, and
would have beat Goldwater pairwise by an even huger 60-to-34% margin.
</p>

<p>
Being the Condorcet winner is fine and dandy and means many a voting system would have
nominated Scranton (e.g. see <a href="AppCW.html">this</a> for why range voting
probably would have) &ndash; 
<i>but</i> not the system actually used, 
the <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> system, which nominated Goldwater 
to set the stage
for the worst presidential defeat ever.  
The problem was that the anti-Goldwater Republicans
split their vote between Lodge, Rockefeller, and Scranton.
</p>

<p>
Scranton would have done better than Goldwater versus Johnson (although
Johnson would have defeated either).
To support that, we offer (in addition to the seven Goldwater-vs-Johnson
polls we cited before)
these year-1964 Gallup polls.
A nationwide Gallup poll on 
1 July posed a forced choice between Scranton and Johnson; results were
Johnson=69%, Scranton=26%, undecided=5%.   On the same day, a simultaneous poll question
forcing a Johnson-v-Goldwater
choice went 77-18-5.
In a 19 June poll,
Gallup asked US Democrat-party county chairs which Republican they thought would
have the best chance to beat Johnson.   Scranton was the top choice
with 303 votes (Goldwater got 297).
Finally,
<i>Republicans only</i>
were asked on 22 January, if it were Johnson versus Goldwater, who would they
elect?  The results were Johnson=41%, Goldwater=47%, rest undecided.
This shows how incredibly narrow Goldwater's support was; he likely could not have beaten
Johnson even if <i>democrats were not allowed to vote</i>!!
(Based on the fact that
according to a 9 Feb. gallup poll,
party affiliations were Dem=49%, Repub=27%, Independent=24%.)
</p>


<p>
So we ask the Republican Party this: 
Do you <i>like</i> getting killed?
If not, we suggest <i>learning</i> from this mistake and adopting range voting for your
next presidential primary.  As Santayana once said,
"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
