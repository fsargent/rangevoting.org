<H1> The Frome Australia IRV by-election of 17 January 2009 </H1>
<H2> Demonstrates some IRV election pathologies such as "non-monotonicity" </h2>

The election was triggered by the resignation of former Premier and state Liberal MHA Rob Kerin.
(The seat had been retained by the Liberals in the 2006 state election by a 3.4%
margin, and in the 2002 election by 11.5%.
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frome_state_by-election,_2009">Wikipedia</a> page on this election.
Note Frome is a constituency of <i>South</I> Australia, i.e. not a <i>federal</i> house seat
for <i>full</i> Australia, which is a point the original version of this wikipedia article
confused its readers, i.e. me, about.)
Instant Runoff Voting (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>) 
was employed, as is usual in Australian House elections.

 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow"><caption>
<b>Top-preference counts:</b>

<tr><th><u><u>Candidate</u></th><th><u>Votes</u></th><th><u>Other comments</u></th></tr>
<tr><td>
  Terry <b>Boylan</b> (Liber)    </td><td>7576    </td><td>Police officer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
  John Rohde (Labor)      </td><td>5041   </td><td> Postal worker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
  Geoff Brock (Indpt)     </td><td>4557  </td><td>  Mayor of Port Pirie.  
<!--Supported by Independent Senator Nick Xenophon.-->
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
  Neville Wilson (NatSA)  </td><td>1267  </td><td>  Deputy Mayor of Port Pirie Regional Council.</td></tr>

<tr><td>
  Peter Fitzpatrick(OneNat)   </td><td>134  </td><td>  Small business contractor.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
By the <b>4th IRV round</b> it was reduced to 3 candidates:
</p>
 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th><u><u>Candidate</u></th><th><u>Votes</u></th></tr>
<tr><td>  <b>Boylan</b> (Liber) </td><td>8215</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Rohde (Labor)  </td><td>5532</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Brock (Indpt)  </td><td>5562</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
whereupon Rohde was eliminated and <b>Brock</b> won the seat in
the <b>5th and final IRV round</b> [which is the "2CP" (two candidate preferred) vote
in the terminology of the Australian Election Commission (AEC)]:
</p>
 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th><u><u>Candidate</u></th><th><u>Votes</u></th></tr>
<tr><td>  <b>Brock</b> (Indpt)  </td><td>9987</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Boylan (Liber) </td><td>9322</td></tr>
</table>

<h3> An extra chunk of data</h3>

<p>
In Australian elections, the AEC usually refuses to provide 
enough data to enable anybody to reconstruct the
ballots or to prove the existence of various IRV election phenomena.
<i>However</i>, in this particular election, the data the AEC published was
enough to provide 100% certainty that 
this election was <a href="Monotone.html">non-monotone</a>.
The key extra sliver of AEC data was the "two party preferred" pairwise vote
</p>
 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th><u><u>Candidate</u></th><th><u>Votes</u></th></tr>
<tr><td>  <b>Boylan</b> (Liber) </td><td>9976</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Rohde (Labor)  </td><td>9333</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
telling us how many IRV voters ranked Boylan above Rohde (or the reverse),
ignoring the other 4 candidates.
</p>

<h3> <a href="Monotone.html">Non-monotonicity</a> </h3>
<p>
If X 
</p><center>
... &gt; Boylan &gt; ... &gt; Rohde &gt; ... &gt; Brock &gt; ...
</center><p>
voters (for any X with 31&le;X&le;321) had demoted Boylan to anywhere below Rohde
(most simply, all the way to last place):
</p><center>
... &gt; Rohde &gt; ... &gt; Brock &gt; ... &gt; Boylan
</center><p>
then it would have been Brock who was eliminated.
Then  <b>Boylan</b>
would have won in the final round, which would have been
</p>
 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th><u><u>Candidate</u></th><th><u>Votes</u></th></tr>
<tr><td>  <b>Boylan</b> (Liber) </td><td>9976-X</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Rohde (Labor)  </td><td>9333+X</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In other words: <i>Boylan would have won if he got fewer votes. Unfortunately
for him, he got too many votes, and therefore lost.  
</i></p>
To say that again:
<i>Voters who honestly ranked Boylan
top, were strategically foolish.  If 31-to-321 of them had ranked him bottom, that
would have made Boylan win.</i>
</p><p>
That's the <a href="IrvParadoxProbabilities.html">paradox</a>
of non-monotonicity.  One of Instant Runoff Voting's flaws is
that it can exhibit non-monotonicity
(as this election shows).   The other main kind of non-monotonicity (there are two main types)
was exhibited in another
IRV election (held in the same year, 2009) to choose the Mayor of
<a href="Burlington.html">Burlington</a> Vermont, USA.  
</p>
 <table cellspacing="3" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr><th><u>Frome 2009:</u> Boylan loses since had too many votes</th>
<th><u>Burlington 2009:</u> Kiss wins because had too few votes</th></tr>
<tr><td>If 100 Boylan voters had dishonestly or strategically voted him as "worst,"
that would have made Boylan win (but as it was, Brock won because Boylan got too many votes).
</td><td>
If 800 Wright voters had dishonestly or strategically instead voted for Kiss,
that would have made Kiss lose (and Montroll win; as it was, Kiss won because
he got too few votes).
</td><tr></table>

<h3> A no-show paradox </h3>
<p>
If 200 new
&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Rohde&gt;...&gt;Boylan 
&nbsp;&nbsp;
voters had magically appeared...  that would have made 
Boylan win.   So those voters were very wise not to vote.
</p>

<h3> Other paradoxes? </h3>
<p>
There may have been other paradoxes too, but because the AEC only provided <i>partial</i>
election data, I cannot tell.
