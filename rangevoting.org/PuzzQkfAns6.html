Puzzle #6: Probabilities of dice comparisons
</H2>

<p>
<b>
Puzzle:
</b>
Suppose there are 4 dice: Blue, Green, Red, and White.
These dice have different numbers than usual printed on their faces.
After observing a long sequence of experiments rolling pairs of these dice,
you conclude that
<ul>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the blue die gives a higher number than the green die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the green die gives a higher number than the red die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
<li>
When both are rolled simultaneously, the red die gives a higher number than the white die
2/3 of the time.
</li>
</ul>
You are now asked to consider rolling the blue and white dice simultaneously.
What can you conclude about the probability P that the blue die will
produce a higher value than the white one?  (Is P>50%?)
</p>

<p>
<b>
Answer:
</b>
We <i>cannot</i> conclude P>50%.
In fact, P can be as small as 1/3 (i.e. 33.33%) and as large as 100%!
A set of dice that yield a Blue>Green>Red>White>Blue "probability cycle"
(where "A>B" means "rolling A will produce a higher roll than B with probability 2/3")
is given in the <i>top</i> row of this table.
</p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<caption>
How to construct dice.
</caption>
<tr> 
<th bgcolor="aqua">blue</th>
<th bgcolor="green">green</t>
<th bgcolor="red">red</th>
<th bgcolor="white">white</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td bgcolor="aqua">004444</td>
<td bgcolor="green">333333</td>
<td bgcolor="red">222266</td>
<td bgcolor="white">111555</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td bgcolor="aqua">446666</td>
<td bgcolor="green">555555</td>
<td bgcolor="red">222266</td>
<td bgcolor="white">111333</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
However, if the numbers painted on each die's 6 faces instead are those given
in the <i>bottom</i> row of the table, then Blue>Green>Red>White
and the Blue die will beat the White die 100% of the time.
</p>

<p>
The fact that 1/3 and 100% both are best possible bounds is obvious for 100%,
and not-so-obvious for 1/3 &ndash;  but proven by
S.Trybula: On the paradox of N real variables, Zastos. Matem. (Applied) 8 (1965) 143-154
and also independently by Z.Usiskin: Max-min probabilities in voting paradoxes, 
Annals of Math'l Statistics 35,2 (1964) 857-862.
Usiskin indeed showed that with 2K "dice" (i.e. independent probability distributions
over the reals), the maximin intransitivity probability P(2K)
was bounded by 
<nobr>(3K-1)/(4K)&le;P(2K)&le;3/4,</nobr> and 
<nobr>P(3)=(&radic;5-1)/2=0.61803...</nobr>
(recognize the "golden ratio"?) and 
P(4)=2/3.
</p>
<p>
The exact maximum possible intransitivity probabilities P(n) for n=2, n=3, and n=4 dice,
namely P(2)=1/2,
P(3)=(&radic;5-1)/2,
and P(4)=2/3, all meet the following upper bound claimed by
[Ilya I. Bogdanov: Intransitive Roulette,
Mathematical education, ser. 3, no. 14 (2010) 240-255;
this journal and this paper both are in Russian].
</p><center>
P(n) &le; 1 - (1/4) sec(&pi;/[n+2])<sup>2</sup> = 1 - 1/[2+2cos(2&pi;/[n+2])] &lt; 3/4.
</center><p>
Since my Russian is poor (actually, nonexistent)
I am not sure whether Bogdanov is claiming the "&le;" is
tight for all n.
