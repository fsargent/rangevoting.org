<H2> Answer to Puzzle #13: range-voting with outlier-discarding </H2>

<p><b>
Puzzle:
</b>
Suppose each voter's "vote" is an integer
numerical score from 0 to 99 for each candidate, for example a legal vote
in a 4-candidate election might be (99, 54, 0, 99).
Suppose the "final score" for a candidate is the average of all his scores that remain
after you discard the top X% and the bottom X% of them.
<small>
If X=50, this
is just the <i>median score</i>, and if X=0 then this is just the usual kind
of range voting. These are both important special cases.  But more generally
any fixed X with 0&le;X&le;50 can be considered.
</small>
One of the advantages of ordinary range voting, which appears to be sacrificed in this
more general kind of voting, is the fact that with range voting only a <i>small</i>
amount of information may be sent by each precinct to central tabulating, <i>summarizing</i>
all the ballots (no matter how many) in that precinct.  The entire set of
ballots need not be sent.
<ol type="a">
<li>
Show that this "appearance" is delusory &ndash; this more general kind of range voting
<i>still</i> has the small-amount-of-info-summary-can-be-sent property allowing
precincts to do their own "subtotals."
</li>
<li>
Why is this more-general kind of range voting (with X&gt;0)
far less democratic than ordinary range voting?
</li>
<li>
What bad phenomenon would often happen in practice were median-range-voting
(the X=50 special case) were adopted?  Hint: consider the
<a href="FrenchStudy.html">French Approval-Voting study</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Solution (a):</b>
for each candidate, send the 100 <i>counts</i> of 0-votes, 1-votes, 2-votes,... 99-votes,
for that candidate to central tabulating. 
This is 100C numbers worth of information, where C is the number of candidates,
<i>regardless</i> of the number of voters in the precincts (there could be a million voters and
we don't care), and it suffices.
</p>

<p>
<b>Solution (b):</b>
The main objection to "trimmed mean" range-voting variants
where you discard X% of the outliers then take the average (median-range is the
special case X=50, but one could also consider X=10, etc) is precisely that
this discarding happens. For example,
<center>
90% of the voters: Bush=0; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10% of the voters: Bush=100
</center>
is considered the same as
<center>
100% of the voters: Bush=0;
</center>
when it comes to rating Bush. 
That is (from the standpoint of democratic ideals) insane. 
It could easily cause all lesser-known
third-party candidates to get <i>zero</i>.
It just <i>discards</i> opinions of a minority
of society. 
That is very anti-democratic. 
It was enough to convince
me not to support any such variant.
</p>
<blockquote><b>Later note:</b>
<i>However</i>, Balinski &amp; Laraki (after this puzzle was written)
<a href="MedianVrange.html">advanced</a> a version of median-based range voting
with a crucial "tie breaking" second stage.  Their tie-breaking stage (when invoked)
causes that 10% not to be totally discarded... they still can have some effect.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Solution (c):</b>
Massive ties would often happen with highest-median-score voting.
In the <a href="FrenchStudy.html">French Approval-Voting study</a>
if voters gave <i>zero</i> scores to those they disapproved 
(or if they merely did so 80% of the time at random), then 
there would have been a 16-way tie
for first place with all contenders getting an exactly-equal median score value of zero.
