<H1> Majority Minority districts </H1>

<p>
I was disgusted to see in the Washington Post 
("Wonkblog" 2014-06-03) the myth yet again mindlessly repeated that
the Voting Rights Act <a href="VRAtext.html">(full text)</a> "requires the creation of 
majority-minority districts."
Further, it called that a "high minded" attempt to help said minorities.
</p><p>
Actually: 
There is not one word in the VRA that requires that.  
"Majority minority districts" are not even
<i>mentioned</i> in the VRA, much less "required"!
</p><p>
First of all, majority-minority districts usually <i>hurt</i>, not help, minorities.
by packing the Blacks into a single district, minimizing their voting effect.
</p><blockquote>
"Packing" and "cracking" are the two main ideas used by gerrymanderers to deprive you of
your vote.  Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcUDBgYodIE">4-minute video</a> 
about that.
</blockquote><p>
Indeed, the very same blog in the very same Washington Post (but at a different date,
2013-06-25) reported that "Political scientists Charles Cameron, 
Sharyn O'Halloran and David Epstein... found
that each additional majority-minority district increases the number of conservative-held 
seats by two" i.e. does hurt blacks (since Blacks as of year 2013 vote 90% Democrat, i.e.
<i>not</i> "conservative").
</p><p>
There is something to be said for having the author of this blog read earlier editions.
</p><p>
Majority-minority districts can also help minorities.  It depends on the situation.
It just appears to be the case, as of year 2013,
that on average they hurt them more than they help.
</p><p>
What about the supreme court?
</p><blockquote>
On 13 June 1996, the Supreme Court in redistricting cases from Texas and North Carolina 
ruled that four majority-minority districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. 
In its 5-4 decisions, the Court affirmed its earlier decisions in redistricting cases 
that strict scrutiny is triggered [as in Shaw v. Reno (Shaw I)] when the shape of the
district is "so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an 
effort to segregate the races without regard for traditional redistricting principles" or 
(as in Miller v. Johnson) when race is the "dominant and controlling rationale subordinating 
traditional race-neutral principles." Applying the standard of strict scrutiny in these 
Texas and North Carolina cases, the Court found that the districts were not narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest and thus violated the Equal Protection 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
</blockquote><p>
That was the opening paragraph of the description of
Bush v. Vera (case number 94-805)  in the Spring/Summer 1998 <i>Civil Rights Monitor</i>
which also mentions previous cases e.g. Miller v. Johnson 1995, which also had thrown 
majority-minority districts in the garbage.
</p>
<p>
Evidently, the supreme court failed to appreciate the Washington Post's claim that 
majority-minority districts were "required."  On the contrary, in these cases it 
thought they were "illegal."  And furthermore, the very <i>idea</i> of intentionally creating
majority-minority districts with racialness as the "dominant purpose" was ruled out
by the Supreme Court.  Which is exactly the opposite of what
the Washington Post 2014 wonkblog had implied.
