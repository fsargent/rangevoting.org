<H2> More explanation of Duverger-law graphical data </H2>

<p>
The picture 
<a href="duvpict.png">(png)</a>
<a href="duvpict.jpg">(jpg)</a>
is based on data covering the years 1981-1985 from table 8.1 in
Rein Taagepera &amp; Matthew S. Shugart:
<i>Seats and votes: the effects and determinants of electoral
systems</i>, Yale University Press,  1989.
However, we have added 2002-2005 data from
<a href="http://www.electionworld.org">ElectionWorld.org</a>,
namely:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Plurality:</b>
UK may 2005, US Nov 2004, 
India april-may 2004 (lumping all the LF, INC, and NDA parties into these three lumps),
Canada june 2004.
</li>
<li>
<b>Proportional Representation:</b>
S.Korea april 2004, Switzerland oct 2003, Iceland may 2003,
Finland march 2003,  Belgium may 2003
</li>
<li>
<b>IRV:</b> 
Australia oct 2004 (two different ENPP figures depending if count NPA, LPA as "distinct")
</li>

<p>
All data lower houses only.  The <i>vertical line</i> represents exactly two equal-seats parties
and as you can see almost all the plurality (green) datapoints lie to its left,
representing 2-party domination.
If another vertical were to be drawn at ENPP<sub>seats</sub>=1, that would represent
single-party domination, i.e. "tyranny."  As you can see, several plurality
countries are edging dangerously close to that imaginary line.
The <i>lower diagonal</i> line is the line of perfect proportional representation.
Most countries lie above that line indicating a departure from proportionality due to
minorities being squeezed out of
power.  
(Note: number of parties based on <i>seats</i> is what counts. 
The amount by which the ENPPs based on <i>votes</i> is larger, merely is a measure of
voter <i>futility</i>.)
The upper
diagonal line is a better fit to reality and represents exactly "one party
effectively vanishing."
</p>

<p>
The "effective number of political parties" (ENPP) is the reciprocal of the sum of the
squares of the seat (or vote) fractions got by the parties.
</p>

<H3> More detailed look &ndash; are there some exceptions? </H3>
There are a few interesting <i>exceptions</i> to the usual trends visible in this data.
First of all, <i>Canada</i> and <i>India</i>
seem to be plurality countries with more than two parties,
i.e. "exceptions" to Duverger's law.  Their 2004 datapoints are the two furthest-right
green points.
I believe in India that is because
there is a lot of religious, geographic, and linguistic segregation, allowing
many parties to exist &ndash; plus Indian democracy has only been operating for 60 years,
temporarily interrupted by
a massively undemocratic interval under Indira Gandhi &ndash; which may
not have been enough time for 2-party control to set in.
Also, although  Canada may seem to have 3 parties from its 2004 ENPP datum,
in fact it plainly seems historically to be dominated by
the Liberal and Conservative parties,
with only two occasions since 1867 (namely the Progressives
in 1921 and the New Democrats in 2011)
in which a third party got more seats than the minimum among the top two.
</p>

<p>
Second, South Africa seems in 2004 to be &ndash; remarkably for a PR country &ndash;
under (&lt;2)-party control &ndash; it is the left-bottom-most blue
data point at (1.97, 1.97).
In the 1980s, the S.Africa data point was the other most-left-bottom point.
Both seem to be invading the green plurality country regime and far from their home
blue PR regime.
At least at present that is because S.Africa
let the blacks have power in the early 1990s
and their party the ANC then quickly dwarfed all the others.  
(Really there is the ANC and a lot of small white-dominated parties, 
a combination which the ENPP formula
views as "1.97 effective" parties.)
Ultimately I predict (or hope) that race will cease to be such a giant feature
in South African politics, at which point the ANC probably will split up
into many parties.
</p>

<p>
For a somewhat more sophisticated look at "exceptions" to Duverger's law,
see W.H.Riker: Number of political parties, re-examination of Duverger's law, 
<i>Comparative Politics</i> 9,1 (1976) 93-106
where he argues that really, Duverger should be rephrased to say that 
<i>once 2-party domination locks in</i> it stays that way, but various random 
effects and transitions may need to happen 
before the lock-in occurs.  (He explains and has a model.)  
With this revised wording/model, Riker doesn't
know of any exceptions anymore.
