<p><i> New York Post</i> By JIM HINCH, 18 October, 2005 </p>

<p>Is that the sound of Clarence Norman singing?</p>

<P> Prosecutors believe that several Brooklyn judges were induced by Norman to funnel tens of thousands of dollars into Democratic party coffers in exchange for their judgeships. They want Norman to explain how the money trail worked source said that during a five-year period...

Mr. Norman also faces trials on three other indictments alleging political corruption.</p>

<H2> Norman clams up in judgeship probe </H2>

<p> <i>Daily News (NY)</i> By NANCIE L. KATZ, 25 Oct. 2005 </p>

<p>
Dethroned Brooklyn Democratic boss Clarence Norman refused to talk to prosecutors yesterday about judgeships for sale - because he says he knows nothing about it.
"While the district attorney apparently prefers to continue to leak sensational and unverified rumors ... the fact is that Clarence Norman has never received any moneys for any reason from judicial candidates or sitting judges and therefore has no information to share," said Norman's attorney, Edward Rappaport.
</p>
<p>
Already facing up to four years in prison for illegally soliciting more than $10,000 from a lobbyist, Norman's decision means the former assemblyman will stand trial yet again. He has three more indictments to fight - one carrying a maximum of 15 years behind bars, if he is convicted.

"We are preparing to go to trial on Nov. 7," Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes' spokesman Jerry Schmetterer said...

<H2> Brooklyn Democratic Figure Enters 2nd Corruption Trial </H2> 
<p> <i>New York Times</I> By ANDY NEWMAN, 15 November 2005 (page B5) </p>

<p>
The second corruption trial of Clarence Norman Jr., the former Brooklyn Democratic Party chief and assemblyman, began yesterday with prosecutors and Mr. Norman's lawyer offering sharply differing interpretations of a $5,000 check. The check, written in 2001 by the political club Mr. Norman founded, was made out to Mr. Norman...
</p>

<p>
The trial is Mr. Norman's second within two months. He was convicted in September of accepting illegal campaign contributions and faces up to four years in prison at his sentencing later this month. He also awaits trial on yet two more felony corruption charges.</p>

<p>Mr. Norman, 54, makes an impressive quarry for prosecutors: he was, until his first conviction,
the deputy speaker of the State Assembly and the longtime leader of the largest county Democratic 
Party east of Chicago. But the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, 
has his eye on a bigger target: a judicial selection system he says is rotten to the core.
</p>

<p>The prosecution of Mr. Norman grew out of Mr. Hynes's investigation into claims that Democratic leaders in Brooklyn sold judgeship nominations for $50,000. 
While Mr. Hynes has yet to bring any cases of judgeships for sale, 
he did turn up enough evidence to indict Mr. Norman on a small raft of largely unrelated 
felony charges.</p>

<p>Mr. Hynes has said he hoped that with one trial lost and another staring him in the face, 
Mr. Norman might be moved to cooperate, but so far Mr. Norman has not blinked.
