<p>
The USA (8 Nov. 2016) presidential election was won by Donald J. 
<b>Trump</b> (Republican party).
This table shows the preliminary (as of 3 Dec; all figures are expected to change slightly
as further vote-counting occurs, and the electoral college will meet on 19 Dec.) 
official election results.
</p><p>
<!--
<b>NEED TO UPDATE THIS SECTION:</b>
1 Dec. Over 2.5 million.
Nov. 28: 
Trump 46.5% votes=62,352,375
clinton 48.1% votes=64,429,062
says CNN, for lead=2.08 million.
Cook later same day says lead is 2.2 million, still rising.
Nov. 26:
64,156,255 to 62,238,425 says CNN, note contradiction with Clinton yesterday.
Nov. 25:
According to Cook Report, Clinton's ballot count is now at 64,225,863
compared with Trump's 62,210,612, lead of 2.015 million.
Nov. 23: Clinton ahead by 1.7 million popular votes
and still rising.
Nov. 18: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/election/results/president">CNN</a>
says HRC is the popular vote winner with 62115634
ahead of Trump's 61003417 by 1112217.
Nov. 13: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/2016-election-results/">AP</a>'s
popular vote count as of 13 November 2016, gives
Hillary Clinton 60981118 votes to Donald Trump's 60350241.
(Meanwhile, Gary Johnson got 4164589 and Jill Stein 1255968.)
Still uncalled by the AP:
Michigan (although Trump has a slight lead there)
and New Hampshire (Clinton leads there, maybe now called for her).
It is
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/clintons-popular-vote-lead-will-grow-and-grow/507455/">expected</a> 
that eventually 6-7 million more votes
will be counted for all candidates combined, and that Clinton's popular vote
lead will continue to grow, perhaps to as much as 
2 million, because she apparently is beating Trump by about a 2:1 ratio in
the late-counted categories of votes (especially absentee ballots
in California and Washington).

<b>*Update:</b>
Actually due to "faithless electors" who
voted for Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, Colin Powell,
Ron Paul, and Faith Spotted Eagle,
<i>neither</i> Trump nor Clinton
got the exact numbers of electoral votes tabulated
above (which they would have gotten with faithful
electors), getting 304 and 227 respectively.

The above table also shows, in the rightmost columns,

</p>

<a name="popev"><h3> Popular versus Electoral vote </h3></a>
<p>
In most other countries, there is only 
(what the USA calls) the "popular vote" &ndash;
they just call it the "vote."  
Under those rules Hillary <b>Clinton</b> 
would have won by about 2.9 million votes.
But in the USA, the candidates win individual states,
and then those states
contribute various integer numbers of electoral votes, then whoever
gets a majority of <i>those</i> wins.  Hence Trump won.
If nobody has a majority, the House
of Representatives decides the election.
</p><p>
If fewer than 50K votes had switched Trump&rarr;Clinton <i>in the crucial states</i>,
then she would have won, even if meanwhile tens of millions of votes
were switched Clinton&rarr;Trump in irrelevant states.
<!-- Clinton Trump margins:
MI: 11K
WI: 25
PA: 70
-->
</p><p>
Somewhat over 90% of the time, historically,
the popular and electoral winners have agreed,
but not in 2016.
The other candidates who won the USA popular vote but lost the 
election thanks
to the "electoral college" and/or House were:
Andrew Jackson in 1824, 
Samuel Tilden in 1876, 
Grover Cleveland in 1888,
and Al Gore in 2000.
</p><p>
It is worth briefly revisiting that historical roll to
point out a remarkable thing:
Donald Trump's was <b>by far the greatest ever popular vote loss</b>
by a presidential winner.
The table explains what we mean by that.
</p>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>Year</th><th>Candidate A</th>
<th>Candidate B</th>
<th>A-B pop. vote margin</th>
<th>B-A electoral vote margin</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>2016</td><td>H.R.Clinton</td><td>D.J.Trump</td>
<td>2.9 million=2.1%</td><td>306-232=74=13.75%</td></tr>
<tr><td>1876</td><td>S.J.Tilden</td><td>R.B.Hayes</td>
<td>252666=1.0%</td><td>185-184=1=0.27%</td></tr>

<tr><td>1888</td><td>Grover Cleveland</td><td>Benj.Harrison</td>
<td>94530=0.9%</td><td>233-168=65=16.2%</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In this table, "A" is the popular vote winner, while
"B" is the electoral vote winner (hence elected president).
The only election that approaches challenging the
supremacy of Trump-Clinton 2016, is Hayes-Tilden 1876
which was <i>fraudulent</i>!  The story of how that came about is
described in many history books, but let us merely quote 
</p>
<blockquote>
There is no longer any doubt that this election [1876] was "stolen."
&ndash; Samuel E. Morison, <i>The Oxford History of the
American People</i> (Oxford Univ. Press 1965) p.734.
</blockquote>
<p>
There is also one more election, 1824, that belongs on this list
as a special case.
Andrew Jackson won <i>both</i> the popular vote (to the
partial extent that the popular vote was even 
<i>counted</i> at that time; 6 states did not count it)
<i>and</i> the electoral vote, but still lost the Presidency to
J.Q.Adams due to the intercession of the House of Representatives.
This was the only time in US history that nobody got an electoral vote majority,
unless you count 1800 where Jefferson &amp; Burr were initially tied.
(Jackson could have clinched a win by getting 131 electoral votes,
but only got 99 hence this election was decided by the House.
Clay, who was Speaker of the House, threw his support to
Adams.  Crawford had suffered a paralyzing stroke 
that put him out of contention, and to the extent
he had an effect, he tended to 
split the House vote with Jackson.)
</p><pre>
     <u>Candidate</u>            <u>Pop.Vote</u>    <u>Electoral Vote</u>
    Andrew Jackson         <b>151271</b>         <b>99</b>
    John Quincy <b>Adams</b>      113122         84
    William H. Crawford     40856         41
    Henry Clay              47531         37
</pre><p>
Both the 1876 and 1824 elections
were regarded far and wide as travesties and had very thunderous
and damaging historical repercussions.  In particular, the price
the Republicans agreed to pay to get the Democrats to accede
to the corrupt inter-party 
bargain solidifying Hayes' fraudulent 1876 election
was basically to cease enforcing legal rights for blacks and to
open the floodgates to "Jim Crow" oppression over the next 90
or so years. 
</p><p>
Jackson regarded Clay&harr;Adams as having
made a "corrupt bargain" to undemocratically
deny him the presidency and also blamed
the death of his wife on slanders by his political opponents.
As a result when Jackson did become President 1829-1837
he had the attitude that anything he did to gain power, regardless of
the rest of the government, was OK.  He was a total slash-and-burn 
maniac, starting the so-called "spoils system"
whose corrupt tendencies took over the US government, to a 
too-large degree, from then on; and presiding
over the Cherokee "trail of tears" genocide in defiance of a Supreme Court
ruling.

Trump's <b>electoral college margin</b>
in 2016 ranked 46th-from-top (percentagewise)
out of the 58 USA presidential elections
according to
<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/trump-landslide-nope/">data</a> compiled by 
Prof. John Pitney,
while his popular vote loss
was by far the largest among all Presidents.  Trump described this as
</p>

<a name="hacked"><h3> Was Trump's victory fraudulent and the result of
"hacked" voting machines/computers in "swing states"? </h3></a>

<p>
As of the date of this writing (Nov. 2016)
I certainly do not know.  Some prominent computer security and voting
experts &ndash; e.g. J.Alex Halderman, Philip Stark, Ron 
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/18/election-audit-paper-machines-column/93803752/">Rivest</a>, 
and Barbara Simons
&ndash; claimed, due to circumstantial evidence, that this was
a likely-enough possibility that "forensic audits" ought
to be conducted in those states;
and urged the Clinton team to demand them.
Their evidence mainly consisted of 
</p><ol type="i"><li>
A claim that the parts of Wisconsin using "computerized
voting machines" gave Trump about 7% more votes.
<blockquote>

A <i>59% majority</i> of the vote-counting
machines in Michigan's most-Democratic area, 
namely 87 optical scanners, <i>broke</i> on election
day [Chad Livengood &amp; Joel Kurth:
<a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/05/recount-unrecountable/95007392/">Half of Detroit votes may be ineligible for recount</a>,
<i>The Detroit News</i> 6 Dec. 2016], causing 
392 of the 662 Detroit precincts to announce 
(what the state later admitted were)
incorrect ballot totals, i.e. with
the number of voters disagreeing with the number of votes.
Daniel Baxter, the elections director for the city of Detroit, 
blamed aging equipment and summed up the situation with "It's not good."
... Michigan then claimed it was <i>illegal</i> for 
those 392 precincts to be recounted!
</blockquote>
</li><li>
The fact many US
intelligence agencies had announced they believed Russia had tried
to influence the election by cyber methods, including
breaking into both the RNC and DNC computers and email systems,
and (separately) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta's emails,
which they then leaked to the public.
They also broke into voter registration databases in at least 
two states
(Illinois and Arizona) to steal voter data,
and tried to do so in at least 20 states.
This was according to several US intelligence
sources speaking to the press anonymously, as well as FBI director James Comey.
A large number of US intelligence agencies came to the "high confidence" conclusion
the actor behind this was Russia.  Then the CIA (and according to leaks
to the <i>Washington Post</i>
in mid-December, also later the FBI) further concluded this was directed by Putin
and/or the "highest levels of the Russian government" and with the <i>goal</i>
of electing Trump.  
Reuters (15 Dec 2016) then disclosed
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-hack-commission-idUSKBN1442VC">U.S. election agency breached by hackers after November vote</a> and the hacker was
Russian-speaking.
Incidentally, US intelligence as of 2016
believed Putin was the world's richest 
man ($85 billion) as a result of massive
"kleptocracy" of Russian state assets.  
(His official salary, in contrast,
was below $200K.)  There also seemed little doubt
Putin had had many of his opponents murdered.
</li><li>
The fact the pre-election polls seemed to be systematically more
pro-Clinton and anti-Trump than the official vote totals.
</li></ol><p>
Even Halderman said that he thought this evidence was weak &ndash; e.g.
he felt a priori it was more likely
there had been no hacking &ndash; <i>but</i> these experts 
felt that the net impact of this
evidence was great enough to justify auditing.
As 
<a href="https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba">Halderman</a>
put it:
"I don't believe that either one of these seemingly
unlikely explanations [hacked election or just
an innocent Trump-favoring fluctuation]
is <i>overwhelmingly</i> more likely than the other."
</p><p>
But despite whatever pleas these experts pled, Clinton refused to act.
</p><p>
Jill Stein, the Green party candidate, then announced 
that <i>she</i> was going to pay for recounts in Wisconsin,
Michigan, and Pennsylvania, (and perhaps Ohio?), and
raised over $4 million in 1 day to pay for it!
Her total fundraising effort was planned to be about $8 million.
(That 1-day fundraise was actually more money than she earlier had
raised to fund her entire presidential campaign.)
</p><p>
Donald Trump had some peculiar reactions to this.
First, he called Stein's recount effort a "scam" and "ridiculous,"
e.g. "This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has 
already been conceded, and the results of this election should be
respected instead of being challenged and abused" (25 Nov).
He indeed then filed at least one 
<a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/01/objection-presidential-recount-expected-filed-today/94730850/">objection</a>
and one
<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/332954119/Wisconsin-recount-complaint">lawsuit</a>
seeking to block it; and then Federal and Michigan State courts 
simultaneously
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-recount-idUSKBN13W04L">announced</a>
conflicting rulings that Michigan should and should not recount
(causing both sides to declare victory, and total confusion).
Second, on 27 Nov, Trump claimed that not only did he
win "the Electoral College in a landslide, I won
the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted
illegally."
He shortly thereafter added: 
"Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California 
&ndash; so why isn't the media reporting on this? 
Serious bias &ndash; big problem!"
</p><p>
My reactions to Trump's claims are mixed.
On the one hand, I feel we should take him seriously since he is 
the president-elect and has access to far more vote data 
and expertise than I.  Indeed he by now
must be one of the top few experts in the USA.
On the other hand, Trump provided zero evidence for these claims,
and note the documented <a href="#factdisaster">fact</a> that
70% of whatever Trump says that journalists check 
turns out to be "mostly false"
or worse, with over half being 4-Pinocchio lies.
</p><p>
And, oddly enough, as of 1 Dec. 2016,
there have been exactly
4 cases of voters casting fraudulent
votes in the 2016 election reported in the press
&ndash; and <i>all four were registered Republicans</i>:
</p><ol><li>
Terri Lynn Rote first early-voted Trump,
then voted again at a different polling site in
Des Moines Iowa. She was arrested on 27 Oct.
This was "the first time in 12 years that 
Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald 
can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud."
[Charly Haley: <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/10/28/voter-fraud-suspect-arrested-des-moines/92892042/">Voter
fraud suspect arrested in Des Moines</a>,
Des Moines Register 29 Oct 2016].
<!-- http://www.citypages.com/news/with-no-evidence-of-voter-fraud-terri-lynn-rote-decided-to-make-some/399238271 -->
Rote told Iowa Public Radio that she did it because
she was afraid her first ballot for Trump would be changed to
Hillary Clinton, because "the polls are rigged."
She could be imprisoned for up to 5 years.
</li><li>
Phillip Cook was arrested
on Election Day after voting twice in
Sugar Land, Texas.
He claimed to be an employee of Trump's campaign who 
was "testing the security of the electoral system."
But the Trump campaign denied that.
</li><li>
Audrey Cook was a Republican <i>election judge</i> in
Alton Illinois, who was charged on 4 Nov. with double voting.
She told the Associated Press 
she'd filled out absentee ballots for both herself and her dead
husband Vic
because she knew he would want Donald Trump to be president. 
[<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/alton-election-judge-charged-for-allegedly-casting-ballot-for-dead/article_036d82d7-80c4-57d3-9aa4-2cf02958e3ce.html">Alton
election judge charged for allegedly casting ballot for dead husband</a>,
Associated Press, 4 Nov 2016].
</li><li>
Gladys Coego was hired to open absentee ballots in Miami-Dade County. 
One of her co-workers noticed that she was going a step further, 
filling in the bubble for mayoral candidate
Raquel Regalado (R) with a pen she 
had in her purse. She was caught in the act and arrested.
[Patricia Mazzei:
<a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article111029767.html">Two
women busted for election fraud in Miami-Dade</a>,
Miami Herald 28 Oct. 2016].
</li></ol>
<p>
In any event, as of the present writing, neither Stein nor Clinton
has made any claim that the election was fraudulent or hacked.
But Trump did.  Indeed, for Trump's claim to be correct,
there must have been at least about 4.5 million illegal voters, if they
voted 80:20 for Clinton over Trump.  
If all were caught and imprisoned, that would more
than double the USA's prison population, and exceed the number of
illegal-voting convictions in all previous US history, combined, 
by a factor of order 1000.
</p><p>
So to summarize: 
(i) Stein has called for a recount, 
(ii) prominent computer scientists
and fraud experts have called for a forensic audit, 
(iii) Clinton has agreed to provide support
to help Stein's effort, and 
(iv) Trump has denounced the official election results as 
enormously fraudulent.
So there would seem to be unanimous agreement recounts
and forensic audits are somewhere between "good ideas" and "absolutely necessary."
Unfortunately I have doubts Stein will be able to cause a genuine forensic audit,
as opposed to a mere garden variety recount.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Update mid-December 2016:</b>
Stein succeeded in causing a recount in Wisconsin, which changed its totals
by less than 1000 votes (e.g. its Trump-Clinton margin widened by 162)
and did not appear to have any "forensic" component.
Her attempts to recount Pennsylvania or to have experts examine its
voting machines for "hacks" both were blocked.
In Michigan, the closest state, Trump supposedly beat Clinton by
10704 votes out of 4.8 million cast. A recount began but was aborted
by court order.  But 75335 votes were cast <i>but never counted</i>
by Michigan's 
optical-scan machines.  Many of these votes could have been counted
by humans, e.g.  because they had been filled out in red ink
unreadable by the machines, or using "X" marks or
&#9745; symbols instead of filled-in-circles. And Stein provided the
money to do it.  But they remained uncounted by order of courts
and/or Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.
Most of these uncounted votes occurred in Detroit
and Flint, two Clinton strongholds.
Also note, any precinct where the number of ballots differed from
the number of voters 
(e.g. 392 of the 662 Detroit precincts!)
was <i>forbidden</i> to recount, and
any precinct where seals on voting machines were broken, ditto.
This is the exact opposite of what any "forensic audit" would do,
and a dream come true for any fraudster.
</blockquote>
<p>
In any case,
<i>for the purposes of the rest of this page</i>,
we are going to take the attitude
that the election results were legitimate.
(And if the result really were fraudulent due to
fairly small alterations in "swing states,"
that would not affect the validity
of almost all we shall say.)

<p>
The CoPD is an inherently corrupt body since it
is a corporation created jointly by the Democratic and Republican
Parties, <i>not</i> an independent body owned by the media.
These two parties, <i>not</i>
the media or a public interest 
group such as the League of Women Voters, make the rules, 
and in particular
those rules always make sure that no third-party candidate is 
allowed to debate, unless both happen to want him to that year.
If any third-party candidate
shows up at the debate site, even with a legally purchased ticket,
the Republican and Democratic parties have so far, every time,
gotten armed 
thugs (oh sorry, I meant police) to escort him/her offsite
to block his/her attendance.
</p><p>
For example, after that happened to presidential candidate
Ralph Nader in 2000, he sued,
and the suit was settled in April 2002 with the CoPD paying him an 
"undisclosed amount of money" and issuing a hilarious
<a href="assets/documents/CopdNaderApology.txt">letter of apology</a> to him.
It explained that the CoPD had misunderstood Nader's intentions
and if they'd realized he merely intended to use his ticket to
attend (the way he said he would to the arresting officers)
they would have been happy to help in any way they could!
Why was it that no other
ticket-holding attendee of the debate was arrested, 
and no other had
their intentions misunderstood?  The letter did not say.
</p><p>
Did that experience cause the CoPD to cease these 
practices?
No.  In 2012, Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential
candidate, and her vice-presidential candidate Cheri Honkala,
were arrested by police 
as they attempted to enter the grounds of the
presidential debate site at Hofstra University, then
both were detained for eight hours handcuffed to chairs 
in a warehouse, guarded by 13 police,
with no phone call allowed, then finally
spirited away in a Secret Service car.
In 2016 essentially the same thing happened.
(Oddly enough, no charges were filed against Stein or Nader.
They were just arrested, not charged.)
</p><p>
Note that Clinton won all three debates by large margins, although 
Trump improved relative to her each time. (By 
extrapolating the improvements,  presumably Trump would have first won
a hypothetical 5th debate?)
</p><blockquote>
Trump described these as
"I won every poll [about the first] Presidential Debate &ndash;
except for the little watched @CNN poll" [tweeted 27 Sep.]
and he "Won every poll. Virtually every poll."
[told to his supporters later that same day];
and he also won 
"the second debate in a landslide (every poll)" [tweeted 11 Oct.]
and finally Trump told Bill O'Reilly on Fox News (Oct.27)  that he had
"won the third debate easily" and all the online polls 
had him winning, but then "dirty polls" came out showing him 
"losing by numbers that were ridiculous" which was since
pollsters are engaged in "suppression" and "tremendous dishonesty."
</blockquote><p>
In addition to the debates we just tabulated, 
there also were 12
debates between the Republican primary contenders
only, and 9 between the Democrats only.
</p><p>
The 9 Democratic debates were watched by an estimated
4.5 to 15.8 million viewers each, averaging 8M.
<!-- (158+85+78+102+45+80+55+59+56)/9 = 79.77 -->
The 12 Republican debates had 11 to 24 million viewers
each, averaging 15.5M. 
<!-- (24+23+14+13.5+18+11.1+12.5+13.2+13.5+14.5+16.9+11.9)/12=15.51 -->
Impressively, even the <i>least-watched</i>
Republican debate got more viewers than
8 among the 9 Democratic debates!
This was despite the facts that in 2016 more
Amercians identified as Democrats than Republicans
(Dem=35%, Rep=28% according to Pew;
Dem=29%, Rep=26% according to Gallup)
and the Democrats had fewer debates, both of which would
naively be expected to get them <i>more</i> viewers.
</p><p>
Why this viewership discrepancy?  
The Democratic debate schedule appeared to have
been chosen either by somebody tremendously
more idiotic than whoever scheduled the 
Republican debates &ndash;
or actually
with the <i>intent</i> of causing low viewership.
It was widely speculated that the latter was the case.
Why? The hypothesis was that
the DNC was <i>not</i> serving as an 
unbiased referee, but rather was biased 
pro-Clinton. And it was believed
a priori that Clinton would begin the primary in 
the lead and with the most money,
and that the more debating she did, and
the more visible it was, then the more
chances her rivals would have.  (E.g. with no debates at
all, or no viewership, 
she'd have the best chances to retain her 
initial lead.)  Therefore,
the Democratic debate schedule was intentionally
set up ahead of time to help Clinton.
</p><p>
That conspiracy theory was fueled by several other
facts, all seeming compatible with it.
Wikileaked emails from within the DNC unveiled the
facts that
</p><ol><li>
DNC communications chief
Luis Miranda, instructed his staff to put out, 
in a "unattributable manner," 
allegations that Bernie Sanders' 
supporters were engaged in acts of violence.
</li><li>
There also were email discussions within the DNC
about exposing &ndash; or, rather, claiming &ndash;
that Bernie Sanders was an atheist, 
because that hopefully would hurt his
popularity in the South.
</li><li>
Donna Brazile, then a journalist with CNN, 
emailed
Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri 
on 12 March
that "From time to time, I get the questions in advance."
and then used the rest of the email to
inform
Hillary Clinton ahead of time of the wording of a
question about the death penalty
to be asked her at a CNN-run "town hall" (although ostensibly
such questions were unknown to the candidates ahead of
time).  The question then indeed was asked
at the town hall on 13 March, with quite similar
wording, including re-using the numbers "1414," "1973,"
"156," and "1976"; the words were not exactly the
same, but  it later was found that the question
had undergone editing and originally
had been <i>exactly</i> the same as in Brazile's email.
Brazile was fired by CNN on 31 Oct.
after this story broke, but
was immediately hired by the DNC as "interim chair."
</li><li>
The head of the DNC, congresswoman
Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, resigned during
the Democratic National Convention in July
after this email/bias scandal broke.
However, she was immediately hired by Clinton's
presidential campaign.
</li><li>
Wasserman-Schultz shut down Sanders' access to
DNC data and had to be sued before restoring it;
also she conveniently overlooked
(despite a 
<a href="assets/documents/Bernie-2016-Letter-to-DNC-1.pdf">complaint</a>
filed by Sanders
following a <i>Washington Post</i> story about it)
what seem to me
to be blatantly illegal use by Clinton
of the DNC as a money-launderer to permit her
to effectively evade campaign-finance
donation limits.
</li><li>
Both the Sanders and O'Malley campaigns accused 
the DNC of acting in a pro-Clinton biased
manner, rather than their ostensibly
unbiased role, during the primaries. E.g.
Lis Smith, a former aide to primary 
contender Martin O'Malley, told 
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/the-fall-of-debbie-wasserman-schultz/493019/">The Atlantic</a>.
"The emails just confirmed what we already knew;
[Wasserman-Schultz] was not an honest broker
in this process. She should have been gone long ago."
And Sanders told NBC,
"Nobody has apologized. 
But this [scandal] does not come as a surprise to me or 
my supporters. There is no doubt that the DNC was
on Secretary Clinton's campaign from day one."
</li></ol>
<p>
I do not know whether the pro-Clinton bias 
of the DNC was enormous or small,
but it is clearly proven that, in at least some cases,
it existed.
</p><p>
The DNC emails were widely claimed (without any 
published proof; the evidence was secret) to have been
leaked by "Russian hackers" ultimately directed by
Vladimir Putin.  
Wikileaks and its head Julian Assange
have never revealed any of their sources and indeed
often do not <i>know</i> their sources.  However,
27-year-old DNC staffer Seth Rich was <i>murdered</i> on 10 July
(shot in the back while walking on a
street in Washington DC; he was not robbed
and the motive and killer remain unknown).
Assange then implied in a television interview
that possibly Rich might have been the source or
somehow involved, and in any case Wikileaks on
9 August offered a $20000 reward for information
leading to the arrest of Rich's killer.
</p><p>
As of this writing, it has not been collected.
</p><p>
Wikileaks head Julian Assange, and another Wikileaks
figure Craig Murray, both claimed that their source
was <i>not</i> either Russia nor indeed any "state actor"
and claimed that they both knew (in this particular case)
the identity of the leaker.
</p><p>
To explore ways in which the DNC and 
"Democratic establishment" may have put their thumbs on
the scales to favor Hillary Clinton over her top rival
(for the Democratic nomination) Bernie Sanders,
let us examine the two biggest Democratic-party-controlled states:
<b>California</b> and <b>New York</b>.
</p><p>
A policy of the DNC and the completely-Democrat-controlled 
California government, which definitely hurt 
Sanders tremendously versus Clinton,
was uncovered by investigative journalist
Greg Palast.  The issue is as follows. Sanders 
had a big advantage among "independent" voters, while Clinton
was preferred by "registered Democrats."
The former were more numerous; and not-coincidentally, USA-wide,
Sanders was preferred over Clinton.
However, what mattered for the purpose of winning the
Democratic party's presidential <i>nomination</i>
was not the USA-wide preference, but rather the preferences of
the <i>small subset</i> 
of the USA which voted in the Democratic primaries.
In "open primary" states, anybody is allowed to
vote in any party's primary, for example
a Republican, Green, or Independent
could vote in the Democratic primary
(but you must vote in at most <i>one</i> party's primary).
In "closed primary" states, only registered Democrats could.
And in California, registered independents ("NPPs")
were allowed to vote in the Democratic (but not Republican!)
party primary.

The claimed Clinton-Sanders preferences are from a
USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll 
surveying 1500 voters (19-31 May 2016)
which included 903 Democratic and 503 "likely Democratic"
voters; and the Field Research Corp. 
<a href="assets/documents/Rls2537.pdf">poll</a> 26-31 May
consisting of 1002 (79% Democrat and 21% NPP) likely voters.

http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2537.pdf
-->
There also was a Marist/WSJ poll (29-31 May)
which found either a 2 point lead for
Clinton or a 1 point lead for Sanders,
depending on how it is interpreted.
</small>
In short, all three polls agreed the race was very close;
but obviously, by far the most crucial question was
what the NPP/Dem <i>composition</i> of the Califormia
Dem-primary electorate, was going to be.
</p><p>
The answer was revealed by the 7 June official vote total
<a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/election-2016-california-results/">reported</a> by the 
<i>LA Times</i> &ndash; a huge 55.8:43.2
for Clinton, vastly outside the claimed margins of error of any of these polls!
<small>
[UPDATE: 5 weeks later, 
<a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/07/18/62624/five-weeks-later-california-s-primary-results-offi/">scpr.org</a>
claimed a revised count found Clinton had only won by 53.1 to 46.0 percent.]
</small>
So evidently, the NPPs were heavily excluded from the voter
pool, to a far greater degree than any pollster expected.
</p><p>
Why?  Well, the Democratic Party, rather than
<i>encouraging</i> as many NPPs as they could
to vote in the Democratic primary,
kept the fact that they were allowed to do that, and how,
very very quiet.  
And, more importantly, CA's <i>election officials</i>
were <i>instructed</i> in their official
training, to give NPPs ballots <i>not containing</i>
a presidential slot, <i>unless</i> the NPP in question 
then came back and <i>specifically asked</i> for a 
special "crossover" ballot
using the special magic word "crossover" that most people
would be unlikely to know.
Let us quote Palast:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="lightgreen">
In some counties like Los Angeles, it's not easy for 
an NPP to claim their right to vote in the Democratic primary 
&ndash; and in other counties, nearly impossible.
</p><p>
Example: In Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, if you don't say the magic words,
"I want a Democratic <i>crossover</i> ballot," you are 
automatically given a ballot <i>without the presidential race.</i> 
And get ready for this: if an NPP voter asks the poll worker, 
"How do I get to vote in the Democratic party primary?"
they are instructed to reply that
"NPP voters can't get Democratic ballots."
They are ordered <i>not</i> to breathe a word that the voter can get a 
"crossover" ballot that includes the presidential race.
</p><p>
I'm not kidding. This is from the official Election Officer Training Manual page 49:
</p>
<blockquote>
"A No Party Preference voter will need to request a crossover ballot from the Roster Index Officer. (Do not offer them a crossover ballot if they do not ask)."
</blockquote>
<p>
They're not kidding. Poll worker Jeff Lewis filed a description 
of the training in an official declaration to a federal court:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Someone raised their hand and asked a follow-up question: 
"So, what if someone gets a nonpartisan ballot, 
notices it doesn't have the presidential candidates 
on it, and asks you where they are?
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The answer poll workers are instructed to give: 
"Sorry, NPP ballots don't have presidential candidates on them."</i>
That's correct: even when people ask 
questions of that nature, obviously intending to vote with a party.
</blockquote>
This affidavit, and several even more 
horrifying, come from Election Justice USA, a 
non-partisan watchdog, hoping to get injunctions 
to stop this nonsense.

</p><p>
Let me throw in another complication. 
Nearly half of Californians vote by mail, 
ballots sent to your home automatically. 
Most NPP voters don't realize that, to vote in the Democratic 
primary, they must <i>bring in</i> their NPP ballot <i>with the envelope</i>, 
and say these magic words: 
"I want to surrender my ballot in return for a Democratic 'crossover' ballot."
</p><p>
Got that memorized? Because if you don't, 
if you say the wrong syllables, in some counties, 
<i>you will be denied a Democratic presidential ballot.</i>
</p><p>
...It gets far worse. There are simply not enough "crossover"
ballots <i>printed</i>. 
If they run out... [according to Election Justice's filed affadavits]
poll workers were told to give NPP voters "provisional" ballots 
even if they say the magic words "I want a crossover Democratic ballot."
As I've previously reported, provisional ballots are "placebo"
ballots that let you feel like you've voted, but you [often] haven't.
</p><p>
[Palast then noted that his KPFK co-host, Cary Harrison, an NPP,
was denied voting twice in West Hollywood.
He then drove to a new precinct as directed
and was again denied a ballot.]
</td></tr></table><p>
You can read 
<a href="assets/documents/EJreport26July16.pdf">Election Justice's Report</a> 
about this and other techniques
for biasing the primary against Sanders and 
for Clinton.  (I am not necessarily endorsing
everything this report said, but certainly 
it said many true and disturbing things.)
</p><p>
Another election-biasing ploy, 
unfortunately commonplace in the contemporary USA,
is intentionally-biased 
<a href="assets/documents/Voter.Purges.f.pdf">purging</a>.
That is, in many US states, the head of
election-counting (often with hire and fire power over
every employee) is the "secretary of state" (SoS),
often intentionally chosen to be the
single most-biased person in that state.  
(For example, Ken Blackwell, the Bush-Cheney campaign co-chair in Ohio,
was the Ohio SoS in charge of counting Ohio's 2004 votes  for
or against Bush.)
And states must purge their voter-registration lists 
periodically due to registrants dying, moving away, etc.
But the law often allows the SoS to select <i>who</i>
will be purged and when, so that, e.g, Blackwell 
conducted pre-election
purges in predominantly Democratic areas of the state.
</p><p>
In the case of the 2016 Democratic Primary in <i>New York</i> state,
Clinton as former NY senator was very well connected
with the entirely-Democratic-controlled NY state
government, and had an excellent
"machine" to deliver votes.  But Sanders was actually
born and raised in NY, specifically Brooklyn, so
was not a complete foreigner.  He lived in Vermont, 
a neighboring state
with characteristics similar to "upstate" NY.
</p><p>
So what happened in NY's Dem-primary?  To a good
approximation, Clinton won NY City and suburbs, while Sanders won
everyplace else, i.e. upstate NY, with the net
result being a big win for Clinton by a 290
Kvote margin
out of about 2 million cast.
<i>But</i>, oddly enough, there were two mysterious
<i>purges</i> of 125K voters in Brooklyn &ndash; the one borough
of NY City where Sanders might a priori have been 
expected to have an advantage &ndash; in 2015,
by the completely-Democrat-controlled NY government.
NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio described 
"the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters."
The purge was only announced in the <i>NY Times</i>
the day <i>after</i> the primary, when it became blindingly apparent
that huge numbers of Brooklyn voters had been turned away.
Both purges were illegal to perform at their dates
under NY state law, but nevertheless occurred.
This supposedly was a mere "mistake."
</p><p>
<!-- http://www.wnyc.org/story/brooklyn-voter-purge-hit-hispanics-hardest -->
Also, for other
mysterious reasons, polls were open for different amounts of time
in different places, with the Sanders upstate areas getting
fewer hours, and the Clinton NY City and nearby areas getting more hours.
</p><blockquote>
To quote a pre-election announcement:
"In New York city and counties of 
Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, 
Rockland, Orange, Putnam and Erie,
polls will open at 6am-9pm (EST);
all other counties will have polling hours between noon and 9pm (EST)."
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, amazingly enough, Clinton 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Democratic_primary,_2016#Results_by_county#Results_by_county">won</a>: 
NY City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester,
Rockland, Orange, and Erie,
with Sanders winning only Putnam among the 
long-hours locations!  Meanwhile among NY's 50 short-hours counties,
Clinton won only 2.  (And actually the situation seems even more
biased than this makes it appear since, based on voter complaints, it
seems the hours in <i>reality</i>
often were more biased than the pre-planned <i>claimed</i> hours.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile, in a related (?) story, Donald Trump claimed at many times
during the Republican primaries that they were "rigged."
Those claims were not entirely divorced from reality.
(Trump also seemed to agree the Democratic primaries
were rigged, although they were not his
main focus.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Greg Palast's conspiracy theory about "CrossCheck":</b>
is discussed <a href="CrossCheckFoo.html">here</a>.
He grandiloquently claimed that was how "the election was stolen."
CrossCheck was indeed a suspicious and dubious program
that did look designed to bias the general election to
give Trump an artificial advantage.  
However, Palast's numbers simply do
not add up to enough of an effect to have
stolen the election.  At most,
CrossCheck "stole" Michigan &ndash; but no other 
state, not even in combination
with Johnson &amp; Stein's spoiler effects.

they would not have voted at all in a two-candidate race, with

<!-- NYT question titled "Vote in a two-candidate race" -->
</p><p>
Therefore, Johnson &amp; Stein by running <i>did</i>
hurt Clinton &ndash; and presumably <i>did</i> "spoil" Michigan, i.e.
caused Trump to win Michigan instead of Clinton.
However, their spoiler effects, even combined, 
were <i>not</i> enough to swing any other state toward Trump.
And Trump still had enough electoral votes to win even if Michigan
and Wisconsin both switched to Clinton.
</p><p>
So Johnson and Stein were <i>not</i> spoilers, i.e. Trump still
would have defeated Clinton in a 2-way race.

<a name="clintspoil"><h3> Was <i>Clinton</i> a spoiler? Yes. </h3></a>
<p>
Although the press devoted a fair amount of sound and fury 
to the prospect
that Johnson might be a spoiler, it
failed to mention the far more likely possibility
that Hillary Clinton was a spoiler.  
The decisive questions are:
</p><ol>
<li> if Clinton (and possibly also Stein)
had dropped out of the (general election)
race, leaving it as a head-to-head battle
between Johnson and Trump, would <b>Johnson</b> have won?
</li><li>
if Clinton 
had dropped out  shortly before the end of the
<i>primary</i> race, causing Sanders to instead become the
Democratic Party nominee, would <b>Sanders</b> have won?
</li></ol><p>
My answers are:
</p><ol>
<li> Yes, with probability=60%.  (See below.)
</li><li> <a href="#XvsTrumpPairPollTable">Yes</a>, with probability&gt;95%.
This is based on 21 Sanders-vs-Trump pairwise polls, every one won by Sanders
by margins ranging from 4% to 24%.  (And note 4% far exceeds the maximum
popular vote margin ever attained by an electoral vote loser.)
It also is based on the known official final results, which indicated
that even a slight improvement over
Clinton's pairwise performance versus Trump, would have sufficed
to make her win; and the fact (based on polls) that Sanders did outperform
Clinton substantially (i.e. margin greater by about 8% of the
number of voters) by that measure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only way to dispute this is to speculate that,
if Sanders had been nominated,
then new attacks would have come against Sanders, 
which would have been much more effective in hurting him relative to Trump,
than the attacks which did come against Clinton.  
This seems unlikely because Clinton simply had more severe-seeming
attackable problems than Sanders did.  
There was, for example, no ongoing FBI investigation
of Sanders, he never was paid over $100,000 to give a speech,
and he'd had a lifelong record (unequalled by any other major rival) 
of refusing both PAC money
and all large individual dollar contributions.
As one commentator put it, Clinton was "the Queen of Wall Street,
while Sanders is the cleanest major politician during
the last 50 years."
</li></ol><p>
In other words, not only was Clinton almost certainly a spoiler, but
it indeed is more likely than not that she was a spoiler
in <i>two different ways.</i>
</p><p>
<b>Justification of answer 1.</b>
Unfortunately, "pairwise" polls about any pair besides the two
major-party candidates, are rarely performed by pollsters in
the contemporary USA.  However, one 
<a href="assets/documents/OctoberJohnsonWeldPoll.txt">was</a> 
performed and released to the media (which of course then almost entirely ignored it)
by the Johnson/Weld campaign:
</p><blockquote>
<b>Poll Question:</b>
For whom would you vote for president if the choice was between 
Republican Donald Trump 
and Libertarian Gary Johnson?
(Nationwide telephone 
<a href="assets/documents/OctoberJohnsonWeldPoll.txt">poll</a>  
on 8-9 October 2016.) <!-- 1006 polled? -->
<br>
<b>Result:</b>

</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Johnson-Trump difference 
was 33 pollees out of the 757 total respondents, and this really
should be regarded as 33&plusmn;13.56 after
putting in a &plusmn;1&sigma; error bar, if
we (rather optimistically) just use errors for <i>one</i> of the two candidates.
And if we assume (as a worst case assumption)
that the errors for both candidates are exactly anti-correlated, then
33&plusmn;27.12.
Consulting a 
<a href="NormTble.html">table</a> of
the <a href="NHack.html">normal distribution</a>, we see that this 
2.43&sigma; or 1.22&sigma; result indicates
99.25% or 88.88% confidence that Johnson would have defeated Trump &ndash;
at the time of the poll and provided the undecideds are ignored.
</p><p><small>
Also asked: "Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Gary Johnson?"
Fav=15.2%, Unfav=30.0%, NoOpinion=38.1%, Never heard of GJ=16.7%.
And: "For whom would you vote for president if the choice was between 
Democrat Hillary Clinton
and Libertarian Gary Johnson?"
Clinton=345, Johnson=280, Undecided=132, (Total=757).
</small></p><p>
This claim can be disputed.  
It is based on only one poll, and that poll was released by
a biased group, the Johnson/Weld campaign.  I doubt that the poll was a lie.
(The reason a money-limited campaign pays for a poll is to find out the truth.
And if it were a lie, then why not also try to create a more 
pro-Johnson impression about
the "Johnson losing to Clinton" simultaneous pairwise result, and why publicize
the low approval this poll found for Johnson, considerably lower than 
in independent public polls up til then?)
However, if the Johnson/Weld campaign had conducted (say) <i>five</i> polls, but only
released the <i>one</i> that made them look the best versus Trump
&ndash; which seems fairly likely &ndash;
then the public would get a
distorted impression from that one poll, and to correct for that
our "99.25% or 88.88% confidence" claims would
need to be <b>downgraded</b> by a factor of 5 ("Bonferroni correction")
to obtain (as lower bounds) <b>96.25% or 44.40% confidence.</b>  
The former figure would mean Johnson still
is a fairly good bet; the latter means Johnson-Trump
was too close a pair to call.
</p><p><small>
More precisely: 100-99.25=0.75, multiply by 5 to get 3.75,
and 100-3.75=96.25.
</small></p><p>
Furthermore (the disputers could continue), 
this poll was conducted at a comparatively unpropitious (?) time for
Donald Trump: 8-9 October, shortly after the release of the
"Access Hollywood" videotape in which Trump in 2005
boasted of his ability to 
"grab [women] by the pussy"
and indeed "do anything" to them with impunity because he was a "star."
This probably was not Trump's lowest point &ndash; things would
seem to have gotten even worse for him somewhat later, in view of the
following timeline:
</p><ul>
<li>
Morning of 8 Oct 2016: "Access Hollywood" videotape released by <i>Washington Post</i> in 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html">article</a> 
by David A. Fahrenthold.
</li><li>
Night of 9 Oct: Second (of three) Debates between Trump &amp; Clinton.
Trump, asked about the tape, says it was merely "locker room talk" and denies ever actually doing
what he said he'd done on the tape, in reality.
<blockquote>
<b>Debate moderator Anderson Cooper:</b> Have you ever done those things?
<br>
<b>Trump:</b> No I have not.
</blockquote>
</li><li>
12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 27 Oct:
starting on 12 October and continuing over the next two weeks, 
woman after woman came forward to the media
claiming Trump indeed had "groped" them without their consent, 
often quite similarly to
the way he'd explained it on the videotape.  There also were more who'd
made the accusations publicly and/or in court
well before 2015, but obtained little media attention at those
earlier times.  Many of these women
were found by journalists (upon checking) to have corroboration, 
such as people they'd
told about it years before the Clinton-Trump race began.
In all, <i>The Guardian</i> by 27 October had 
<a href="GuardianTrumpSexTally.html">tallied</a> 24 women making such
allegations about events spaced within the preceding 30 years. 
</li><li>
Night of 19 Oct: In the third and final presidential debate, 
Trump suggested that the rush of accusations was either orchestrated by the 
Clinton campaign or the product of women seeking "10 minutes of fame."
Plus, in speeches he called his accusers "horrible, horrible liars"
and said that after the election he would sue them all.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Despite not being the lowest, 8-9 October likely was a comparatively 
low moment for Trump,
plausibly lower than on election day (8 Nov).  Further complicating the issue
was the fact that a lot of the official voting occurred "early," 
namely during the period 29 Sept.-8 Nov.  (The allowed early-voting
periods varied depending on state but participating states typically began it
about 22 Oct.)
</p><p>
The final grounds for disputation were that this poll 
pertained to the <i>popular</i>
vote (predicting 4.4% pairwise margin for Johnson-Trump),
whereas what would actually matter would be the <i>electoral</i> vote.
Historically, the popular and electoral winners have coincided
over 90% of the time.
And the whole judgment ignores the "undecideds," whose number was substantial.
</p><p>
My bottom line:
pending any further pairwise poll data 
(since at present I know of no other such poll),
my personal estimate is that there was about a 
<b>60% chance</b> that Clinton 
was a spoiler since Johnson would have defeated Trump head to head.
</p><p>
If so, this poll plus the official election results also
would imply the existence of a 
<b><a href="CondorcetCycles.html">Condorcet cycle</a></b>
</p><center>
Johnson &gt; Trump &gt; Clinton &gt; Johnson
</center>
<p>
where "A&gt;B" means "A would defeat B in a head-to-head race using official system."
</p><p>
Not only that, it would show that Clinton not only was a spoiler with the official
election method, but <i>also</i> was an
<a href="IRV1519.html">IRV</a>
<a href="SpoilerChance.html">spoiler</a>,
i.e. by running, Clinton prevented Johnson's victory over Trump
using <b><a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff voting</a></b>.  
</p><p><small>
In other words, anti-Trump pro-Clinton voters, by <i>honestly voting</i>
Clinton-top, would with instant runoff voting (as well as
with the official actually-used voting system) have made a <i>strategic mistake.</i>  
They would have been better off dishonestly voting Johnson top, 
because that would have caused a better election result in their view.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is often <a href="Dean2016Refut.html">contended</a> &ndash; of course utterly 
<a href="CompleteIdioticIRV2.html">falsely</a> &ndash; by
instant runoff proponents that IRV "eliminates" the spoiler effect and the "wasted vote" 
problem, or somehow weakens 2-party domination permitting "third parties" to win.
This 2016 election provides
yet another refutation, perhaps the most prominent, of those false claims.
</small></p>

<!-- Ballot access:
Trump, Clinton, Johson were on ballot in all 50 states and DC.
Stein only 44+DC.  McMullin only 11.
Castle only 24.
-->

<a name="irv"><h3> Instant Runoff Voting (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>) 
would <i>not</i> have altered the winner </h3></a>
<p>
And of course 
<b>Trump</b> <i>still would have won the general 
election with instant runoff voting</i> conducted
either within states, or within the electoral college.
However with a straight nationwide vote (no electoral college)
<b>Clinton</b>
would have won with IRV.
</p><p>
These facts are proven by the official election results combined with the
CBS News exit poll's
question about "second choices" of third-party voters.
</p><p><small>
The only possible way to dispute this would be to hope that
strategic lying on the official (plurality style) ballots
was so vast, that actually with  instant runoff voting,
the voters would have been way more honest and less 
<a href="NESD.html">naively-strategic</a>, causing
Clinton and Trump <i>not</i> anymore to reach the "final two."
However, that hope is quashed by
the <a href="#CivisPoll">Civis online poll</a>, which actually <i>did</i>
ask their respondents to provide rank-order ballots,
and indeed did find that Trump and Clinton were the final two,
with 43.8% ranking Clinton top and 43.8%
ranking Trump top.
(Civis also approximately confirmed the "25 to 15" 
<a href="#gjspoil">finding</a> about
Trump/Clinton preferences of Johnson and Stein voters from
the CBS exit poll.)
<!-- 
(And if &gt;75% do that, then it is mathematically impossible with IRV for
anybody besides Clinton or Trump to win.)
-->
The difference between 43.8% and the 10.4% who ranked anybody
besides Clinton and Trump top is so great that, despite issues
I have with the quality of the Civis poll, this particular claim
seems indisputable.
</small></p>

<a name="hugedist"><h3>This election was a huge distortion of democracy </h3></a>
<p>
Obviously, those pairwise results for Johnson-vs-Clinton and Johnson-vs-Trump
demonstrate that Johnson, in truth, was <i>vastly</i> more supported
by the American public than one would suspect from his
3.3% sliver of the official plurality vote.
(Which also is independently
demonstrated by the <a href="#appPost">approval</a>- and 
<a href="#sv2">score</a>-voting polls
that we shall discuss soon.)
Indeed, it even is arguable that Johnson actually should have <i>won</i>
the presidency.
</p><p>
This enormous distortion is caused by strategic voting imperatives
("must not 'waste my vote' by voting for anybody besides the leading two")
which in the earlier USA 2000 election were known from NES data to have caused <i>90%</i> of
honestly Nader- or Buchanan-favoring voters to vote for somebody else.
This is a well known defect of the USA's abysmal
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system.
</p><p>
<b>A different way to see that strategic distortion at work:</b>
The top 7 states for Gary Johnson (highest 7 percentages
of popular vote) were, in descending order,
</p><center>
NM (9.3%), ND (6.2%), AK (5.9%), OK (5.8%), MN (5.7%), SD (5.6%), WY (5.2%).
</center><p>
<i>All</i> those states were "easy call" states in which
the |Trump-Clinton| margin ranged from 8.2% (NM) up to over 45%
of the vote (WY).
Meanwhile, in the 8 <a href="#closestates">closest</a>
states &ndash; those with |Trump-Clinton| margins below 3% &ndash;
Johnson always got &le;5.1%.
</p><p>
That is presumably because those states' voters knew that 
voting for Johnson incurred extremely tiny risk of causing a "spoiler"
scenario.  There is one exception: 
The 8th-most pro-Johnson state, Maine (ME), 
which voted 5.1% for Johnson, actually did have
a small |Trump-Clinton| margin (2.7%),
<i>but</i> Maine is one of the two 
states that awards its electoral votes by congressional district
rather than statewide, and those districts are "gerrymandered,"
so again its voters knew they had low spoiler risk.
</p><p>
Similarly, but more clearly:
the top 17 states (regarding DC as a "state" for this purpose)
most-supporting Jill Stein,
<i>all</i> were <i>extremely</i> "easy call" states with
|Trump-Clinton| margins ranging between 12% and 85%
&ndash; plus Maine:
</p><center>
HI, OR, VT, KS, ME,
AK, CA, MT, MA, CT,
WA, NY, DC, IL, DE, 
RI, MD. 
</center><p>
This extra clarity 
was perhaps because Green voters were more cautious than 
Libertarian voters due to their previous bad <a href="Flor2000Res.html">experience</a>
with Ralph Nader as a Green Party spoiler in 2000.
</p>
<a name="CivisPoll"></a>
<p>
<b>Yet another signature of the huge distortion:</b>
An online post-election 
<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/25/13733322/instant-runoff-ranked-voting-2016">poll</a>
by
Civis Analytics (1084 registered voters who said they'd voted,
Nov. 15-16, poll commissioned by Vox.com)
found that the percentages of voters who
"found [candidate] acceptable or somewhat acceptable,"
and who would have voted for that candidate in a head-to-head race
versus Clinton, were respectively
</p><table>
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>Candidate</th>
<th>Acceptable or Somewhat</th>
<th>Preferred over Clinton</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>Hillary Clinton</td><td>48.4</td><td>&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Donald Trump</td><td>46.7</td><td>49.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gary Johnson</td><td>32.4</td><td>45.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jill Stein</td><td>29.0</td><td>42.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Evan McMullin</td><td>25.9</td><td>39.1</td></tr>

</table>
<!-- 
http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/25/13733322/instant-runoff-ranked-voting-2016 
-->
<p>
These percentages are vastly greater than 
anybody would have naively guessed from these candidates'
official vote shares.
</p><p>
<small>
[But I warn the reader that the Civis poll because based on
a sample of <i>online</i>
voters with unstated "demographic correction factors,"
is of less reliability than genuinely random telephone polls 
conducted by established pollsters who publish full polling reports.
My requests to Civis for their raw data, fuller data, or a report, 
all were ignored. Despite those problems, I think the effects we
just reported are so enormous that they cannot be disputed.]

<a name="enormcost"><h3> Enormous costs incurred by USA's foolish use of
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting system
</h3></a>
<p>
The enormous costs the USA (and hence world) are paying for foolishly using that system
were quite clearly demonstrated yet again by this 2016 election.  
Here is a list of features of Trump/2016 &ndash; most or all of which were bad &ndash;
which set new records:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
On election, Trump with 37 or 38% approval
was the <i>least-approved</i>
president
(during the era of
approval-style polling, i.e. starting in the late 1940s, at
the <i>date of first assuming office</i>, except in Trump's case
we use election day).
Furthermore, Clinton, if she had won, <i>also</i> would have been 
the least-approved
ever, with 41 or 42% approval.
The previous low was Gerald Ford with 47%
initial approval, as we see in this graphic from Gallup.  
(Also Jimmy Carter and Harry Truman 
jointly held the record for
lowest approval <i>time-averaged</i> over their entire terms, 
at about 45.5% each.  Since evidently approval usually <i>decreases</i> during 
presidential terms we have good a priori reason to suspect Trump
will be one of the worst presidents in the last 100 years.)
<img src="assets/images/GallupSittingPresApproval.png" alt="Gallup presidential approval versus time plot">
<br>
Furthermore, 
according to several pollsters using various approval- and score-based
measures, Trump was the least-wanted among all his historical
rivals (i.e. major-party presidential nominees of the past) 
at the same month
in their campaigns, during April, May, June and July &ndash;
and Clinton also would have held that record all those
months too if it were not for Trump.
(<a href="assets/images/ClintonTrumpApprovalVtime.png">Example</a>,
<a href="assets/images/enten-generaldislike-1.png">another</a>, 
<a href="assets/images/enten-generaldislike-2.png">another</a>.)
The previous worst had been Barry Goldwater in 1964.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Update:
Additional post-election polls found that, e.g,
Trump approval 
was 37% favorable and 51% unfavorable 
in a Quinnipiac nationwide telephone poll of 899 voters nationwide
on 5-9 January 2017.
So there is no question Trump was the least-approved president 
(on day 1) ever recorded.

By this reckoning lowest ever was Ford with 47 or Obama 52.
HRC at 41-42 and DJT at 37-38 indeed blow those away.
Also note GW Bush had both highest-ever 90 (Sept 2001)
and near-lowest-ever 25 in Oct 2008.
Lowest ever was Nixon 24 in July-Aug 1974 and Truman 22 in Feb 1962.
Obama during 14-20  Nov 2016 had 56% job-approval, 41% disapproval.
-->
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the public's job-approval rating for <i>congress</i>
was also abysmal. The all-time low according to Gallup during
1974-2016, was 9% approval, achieved in Nov. 2013.  By early Nov. 2015,
congress had improved to 11% approval and 86% disapproval.
(The highest ever had been 84% approval in October 2001.)
This was probably due to a Republican policy of total obstructionism
in both branches of congress throughout the Obama administration, combined with
several times threatening to shut down the entire government as a blackmail
tactic.

This was based on Politifact's checks of 331 statements by Trump; 70% of
his statements fell in their mostly-false, false, 
or pants-on-fire categories!  
And here is the Washington Post's independent 
fact-checking summary of H.Clinton and Trump as of 3 Nov. 2016:
<br><img src="assets/images/ClTrWPfactck3Nov2016.png">
</li><li>
With 
<a href="GuardianTrumpSexTally.html">24 women</a> 
publicly accusing Trump of 
<i>sex-assaults</i> or other sexual misconduct, that surely also
was a record.
</li><li>
Trump, at 70, was the <i>oldest</i> ever to ascend to the US presidency.
But fear not &ndash; despite his age, Trump's physician provided a 
<a href="assets/images/TrumpDocLetter.png">letter</a> 
to the press "stating unequivocally" that Trump would be
"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."
</li><li>
Trump was the <i>least qualified</i> US president ever, 
in the sense that he was the only one with
<i>no</i> previous government
(civilian or military) job experience.  (In contrast,
Hillary Clinton's extensive experiences would have
made her one of the most qualified 
presidents ever, while Gary Johnson was former governor of New Mexico
as well as a wealthy self-made businessman.)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trump supporters could console themselves with the fact that his
VP Mike Pence (governor of Indiana 2013-2016, and US congressman 2001-2013)
had 15 years of experience.  Unfortunately during his
12 years as congressman, while Pence wrote 90 bills and resolutions,
he failed to get even a single one to pass into law.
</li><li>
Trump was the <i>most litigious</i> US president ever,
as is detailed in <i>USA Today</i>'s
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/07/new-usa-today-interactive-database-shows-trump-lawsuits-surpass-4000/86809010/">interactive</a>
database
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/">Three decades, 4095 lawsuits</a>.
(And probably there are more than 4095 based on the fact that
<i>USA Today</i>'s tally kept growing as they kept finding more,
for many months.  Their 
initial
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/">tally</a>
in June 2016 was only about 3500. 
Also, Trump <i>threatened</i> to sue people
far more often than he actually did &ndash; 
probably tens of thousands of times.)
Hundreds of the lawsuits were the result of Trump
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/">refusing to
pay</a> people he'd done business with.
Even if Trump spent only
1 day per lawsuit, excluding weekends and holidays,
that would mean at least <i>16 out of those 30 years</i>
of his life consisted of him either suing or being sued!
Probably that would be physically impossible for 
almost anybody else to accomplish, even if they tried.
At <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/25/pending-lawsuits-donald-trump-presidency/92666382/">least</a>
75 of the lawsuits still are in progress as Trump enters
the Oval Office, most notably cases alleging his "Trump University"
was a fraudulent "get rich quick" scam...
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
...and one of the three rape cases.  (The other 
two rapes were settled. The third, still ongoing, 
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-bloom/why-the-new-child-rape-ca_b_10619944.html">case</a>
alleges both Trump and billionaire and convicted/jailed sex offender
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>
in 1994 both repeatedly and collaboratively
raped a 13-year-old girl &ndash; the plaintiff, called "Jane Doe" for 
mysterious legal purposes in the case.  The lawsuit includes
a <i>witness</i> of 4 of those rapes by Trump, which means it should
be taken more seriously than most rape cases, because witnesses of
rapes are rare.)
<b>Update:</b> The Trump university case
was settled after Trump agreed to pay $25 million in damages,
thus refunding about 50% of the tuition paid by the 6000 plaintiffs.
</li><li>
Trump was the <i>most married &amp; divorced</i> president ever, 
with 3 marriages and 2 divorces (so far).  They always 
are younger than him and keep getting younger:
<pre>
       <u>Wife</u>           <u>Her birthyear</u>    <u>Country</u>    <u>Married years</u>   
Ivana Marie Zelnickova       1949   Czechoslovakia   1977-1992
Marla Maples                 1963   USA (Georgia)    1993-1999
Melania Knavs                1970   Slovenia         2005-
</pre>
Only one preceding president divorced even once:
Ronald Reagan. That presumably is because
presidents tend to have excellent "people/relationship skills,"
good career success,
and high attractiveness,
and as a side effect their marriages succeed more often than
most people's.
</li><li>
Trump as far as I can tell was the only major presidential candidate
ever to publicly call for a foreign power to spy on the USA, 
and in particular on his political opponent:
<blockquote>
Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find 
the 30,000 emails that are missing [from emails that Hillary Clinton turned over to the State Department].
I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. 
Let's see if that happens. That will be next. Yes, sir.
<br> &ndash;
Trump in a lengthy news conference in Doral, Florida
[Ashley Parker &amp; David E. Sanger:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html">
Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton's Missing Emails</a>
<i>New York Times</i> 27 July 2016; electronic version
includes video of Trump saying it.]
</blockquote>
Also, if it is correct (as many US intelligence agencies claimed)
that Russian intelligence made a concerted effort
to influence this election in Trump's favor, then
(a) in view of how close the election was, that effort likely was successful,
and (b) this marks the first time in US history that
any such attempt was successful.
</li><li>
Some have argued that a better system 
than "<i>demo</i>cracy" would be "<i>episto</i>cracy" 
(a coined word meaning "rule by the knowledgeable") 
in which, only "knowledgeable" people would be
allowed to vote, or more knowledge would give your vote greater weight,
or some such.
I am dubious epistocracy could be safely accomplished.  
But regardless of that debate,
this election <i>did</i> provide some experiments about precisely
that question.
Namely, a set of people unquestionably more-knowledgeable than 
the average voter, were
the <i>editorial boards of major US newspapers</i>.
Here is a tally by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016">wikipedia</a>
of the endorsements made by the USA's 100 top
(reckoned by paid circulations)  newspapers:
<table align="center">
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>#newspapers</th><th bgcolor="aqua">2016 presidential endorsement</th></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>Hillary Clinton (Democ)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Gary Johnson (Liber)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><i>Not</i> Trump (anti-endorsement!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Donald Trump (Repub)</td></tr>
<tr><td>34</td><td>(No endorsement made)</td></tr>
</table>
(This compares with the preceding 2012 election,
in which the major newspaper endorsements split approximately 51/48/1 percent
for Obama/Romney/Johnson.)
So it seems likely that 2016 was the single most-lopsidedly-bad 
US election ever,
reckoned by major newspaper endorsements; and this "epistocracy"
differed quite drastically from the actual democracy.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A different set of people more knowledgeable than average 
about Trump were the <i>residents
of Manhattan</i> where Trump (who lived there, in the penthouse of
"Trump Tower," since its construction ended in 1983) 
had been a major figure for 35 years.
Manhattan's vote 
<a href="http://www.vibe.com/2016/11/nyc-boroughs-favored-hillary-clinton-over-donald-trump/">was</a>: 
Clinton 515481, Trump 58935, approximately a 9:1 ratio.
(Plus Stein and Johnson each got about 1%.)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, another set of 
people more knowledgeable than average 
were <i>former presidents.</i>
All former presidents still alive at the time of this election
(Obama, Bush II, W.Clinton, Bush I, Carter) unanimously said &ndash;
either to the press or to multiple
sources who told the press &ndash; they
were voting for Clinton, with the exception
of Bush II, who told 
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/08/george-w-bush-rush-limbaugh-vote/93508220/">USA Today</a> 
he'd intentionally <i>not</i>
voted for President.
</li><li>
Trump's bigtime public political career began in March 2011 with his
trumpeting (e.g. on television)
of the <i>"birther conspiracy."</i> This was
the theory that then-sitting President Obama was not really born in
Hawaii USA, because his birth certificates were fraudulent
&ndash; he'd somehow been brought as a young child to the USA by
evil forces who'd pre-programmed him to become an evil president? &ndash;
and therefore Obama actually was ineligible to be president.
Trump was by far the loudest voice for the "Birthers."
He claimed he'd sent investigators to Hawaii to research the matter
("and they can't believe what they're finding!"),
but never said who they were or what they found.
Finally in September 2016, Trump for the first time
publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the USA &ndash;
then falsely claimed the rumors to the contrary had been started by 
<i>Hillary Clinton</i> in 2008!

<i>New York Times</i> 16 Sept. 2016.]
This is probably
the only time in world history that a prominent national leader
publicly disavowed his own signature career-commencing act, 
<i>and</i> then attributed it to his rival (who of course had been attacking
and ridiculing it all along).
</li><li>
Trump was the only major presidential candidate
since the 1960s to <i>refuse to release his taxes.</i>
</li><li>
Trump may or may not have been the <i>wealthiest</i> US President.
The three richest were D.J.Trump, J.F.Kennedy, and 
George Washington; but I am unable to decide the correct ordering among them.
Trump thoughout his life 
greatly exaggerated his wealth.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With economic inequality at or nearing record-high levels in the 2016 USA 
(mainly due to the rich effectively compounding their money faster than the
rest of us, a trend which started with Reagan's great lowering of
high-end tax rates in the early 1980s, and probably helped by the onset of
"globalization") it seems unlikely that Trump's proposals for <i>further</i> lowering
of high end and corporate tax rates &ndash; apparently designed
to enhance his personal financial situation? &ndash; are going to improve that.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trump's actual wealth is extremely unclear because:
<ol type="a"><li>
He refused to release his taxes.
</li><li>
The contracts and loans he signs often were kept secret.
</li><li>
Many of "his" holdings actually are partly or entirely owned
by others. For example near the end of his Presidential campaign (4 Nov.) the 
"Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower" in Toronto &ndash;
the tallest residential building in Canada &ndash; was placed into receivership
just 4 years after Trump and his children conducted its opening ceremony.
Yet another bankruptcy for The Donald?  Actually not, since according to press reports
his company had not built it and his ownership share was zero!  The Trump Organization
merely <i>managed</i> its operations, plus ran various misleading promotions
which made it <i>seem</i> like the developer/owner.
That all turned out to be bad news for the actual owners.
</li><li>
Trump's business is a privately held corporation
&ndash; in contrast to <i>publicly</i> held, i.e. stock-traded, corporations,
which have legal disclosure requirements.
</li></ol>
Actually Trump, in 1995 when presumably 
in severe financial trouble, <i>did</i> create
a stock-traded corporation "DJT," raising $140 million in its initial
public offering.  He then talked it up and made things look promising,
getting its stock price to multiply 2.5&times; in 1 year.
At that point, according to 
<a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/10/trump-hotel-casinos-pay-failure/">Fortune</a> 
magazine,
"Trump's 41% stake [was] worth around $400 million,
[which] was perhaps the only time a major pillar of [Trump's]
net worth was verifiable and transparent."
Then Trump switched to basically acting as a "corporate raider" on his
own corporation (he had complete control as
chairman of its board for its entire existence,
CEO for about half, and the stock he owned was of a special class
unavailable to others that carried many more votes), 
sucking its assets and market value out into his own pocket
via a variety of absurd transactions with other Trump-owned companies
(while leaving its debt in place), plus paying himself enormous bonuses for
his "excellent performance" &ndash;
albeit causing its investors to lose 90 cents out of each invested dollar
by early 2005 after it declared bankruptcy with a net declared loss of $647 million
(it had lost money every year).  
The investors were virtually wiped out, but it was
an excellent killing for The Donald.
<img src="assets/images/DJTtwoPlots.png" width="100%" alt="Two plots of DJT stock performance">
</td></tr></table>
As you can see from the graphics, DJT vastly underperformed both the stock
market as a whole, and its casino-stock segment.
Indeed, it was by far the single worst performing among all casino stocks.  
Aggregated over the 3 years
2000, 2001, and 2002 (observe DJT's "excellent" performance during
that period on the lefthand graphic), 
DJT paid Trump $4.25 million in salaries, $8.7 million
in bonuses and/or "other compensation," and $1.5 million in stock options.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After DJT's demise, Trump immediately did it again, in December 2004 creating TRMP,
his second publicly traded corporation (consisting largely of remnants of DJT),
whose fate was similar.
At one campaign speech I witnessed,
Trump waved an official-looking piece of paper,
and said it was his latest "net worth" which "just came in" and read $12 billion.
Meanwhile
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/09/28/the-definitive-look-at-donald-trumps-wealth-new/#739063697e2d#739063697e2d">Forbes</a> Magazine in 2016 estimated it at $3.7 billion,
<a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/23/doland-trump-net-worth/">Fortune</a> at

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-19/trump-is-richer-in-property-and-deeper-in-debt-in-new-valuation">Bloomberg News</a> 
at $3.0 billion.
At the other end of the scale, 
Trump's biographer, the financial journalist David Cay Johnston,
estimated Trump actually was worth below $1 billion.
<blockquote><small>
Johnston wrote the 2016 book
<a href="http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-making-of-donald-trump/">The 
making of Donald Trump</a> which recounts many stories of how 
Trump exaggerated his wealth and about his illegal, unethical, and/or unsavory
business practices. Those caused Trump's fellow New York zillionaire
and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, estimated to be worth $42.7 billion,
to comment
"if Trump wants to run the nation like he's run his business, God help us!"
A larger biography by two <i>Washington Post</i> journalists is
Michael Kranish &amp; Marc Fisher:
<a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Trump-Revealed/Michael-Kranish/9781501155772">Trump

and a personal recounting of 
Jack O'Donnell's experiences working for Trump as his casino manager is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumped!_(book)">Trumped!</a> (1991).
O'Donnell paints Trump as an irresponsible mismanager, a huge narcissist
and braggart, the biggest gambler
he ever encountered, a philanderer, and a racist.
</small></blockquote>
</li><li>
But Trump definitely <i>does</i> hold this record: Trump is 
the president who had, at one point,
the largest <i>negative</i> wealth, after enormous bankruptcies.  
Indeed Trump may not only
hold this record among US presidents, but is in a small group of
contenders for the <i>world record</i> as the person, in <i>all
world history</i>, with the greatest personal debt in bankruptcies!
In a nutshell the situation was this:  Trump borrowed heavily, especially
to build/buy huge casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
For example he financed his "Trump Taj Mahal" casino in 1990 with
"junk bonds" at an extraordinarily high 14% interest rate.
After it went under in 1991, the enterprise was $3 billion in debt.  
Trump also <i>personally guaranteed</i> a lot of his 
debts, i.e using his own personal wealth as collateral, and
<i>re</i>using that same wealth as more collateral to get different
loans from different lenders (who did not know about the previous loans,
since Trump kept their terms private). 
Then in 1992 his "Trump Castle" (opened in 1985) filed for bankruptcy.
And then again in 1992
his also-huge Atlantic City property, 
the "Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino," was crushed beneath $550 million in debt
landing Trump in bankruptcy court a third time.
Then again in 1992, he filed
for bankruptcy on the "Trump Plaza" hotel in New York City.
About that time, Trump later told The Washington Post, he passed 
a beggar in New York and told his then-wife, model Marla Maples, 
"You see that man? Right now he's worth $900 million more than me."
[David S. Hilzenrath and Michelle Singletary:
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401731.html?tid=a_inl">Trump went broke, but stayed on top</a>,
<i>Washington Post</i> 29 Nov. 1992.]
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a result, Trump should have been personally bankrupt on an enormous scale.
The only reason that did not happen is the old story that "if you default
on a $20000 loan, that's your problem. If it's 
$500 million, that's the bank's problem."
Trump's creditors held a conference and agreed (after rancorous
internal disputes) to accept pennies on the dollar,
take over ownership and management control of those casinos, and
allow Trump to financially survive, as opposed to completely wiping him out,
in the hope that he might be able to recover some of their money later.
But the damage continued.
In 2004, Trump faced his fifth corporate bankruptcy,
when "Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts"
became buried under $1.8 billion in debt.
Then in 2009, "Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc." (TRMP)
became his sixth corporate
bankruptcy after missing a $53 million bond interest payment. 
After its $4 share price plunged to about 25 cents it was delisted from the NASDAQ.
(As of 2016 some online financial information sites still list it with
share price apparently frozen
at about 6 cents, with trading volume zero.)
After some recovery 
it declared bankruptcy yet again in 2014
(which perhaps should count as Trump's seventh bankruptcy?)
and continues on, but now as a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises
and with ticker symbol now "TER." 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So evidently, billions of dollars in loans to Trump and his
Organization were never paid back. 
That amounts to a major component of his estimated total wealth.
Indeed if Johnston's estimate that Trump's wealth is below $1 billion is
correct, then Trump actually got substantially
more money in never-repaid loans,
than his total fortune.
</li><li>
According to the <i>Washington Post</i>,
Trump holds the record, by far, as the US president with
the largest and <i>most conflicts of interest.</i> 
(Update: in a news conference 11 January 2017, Trump refused either to
sell his businesses or to place his assets in a "blind trust"
while serving as president, which would seem to bring him into
immediate enormous conflict with the "emoluments clause" of
the US constitution and also contradicting numerous
vague claims he'd made during his campaign. 
Trump also appointed his son-in-law Jared Kushner
as "senior advisor," seeming to bring him into immediate conflict with
anti-nepotism act of 1967.)
One problem was that, after his huge casino-bankruptcies, 
essentially all US banks refused ever to loan Trump any money again.
He however was able to obtain financing from foreign banks &ndash;
which are known to
include (the highly corrupt) Deutsche Bank, several Japanese banks,
and the National Bank of China,
albeit with Trump continuing to keep his finances private 
it is difficult to see the whole story &ndash;
although supposedly only under very restrictive terms
which give those banks unusually large amounts of power over him.
Also, Trump's son Eric claimed during the 2016 campaign that
the Trumps' major construction projects 
were now mainly in Russia; he is also known to have projects
in India, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, 
United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, and China.
Trump also, as election day approached, had an upcoming labor
dispute in Las Vegas, to
be mediated by the NLRB that he (as president) would <i>appoint</i>;
the anti-Trump side could be argued by lawyers from the Justice Department, whose
head also would be appointed by Trump.
Trump's taxes are being audited by the IRS, whose head Trump will <i>appoint.</i>
Trump also had just finished building a large hotel on land he 
<i>rents from the US government (GSA)</i> in Washington DC.
Trump will <i>appoint</i> the head of the GSA.
Diplomats from a large number of (essentially all?)
foreign countries are now supposedly 
making plans to lodge at that Trump hotel in an effort to bribe him.

Trump also has simply
directly held many presidency-related events
at Trump hotels and resorts, <i>billing</i> all attendees,
the Secret Service protecting him, etc, for their
attendance, which typically earns him
around $500K per event.
President-elect
Trump according to press reports (and a later ambiguous
<a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/801130374566998016">response</a>

British UKIP-leader
Nigel Farage about halting plans 
for a wind-energy farm near his 
Turnberry golf resort, because it would mar the view.
According to a 
report by prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata, 
Trump's first post-election phone call with his Argentine 
counterpart Mauricio Macri included urging the latter
to steamroll permit issues holding up construction 
of a new 
Trump-brand skyscraper in Buenos Aires.
Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report.

Rodrigo Duterte appointed Jose Antonio,
a longtime business associate of Trump's, as 
a "special envoy to the United States."

In December, Trump's main business partner Dogan
on the "Trump Towers"
project in Istanbul was <i>arrested</i> in an apparent
open-ended effort by Turkish President Erdogan to 
coerce Trump.
(Erdogan had earlier, in June, called for Trump's name to 
be removed from those towers.)
Trump <i>appoints</i> the heads of the agencies that 
investigate/regulate the banks he has huge loans from.
Setya Novanto
happened to be
standing next to Trump when Trump announced
on US television (1 Sept. 2016) from Trump Tower,
his signing of a "loyalty pledge" to the Republican Party.
At that announcement Trump described him to the cameras as 
"the Speaker of the House of Malaysia" and a "great man" 
who was there with "his whole group" to meet Trump to 
"do great things for the United States."  
However, what Trump neglected to mention was that Novanto
had been forced to resign as Speaker in December 2015
due to his part in an enormous corruption scandal 
attempting to extort Indonesia's largest taxpayer, 
U.S. mining giant Freeport, to pay him $4 <i>billion</i>
in bribes. (He was secretly recorded doing so.)
Also as part of the same or related scandals,
global investigators believe more 
than $1 billion entered Malaysian Prime Minister 
Najib Razak's personal bank accounts.
And, amazingly enough, the man Trump had touted throughout
his early campaign as his greatest friend and future US 
Treasury Secretary &ndash; Wall Street barracuda
Carl Icahn &ndash; was the <i>largest owner</i> 
of Freeport!
Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner &ndash; also the scion of
an ultra-wealthy New York City real estate family
(his father and business partner
Charles in 2005 was sentenced to two years prison for tax evasion,
witness tampering, and illegal campaign contributions) &ndash;
also has enormous but largely secret
financial entanglements with Russians and Chinese.

Trump, as one of the central facets of his campaign, pledged to build one of the largest

plus forcibly deport (with the aid of a new military "deportation force")
illegal immigrants estimated to number about 11 million, which
would be one of the largest forced migrations in human history:

Trump <i>never held a press conference</i> in 2016
after the one on 27 July where he'd urged Russia to hack Hillary's emails.
(Indeed his next one was 11 January 2017, about half a year later.)
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton failed to hold a press conference
throughout a 277-day span between 5 Dec. 2015
and 8 Sept. 2016, with the arguable possible exception of
taking some questions during a minorities conference on 5 August.
</li><li>
This may have been the first USA presidential election 
swung by "fake news."  Well... certainly, lies 
have, historically, often been circulated during campaigns.
But in the present case with the rise of the internet and "social media"
such as "FaceBook," the volume of "fake news" stories circulated became massive
to the point where they actually could overwhelm genuine news.
Many appeared to the eye to have been written by genuine reputable news
agencies such as ABC News (complete with official ABC News logo), etc.
But actually, ABC had nothing to do with it and the story was a complete fabrication.
An analysis by BuzzFeed
[Craig Silverman:
<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook">This Analysis Shows How Fake Election News Stories Outperformed Real News On Facebook</a>, 16 Nov. 2016]
showed that &ndash; stunningly &ndash;
FaceBook news feed's 
top 20 genuine news stories related to the election
were <i>outperformed</i> by its top 20 election-related fake news stories,
during the period from 1 August to Election day!
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was this enough to swing the election? Certainly.
First, Facebook claimed more than 1.65 billion monthly active users 
as of 31 March 2016, far exceeding the USA's electorate, and claimed
those 20 fake news stories got 8.7 million "shares,
reactions, and comments" as measured by FaceBook &ndash; the
plain readership 
(i.e. readers who just read it without "sharing" or "commenting")
presumably was larger.
Second, BuzzFeed found that
of these top 20 fake news stories,
<i>17 were overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton!</i>
That means, unquestionably, that they were the result of a conspiracy.
Third, consider how close the election was.  If less than 0.1% of
FaceBook users, <i>or</i> just 6% 
of those 8.7 million sharers, reactors, or commentors,
switched their vote to Trump due
to this, that would have been enough.
And keep in mind that FaceBook was only <i>one</i> fake-news venue.

This one seems a bit ominous.  According to a compilation by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_life_expectancy">wikipedia</a> <small>

Why did Nevada break the pattern?
Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that

<p>
Will Trump be a great president?  I don't know.  But all those 
simultaneous worst-ever
records are not a good start...  for most of them
<i>just that one</i>
would seem under normal circumstances to make him unacceptable as
President.
</p><p>
Incidentally, one could construct a (smaller) list of 
often-bad news about Hillary Clinton too.  
The most obvious superlative about Clinton is that
she if elected would have been the first female president
(no woman had ever been vice president either, for that matter).
</p><p>
After her husband Bill's presidential terms ended, the Clintons
claimed they were virtually broke, but then Hillary
made over $150 million from giving speeches 
to Wall Street firms for $200K to $700K per
speech (text of speeches kept secret and recording forbidden by 
special contract), while Bill got at least $17.6 million
for being "honorary chancellor" 2010-2015 of a chain of for-profit 
"Laureate universities"
(when their founder Doug Becker was asked
what Clinton <i>did</i> in that "job," he 
responded that he'd served as "an inspiration").
Bill Clinton also got huge payments for making speeches, e.g. in May 2012
earned $1.4 million
for a 7-day-long tour giving speeches to rich people's groups in Europe,
and in all earned over $100 million for giving speeches during 2001-2013,
most of it from foreign countries (many while his wife served 
as US Secretary of State 2009-2013).  
In contrast, the annual salary of 
the US president during 2001-2016 was $400K,
while the USA per capita income was about $40K,
so Hillary actually often earned more 
for a <i>single</i> speech to a Wall Street Firm,
than she would have gotten for an 
entire year's service as US president,
or 10 years earnings for an average citizen.
</p><p>
I don't know about you, but I simply cannot regard those as 
"perfectly normal legal economic transactions."  They are <i>vastly</i>
outside the norm.  The only way I can interpret them
is this: the vast majority of the Clintons' total fortune was acquired 
100% corruptly.  Considering a major problem faced by the 2016 USA
was its record or near-record high levels of
economic inequality, it did not seem wise to elect somebody 
that severely bought and paid for as the "cure."
Also, as Bernie Sanders' campaign (following, e.g, an expos&eacute; by the
<i>Washington Post</i>) 
<a href="assets/documents/Bernie-2016-Letter-to-DNC-1.pdf">pointed</a> out,
Clinton cheated about campaign finance laws, using shenanigans
resembling the game of "3-card monte" to effectively obtain
unlimited individual campaign donations despite 
legal limits on donation amounts.

<a name="surp"><h3> Was Trump's victory a "huge surprise"?  Not to me and some others. </h3></a>
<p>
Many in the media proclaimed that it was a "huge surprise" which "nobody predicted" 
when Trump won the Republican nomination, and then when he won the presidency,
they said it was the "biggest upset in living memory."
</p><p>
Really? 
</p><p>
Well, first of all, I myself publicly 
<a href="Trump2015.html">predicted</a>, back in July 2015, that
Trump should easily win the GOP nomination as a consequence of
"fame based failure" historically-confirmed plurality voting dynamics.
(Which, by the way, Trump himself may well have been fully aware of.
At least, he certainly acted like he was.)
So while it may be true that major media-approved pundits using their
usual no-evidence gut-based "methodologies," did
not predict this, it is false to claim "nobody" did.  
It is merely that the media was not interested
in what I had to say.
</p><p>
I further went on (back in July 2015) to predict
that 
</p><ol>
<li>
Sanders would be an underdog versus
Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination,
but would provide a tough battle to a fairly close finish.
</li><li>
Trump would then be an underdog versus Hillary Clinton in the general election, 
but still would have
a "puncher's chance" to win &ndash;
likely depending on scandals, i.e. which one got more
damaged by various possible  scandals breaking.
</li></ol>
All of those predictions by me turned out, 1.5 years later,
to be correct.
What I did <i>not</i> predict &ndash;
but could have if I'd been a bit cleverer &ndash;
was that Trump would, toward the end of the GOP primary battle,
encourage anti-Trump voters to stop voting for all 
kinds of possible Trump rivals, and instead focus on Cruz alone &ndash;
because in his view, Trump and Cruz were the only two left with
serious chances, and any other vote would therefore be "wasted."
(This went against Trump's successful strategy all along of
splitting the vote between all his rivals.)
</p><blockquote>
The reason that (I believe) Trump did that was: 
At that point, there was no longer any serious danger that Trump 
would not win the plurality of GOP delegates.  The main danger
was that he would fail to win a <i>majority</i>, and then all
the anti-Trump delegates might <i>unite</i> to nominate
somebody else to save us from Trump.  (There were, in fact, attempts
to organize exactly that, one of the ringleaders being the previous
GOP nominee Mitt Romney.)  If Cruz came in a strong second behind Trump,
then it would be difficult for that conspiracy to justify
choosing anybody besides Cruz; and as Trump well knew, the Republican Establishment 
<i>detested</i> Cruz.
</blockquote><p>
The second thing I did not see coming was the Trump sex-assault/videotape scandal.
Fortunately for Trump, Hillary Clinton and the DNC had countervailing email scandals
(which everybody did know was looming &ndash; Sanders had declined to exploit
it during the primary, but obviously the Republicans and FBI were not likely to
be that chivalrous) which happened to get
re-emphasized by the media during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the election.
</p><a name="preelpred"></a><p>
Numerous polls in the timespan leading up to the election usually had
Clinton ahead of Trump, and consequently poll-aggregators such
as HuffPost Pollster and
RealClearPolitics.com
predicted (correctly) that Clinton would win the national popular vote, by
(respectively) 5.3% and 3.3% margins.
Actually, she won by a 2% margin.
Given that these two aggregators differed by 2, one might
expect each of their predictions to exhibit standard error
of about &plusmn;2, in which case the actual margin was not 
outrageously off target.
</p><p>
But the <i>electoral</i> vote was what officially mattered, and
that is less trivial to predict &ndash; statewide, not nationwide, polls are
needed, and the individual state-predictions need to
be combined, e.g. using "Monte Carlo" computerized methodology. 
The well known prediction agency "five-thirty-eight" run by
statistician Nate Silver thus predicted (the day before the election)
a 71.4% chance that Clinton would win, versus 28.6% chance for Trump.
Meanwhile the PredictWise "prediction market" forecast 89% chance for Clinton.
In view of that, it perhaps was a "surprise" that Trump won, but hardly a huge one.
The amount of surprise was comparable to: if you roll a 6-sided die,
and the result is "1" as opposed to a member of {2,3,4,5,6}.
I've performed this experiment, often with result=1, many times in my life and its 
"surprise" value wore off long ago.
</p><p>
So I am not at all impressed by the media's expression of huge surprise.
</p>
<a name="Lichtman">
<h3> And now for something completely different: Lichtman's "13 keys"
to the white house</h3></a>
<p>
History professor Allan J. Lichtman (American University)
in the <i>Washington Post</i>
on 23 September 2016, publicly 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/23/trump-is-headed-for-a-win-says-professor-whos-predicted-30-years-of-presidential-outcomes-correctly/"
>predicted</a> 
Trump would win the presidency. This was based on 13
particular yes/no 
<a href="LichtmanKeys?%3F">questions</a>, which he called for short, the  "keys."
The 13 keys were devised by Lichtman
in collaboration with  Russian scientist Volodia Keilis-Borok in 1981.
To use them, you simply answer the 13 questions, and
if more than half the keys are true, then the incumbent party is predicted to
retain power, while if more than half are false, the challenging party
will win the White House.
Lichtman told the Washington Post that this method had successfully predicted all
8 presidential elections between 1983 and 2013 &ndash; and now with 2016
added, that makes 9.
</p><p>
The interesting thing about Lichtman's "13 keys" method is that his 13
questions only concern the <i>historical circumstances surrounding</i> the election, not
the election itself.  It, roughly speaking,
does not care who the candidates are, what they say, 
and what their poll numbers are.  For that reason it often is possible to produce
their prediction years ahead of time.  In particular: if the Republican nominee
had not been "Donald Trump," but rather "Porky the Pig" &ndash; 
and Porky was polling only 1% &ndash; Lichtman's prediction would remain unaffected!
</p><p>
As an perhaps-unspoken
corollary, Lichtman is telling us that <i>voters are complete morons</i>!
They are wholy predictable robots.  
They do not even <i>look</i> at what the candidates
are saying, what they will do once elected,
what their records are, etc.  They simply mindlessly 
choose the party appropriate for that historical moment, and elect its nominee.
</p><p>
<small>
More precisely: some voters might not be morons.  But 
that is <i>irrelevant</i> &ndash; the 
same election results arise, as if they all were.
</small></p><p>
But before you get too enthralled with the Lichtman "13 keys" method, we 
must warn you that there are three reasons
things are less rosy for Lichtman than we just
made it sound.  First, many of his keys are <i>not</i>
completely objective yes/no questions.
They depend on evaluations of such subjective words as
"serious,"
"significant,"
"economic recession,"
"charismatic," "hero," "failure," "scandal," "major changes," 
"sustained social unrest,"
and "success."
That leaves Lichtman a lot of "wiggle room"
to use to pretend his predictions were "successful."
And indeed, Nate Silver attempted in 2011 to redo the Lichtman-keys 
calculations independently himself, using his own subjective judgments
where necessary &ndash; with his conclusion being
that they actually <i>mis</i>predicted the 1992
election.  Silver also disagreed with Lichtman about a couple of
other "keys" predictions during 1860-1980, and guesstimates that the method 
really will be about 80% accurate.
</p><p>
Second, since his system predicted Gore would win in 2000 &ndash;
oops, actually Bush did &ndash; Lichtman then qualified by saying his predictions
pertained to the <i>popular vote</i> winner (who <i>was</i> Gore)
not the <i>official</i> (electoral-vote-based) winner.  The trouble with that is,
in 2016, Hillary Clinton was the popular-vote winner, while Trump won only
due to the machinations of the electoral college. Oops again.
</p><p>
Finally third, and probably most importantly,
let me express a certain amount of skepticism re voodoo.
Specifically,
<b>here is how to pretend to be a presidential-prediction genius.</b>
Begin by constructing a set of 10
binary questions whose answers seem coin-toss-like,
i.e. essentially totally random and independent, although actually wholy 
deterministic.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Examples:</b><ul><li>
Did the challenging-party's candidate (when young) have brown hair?
<!-- </li><li> Is his age over 55 years? -->
</li><li> Does he fart more than the median person? 
</li><li> Was he born on an odd-numbered day of the year?
</li><li> Is his eye-color blue/hazel, or other?
</li><li> Toenails longer than median person?
</li><li> Is the moon brighter than median?
</li><ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
You get the idea.
</p><p>
Note, unlike Lichtman, my questions are totally objective &ndash; I'm not going to
(in cowardly fashion) allow <i>any</i> "wiggle room"!  Also, I'm not going
to weasel about "popular vote"; I'm going to predict the official winner!
And all my questions are going to be <i>completely</i> unrelated to history, 
voter thinking, polls, candidate statements, etc,
i.e. my model's voters <i>truly</i>, beyond any shadow of a doubt,
are effectively total moron-robots.
And to put the icing on the cake, I am not going to need 13 questions. I'm only going
to need 5, because I'm way more of a genius than Lichtman &ndash; i.e. my questions are
way more insightful than his, in some deep mysterious way not at all apparent
to anybody reading them.
</p><p>
<b>Theorem:</b> 
Among 10 such questions, it is likely that there exists a
5-element subset of them, and a labeling of each of
their answers as "positive" or
"negative," such that the presidency, the last 9 times in a row, was predicted
correctly every time, by "were the majority among the 5 question-answers positive?"
(And if such a test exists, then
one can find it, i.e. 
find <i>which</i> subset and which labeling, by computer exploration
of all possibilities.)
</p><p>
<b>Proof:</b>
The number of 5-element question-subsets is 10!/5!<sup>2</sup>=252.
The number of ways to sign-label those 5 questions is 2<sup>5</sup>=32.
So, in all, the computer explores 252&times;32=8064 possible tests.
Each possible test has a <nobr>2<sup>-9</sup>=1/512</nobr> chance of successfully predicting
all 9 binary-choice presidencies in a row. 
So therefore the expected number of 100%-successful tests is 8064/512=15.75.
With almost 16 working tests expected to be found by my computer, 
it is likely that &ge;1 exists.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p><small>
Actually, the use of the undefined word "likely" means our
"theorem" is not really a theorem.  Real
theorems must be completely unambiguous.
But we think this is good enough to make our point.
</small>
</p><p>
(And to make it <i>very</i> likely this ploy will work,
instead select the best
7-question subset among 14 such questions, not 5 from 10.)
</p><p>
The moral of this little math-exercise is: 
Beware statistical humbug!
This sort of thing is a standard scam
for astounding the gullible with your "genius" and the "immense insight"
of your "amazing system."  In reality, 
it may not necessarily tell us anything useful.
</p><p>
I do not know the whole story of the "13 keys" method so I am 
not willing to claim it necessarily is total garbage. I just recommend caution.
Also, if it really is as effective as Lichtman claims, that is a frightening thing
and seems to imply that democracy is virtually pointless.

We want to assess who would have won the presidency if all major primary contenders 
had run together in a nationwide election conducted with
approval (or score) voting.   To do that, we collect polls  that (1)
employed those voting systems, and (2) enquired about these candidates.
Such polls of course only happened during the "primaries."
Primary voting in different US states, took place from 1 February to 14 June 2016.
Therefore, perhaps polls during the middle of this period,
i.e. April, seem the most relevant.
The following table summarizes approval-style polls
sampling over 1000 people each (nationwide adult) taken
from February to July.  The candidates are listed
in descending order of fav/unfav ratio.

As you can see, Sanders would have won the election if
approval voting had been used and the election had been held 
during the primaries period.   
</p><a name="SandersKasichPair"></a><p>
<b>What about Kasich</b>, who came the closest
to Sanders in approval?  
In the 12 <b>pairwise Sanders-vs-Kasich polls</b> compiled by
<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_kasich_vs_sanders-5817.html#polls#polls">RealClearPolitics.com</a>
during March, April, and May 2016, Sanders won 9 and Kasich 3 of them.
Kasich's largest margin of
victory was 44-41 and Sanders' largest 52-41.
Also Sanders won the final 7 among these 12.
So I think Sanders' chances would have been about 80% in a head-to-head race versus Kasich.
</p><p>
It is perhaps worth reiterating that both Clinton &amp; Trump were
the least-approved major party US presidential nominees in the history
of approval-style polling.   This is not a close call.
</p><p>
<b>The absurdly anti-democratic nature of US primaries.</b>
It also is worth noting that
Trump got 14.0M votes in the Republican primaries, and Clinton 16.85M
in the Democratic primaries, i.e. together 30.9 million votes.
This is <b>9.6%</b> of the USA's estimated 319.9M population,
and an extremely unrepresentative 9.6% too.

</p><p>
The main reasons Clinton's lead  widens with approval versus
the official <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting margin,
presumably are
</p><ol type="A"><li>
Because of the elimination or reduction of the

<p>
It also is worth noting that Hillary Clinton's
low approval ratings are of recent vintage,
as we see in this graphic from Gallup:
</p>
<img src="assets/images/HRC-Gallup.png">
<p>
In contrast, Trump actually appears to have gradually become <i>less</i>
disapproved over the 1.5 years preceding the election, moving from about 23/62 
Fav/Unfav rating in early July 2015, to about 37/58 in late Nov. 2016.
</p><p>
Note also that <i>every</i> candidate, unfortunately, was
more disapproved than approved.
But oddly enough the outgoing president Barack <b>Obama</b>
(forbidden by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">22nd amendment</a>
from seeking a 3rd consecutive term) enjoyed majority approval at this same time, 
i.e. would have won re-election by landslide (if that were legal
and he'd been added to
this slate of candidates; see bottom row of table, shaded blue).
Indeed, at the end of his second term,
Obama enjoyed 55/41 fav/unfav rating.
</p><p>
Also note, that Clinton's approval lead that we have assessed 
was <i>on election day</i> 8 Nov.
In contrast, in mid-September, the same methodologies concluded that
<a href="TruthApp.html#GaryJohnson">Johnson</a>
led approval-style polling.

Here are the results of a
Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald nationwide poll 
conducted by RKM Research, 31 August to 4 September, 2016. 
The survey is based on responses from
1025 randomly selected likely voters via
interviews conducted by landline and cellular
telephone. The scale is
VU=very unfavorable=0,
SU=somewhat unfavorable=1,
SF=somewhat favorable=2,
VF=somewhat favorable=3,
with the numbers {0,1,2,3} not told to the pollees but
used by us to compute average scores.
The table entries say the percentage of respondents who chose each score for
the candidate in that row.  (Row sums less than 100 because
of "don't know" responses, not shown.)
Besides the 4 candidates, they <i>also</i> included in their poll
Bernie Sanders (whose run ended after his defeat by Clinton
in the Democratic party primary),
Elizabeth Warren (who never ran, but had often been mentioned 
as a possible Dem-party contender) and Bill Weld (who 
also did not run for President
but was Johnson's vice presidential running mate).
Their table lines are shaded green and blue.

You may object that polls held in <i>September</i> were too early.
Fortunately for you, the 
FPU/Boston Herald/RKM nationwide poll 
was <a href="assets/documents/FPU-BH-Tables-110616.pdf">redone</a> 
on 1-5 November (1009 random likely voters nationwide;
landline &amp; cellphone), and it turns out the "too early"
criticism indeed carries weight, because 
during the two months
between these two FPU/BH/RKM polls,
things changed!
Most prominently, Johnson's unfavorables rose.
Here are this poll's results:
</p>
<table>
<tr bgcolor="pink"><th>Candidate</th>

<p>
Incredibly, the <b>ordering-by-average-score
of the 4 candidates has <i>reversed</i></b>
versus the earlier Aug-Sept poll by the same pollster using the same methodology!
(And although Trump "won" this poll, actually both he and Clinton 
are co-winners in the sense that their difference lies within its
statistical margin of error. Also note, this poll's ordering is confirmed,
except for Stein, by the preceding Bloomberg/Selzer poll.)

Finally, a post-election 
<a href="assets/documents/PewNov2016postElPoll.pdf">poll</a> (10-14 Nov. 2016, interviewed
1254 registered voters aged over 18 who said they had voted, telephone both
landline and cell)
by Pew Research Institute
asked voters to "grade" the candidates A,B,C,D,F.
Only 30% gave Trump either an A or B,
the lowest percentage among  winning 
candidates in every US presidential election 1988-2016,
and also lowest &ndash; but tied with G.H.W.Bush in 1992
&ndash; among second-place candidates in those years.
(Note, 43% gave Clinton an A or B, and a higher average,
marking the only time 1988-2016
that the loser actually outperformed the winner on Pew's grading question.)

<h3> Suicide-level idiocy of both the Republican and Democratic (and Green!) parties 
</h3></a>

<p>
During the primaries, there were many "pairwise polls" attempting to assess
who would win, X or Y, in a head-to-head X-versus-Y race.  (For almost
all of them, X was a Democrat and Y a Republican.)
These polls indicated that in a Clinton-versus-Y race, 
or Sanders-versus-Y race,
Trump was one of the <i>worst possible</i> choices for the Republican Y,
i.e. one of the least likely to win that pairwise battle.
They also indicated that in a X-versus-Trump race, Sanders clearly
outperformed Clinton.  There also was a round-robin poll 
by GfK for the Center for Election Science (sample&gt;1000)
indicating Sanders actually would have defeated every one of 8 
rivals pairwise. (Unfortunately the 8 "rivals" they
assessed did not include John Kasich, 
but did include Michael Bloomberg, 
who decided not to run. But when we found 12 other pairwise
Sanders-Kasich polls <a href="#SandersKasichPair">ourselves</a>
they suggested Sanders would 
have won that pairing too):
</p>
<a href="assets/images/CES2016honestPairwise.png"><img src="assets/images/CES2016honestPairwise.png" alt="honest opinions pairwise table by CES 2016"></a>
<p>
So the Democrats were <i>suicidally stupid</i> to nominate Clinton, who lost,
as opposed to Sanders, who would have won.  Meaning they were suicidally stupid
to
</p><ol type="A"><li>
Employ  <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting;
</li><li>
Usually demand only registered Democrats vote in their primary,
refusing to permit either Independents and Other-Party members to vote;
</li><li>
Even in "open primary" states, or states where Independents were legally permitted
to vote in the Democratic primary, the Democratic party (in at least some cases)
corruptly discouraged this and tried to keep it quiet.
</li></ol>
<p>
Because: if the Democrats had instead employed
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> or 
score voting for their
primaries, and permitted Independents to vote in them
(or merely the latter alone),
then Sanders would have won their nomination, and then the Presidency.
And further, this also
would cause the Democrats to nominate candidates more likely to win
the presidency, <i>every</i> time, not just in 2016.
</p><p>
Also: The Democratic nomination hinged on the "superdelegates,"
who were non-democratically chosen.  Almost all superdelegates chose Clinton. If,
instead, almost all had chosen Sanders, then it is a mathematical fact
that he would have been nominated, and then a 
polls-and-election-results-based
fact that he thereupon would have won the presidency.  
The latter is essentially certain based on the gap between Clinton and Sanders in
X-versus-Trump pairwise polls, versus the small official
Trump-Clinton margins in
the three crucial states of MI, WI, and PA.
</p><p>
The Sanders team had in fact pointed out
the X-versus-Trump pairwise poll evidence in an unsuccessful attempt to
get the superdelegates to switch.   And Sanders was entirely correct in
this argument.  The reason he failed to convince the superdelegates of this
convincing and correct argument was presumably that the superdelegate system
is massively corrupt &ndash; based on political favors, money transfers,
and influence peddling, and <i>not</i> on poll-based realities about what is
best for the Party (which is the alleged raison d'etre for the superdelegate system).
Clinton had had 20 years as a top Democrat to suck up to superdelegates.
But Sanders had only become a Democrat (previously Independent)
for his 2016 presidential run,
and therefore could not compete in this sleaze-battle.

</p><blockquote>
Results from the exit polls conducted in 27 states through the 
nominating contest so far show that Hillary Clinton has 
established a huge lead over Sanders among voters who self-identify
as Democrats. Sanders, though trailing in the popular vote and 
delegate count, has remained competitive only because he has

self-identify as independents.

<p>
Support among <i>both</i> Democrats and Independents (and everybody else)
is what matters both for benefitting the country,
and also for the chances of winning the general election.
Our point is that
Sanders was preferred within this combined set because Independents
outnumbered Registered Democrats; and the Democratic party was,
in this election, suicidally stupid
to try to discourage/stop Independents from voting in their primaries.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the Republicans 
were <i>suicidally stupid</i> to nominate Trump, who had among the worst chances
versus Democrat X, as opposed to almost anybody else, who had better chances.  
Trump won that nomination solely due to the 
<a href=""Trump2015.html">fame-based failure</a> pathology of plurality voting,
which made the Republicans look like utter jackasses once again.   They would
have avoided this problem with approval or score voting. Then Trump would
<i>not</i> have won their nomination.  And this
would give the Republicans better chances to win the presidency
not just in 2016, but every time.

<b>NBC/WSJ:</b> NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll conducted by Hart Research Associates and Public
Opinion Strategies. Dates 14-16 Feb 2016 (400 sampled), and 3-6 March (397 sampled).
<b>ABC/WP:</b> ABC News/Washington Post Poll 3-6 March 2016, asked of 
400 registered voters nationwide who are Republicans or lean Republican:
"What if the choice was just between Trump and Cruz? Who would you like to 
see win?" If unsure: "Who do you lean toward?" 
The two numbers sum to less than 100, such as 57+40=97, because of "don't know" voters.

<p>
These polls make it clear that Trump indeed won the Republican nomination solely
as the result of the
&quot;<a href=""Trump2015.html">fame-based failure</a>&quot; pathology of plurality voting
&ndash;
i.e, his rivals split the vote.  If pitted against any of these three rivals
head-to-head, Trump would have lost.
(The only poll disagreeing with this conclusion is the italicized Kasich:Trump
poll in February, won by Trump; but it is outweighed by the March re-poll with larger
and opposed conclusion.)
</p><p>
In case you were wondering, the Democratic primary also was severely
distorted by its plurality-style voting. Consider Martin O'Malley,
the only life-long Democrat in the Democratic field (and past chair
of the "Democratic Leadership Council"). He was mayor
of Baltimore, two-term governor of Maryland,
and notched several progressive achievements, including 
passing legislation legalizing same-sex marriage and outlawing the death penalty.
Why was all that only worth about 1% in national polls, causing O'Malley to drop
out of the Democratic race in frustration after getting 1% in
the Iowa Caucuses on 1 Feb? 
Obviously, this again was a huge distortion caused purely by "must vote for one
of the top 2 leaders" strategic imperatives with 
<a href="plurality.html">plurality</a> voting (the "top two most-likely-to-win"
rapidly coalesced as being Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton) 
and had little to do with O'Malley's true level of support.

</p><p>
Why? Because in this particular election there is no question
whatever that IRV would not have altered the election result.
And more generally, IRV would <a href="AustralianPol.html#indep2">not</a> 
get rid of the USA's
2-party domination that has prevented the Green party from
ever winning even a single federal seat ever.
The Australian Green party actually did have one of its
members win a federal House seat in <i>Australia</i> via
a standard IRV election (Australia elects its House with IRV).
I repeat, <i>one</i>.  His name is Adam Bandt.  He was
the only third-party member ever to win an Australian House seat 
in a standard IRV election during 1950-2015.
This perhaps is why the Australian Green Party calls for the
abolition of IRV for electing its House.
And why the Australian public as a whole (in polls) keeps saying
they would abolish IRV for electing its House,
if given the chance in a referendum.
</p><p>
The USA Greens, were they not this awe-inspiringly stupid, 
would advocate score or approval voting.

<b>Plurality voting:</b>
Clinton won the nationwide popular vote by about 2% over Trump.
But Trump won the presidency thanks to the "electoral college."
</p><p>
In the below considerations about non-plurality voting systems,
we will speak only of popular vote &ndash; except that in the case of IRV
what we say is true regardless of whether electoral or popular is used.
</p>

<p>
<b>Score voting (restricted to the four final party-nominees
Clinton, Trump,  Johnson, and Stein only):</b>
The outcome is very unclear. 
All three &ndash; Clinton, Trump and Johnson &ndash;
led, depending what time the poll was taken during the final 2 months
(plus the 1 week immediately after election day)
and perhaps Stein also could have won.
However, it appears any one of 
</p><center>
Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama, Paul Ryan
</center><p>
(listed in approximately descending order) would have (if they too had run) 
easily defeated all four of these.
</p>

<p>
<b>Approval voting (restricted to those four):</b>
Hillary Clinton wins.
<!-- (and apparently by a larger margin than her official win,
apparently enough to make her win electoral-college-proof?) -->
But again
if Obama had been allowed to run
(or if Sanders or Kasich had continued to run), 
either would again have easily defeated all four.
Also Johnson led back in mid-September, as opposed to on
election day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Instant Runoff voting (restricted to those four):</b>
The electoral and popular 
results would have been the same as with
the official plurality-based system(s).
</p><a name="IRVfavbet"></a><p>
Incidentally, the CES/GfK 
<a href="https://electology.org/blog/honest-voters-had-preference-2016">poll</a> 
found that instant runoff exhibited a 
<b>7.7%</b>
"favorite betrayal" rate, i.e. 7.7% of their sample of over 1000 (polled
about a <i>9</i>-candidate field) said that they, if using
instant runoff voting, would have chosen to dishonestly rank their
true favorite below top.  This actually was a <i>greater</i>
favorite-betrayal rate than the 
7.3% that this same poll 
found for plain-plurality voting, contradicting common 
claims by IRV-proponents (those claims unfortunately are
usually made with zero supporting evidence)
that IRV would cause greater voter honesty and
less strategic lying than plain plurality voting.
</p>

<p>
<b>Approval Voting (all primary contenders, all parties):</b>
Sanders would have won, with Kasich second.
Oddly(?) enough, these also were the two candidates with the
greatest <a href="TruthApp.html">truthfulness</a> percentages according
to fact-checking agencies; and also Kasich would seem to have
been the most-qualified Republican.
</p>

<p>
<b>Score Voting (all primary contenders, all parties):</b>
Either Sanders or Kasich would have won.
</p>

<p>
<b>Instant Runoff Voting (all primary contenders, all parties):</b>
It would have been utterly absurd to try to get voters to rank-order about 25 candidates.
For this reason, no reputable pollster conducted an IRV-style poll 
(and probably none ever will in any comparable circumstance).
There were, however, a few "second choice" polls and based on them we can
<a href="Trump2015.html">try</a>, somewhat dubiously,
to estimate the IRV winner; e.g. probably the Republican nominee with
IRV would have been either Walker or Trump, and the Democrat still
would have been Clinton.
</p>

<p><b>Suicidal Idiocy Tally:</b>
Both the Democratic and Republican parties were foolish
to use the voting systems they did, since each would have assured winning
the  presidency by switching their primary to use approval voting
with Independents allowed to vote too.
The Green party foolishly advocated Instant Runoff Voting which
would not have altered the winner and would
not help US third parties; but with score voting Gary Johnson 
actually might have won the 2016 presidency.
</p>

<p><b>Partial Damage Tally:</b>
Trump was (simultaneously) the uniquely least qualified, lyingest, 
most financially interest-conflicted, oldest, 
most insanely litigious,
most divorced, least-approved, 
most newspaper-opposed, and most-massively-bankrupt 
US president in the history of record keeping for each of
these categories.
He promised he'd militarily force one of the largest  migrations in human history.
And over 20 women publicly accused him of sexual assault.
