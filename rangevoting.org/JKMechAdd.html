<H2> Mechanical Addition </H2>

<p><small>By Jan Kok</small></p>
<p>
There are a zillion ways to add numbers <i>mechanically</i>, display the
result, and constrain the result to a desired range.
</p>
<p>
The voters can each select one of 11 (for 0-10 Range-Voting) punches or markers
to unambiguously punch or mark the addend ballots.
</p>
<p>
<!--
I suggest using 0-10 as the RV range. It makes the arithmetic slightly
easier than 0-9 or 0-99. The mechanical adding machine referred to
above could compute A+B+C-10=score (in 0-10 range). The point is to
make the scheme slightly easier to explain and understand by ordinary
people. 
-->
Note that it's a long way from "here" (these discussions and
papers) to "there" (implementation in real life, when we can revisit
the question of which range to use).
