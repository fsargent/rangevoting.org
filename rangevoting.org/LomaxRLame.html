As I read this, Richie is arguing that
his three criteria are necessary for "political viability" of an election
system. 
It is not entirely clear what this means. 
"Political viability" is something that can vary drastically with the state of
understanding of the electorate and other players (such as media).
It's not a trait of election systems, per se. 
However, certainly, election systems can have characteristics which affect political
viability <i>under certain conditions.</i> Let's see if we can find some
of that here:

<blockquote>
<b>Richie's Criterion 1:</b> 
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of
majority rule? In an election with two candidates, the candidate
preferred by a majority should always win."
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Now, Richie is claiming that IRV satisfies this while
Range and Approval do not. However, in a two-candidate election,
Range and Approval both satisfy this criterion (with Range, a
qualification must be added). Where's the beef?
</p><p>
Approval satisfies this criterion. Range, however,
allows voters to cast weak votes. A clear way of looking at this is
to consider a Range election with a 10-point scale
to be an Approval election, only every voter
gets up to ten votes to cast for each candidate. 
It is as if the
voter (every voter) is ten voters, each with one vote. If a majority
of the <i>total</i> voters (i.e., the number of actual voters multiplied
by ten) vote a preference for a candidate, that candidate cannot fail
to win. Range essentially allows voters an additional degree of
freedom. Voters may indeed exercise this freedom in such a way as to
cause their preference to be more weakly considered, and thus the
"preference of the majority" can fail to win &ndash; but only if the voters
<i>allow</i> this to happen.
</p><p>
The alleged failure of the Majority Criterion by Range and Approval
only comes <i>legitimately</i> into play when there are <i>more</i> than two
candidates. 
And it is clear that Approval, especially, violates the
Majority Criterion only in a technical sense, because, with Approval,
more than one candidate may win a majority of votes. Once again,
Approval <i>allows</i> voters to express something more sophisticated than
a simple preference. 
This freedom allows them collectively to pass
over a candidate who is the first choice of a majority in favor of a
candidate who is <i>equally</i> chosen by <i>more</i> than that majority. 
By assuming that enough of these voters, the ones who approved the
winner, actually preferred the other candidate, one may claim that
the first preference of a majority failed to win. 
However, the failure only happens if that majority <i>allows</i> it to happen. 
If they solely vote
their top preference, that preference cannot fail to win.
</p><p>
Thus Range and Approval, in substance, satisfy the <i>intention</i> of the
majority criterion, which is majority rule. 
A majority has absolute
<i>control</i> over the outcome of any of these election methods.
Someone other than the first preference of a majority can win only if there
is no majority which strictly expresses that. 
And no method can
guarantee a winner based on information not expressed by the voters!
</p><p>
As to "political viability," the basis of the claim would presumably
be that simply mentioning that a majority preference can fail to win
will blow everybody's minds and kill the whole idea. 
Yet it is easy to show that the "majority
preference" can, in any multiple choice decision being made by a
group of people, easily fail to be the best winner. 
I give the <a href="MajCrit.html#pizza">pizza example</a>, 
and it is often rejected by people on the basis that
candidates aren't pizzas. 
Brilliant argument! 
Of course, "pizza" is
just a generic object of choice. 
Are candidates an object of choice?
</p><p>
Anyway, the argument goes, a group of people, let's say there are
three of them to make it very simple, want to buy a pizza and split it. 
The pizza parlor, quixotically, will only allow them to choose
one kind of pizza. 
Two of the three prefer pepperoni, but the third
is an observant Jew, and cannot eat pepperoni, but, we'll say, would
have no problem with cheese or any vegetarian pizza. 
Now, if, for
some reason, the two pepperoni fans <i>must</i> have their pepperoni, they
certainly can get it. 
They might have some problems, though. 
The Jew
might balk at paying for it! 
Suppose that the pepperoni fans, though,
can agree that a mushroom pizza would be just fine, almost as good as
pepperoni. 
And that just happens to be the favorite of the Jew.
</p><p>
Please give a cogent argument why the first preference of the
majority should win.
</p><p>
Sure, politicians aren't pizzas. 
Rather, they are more important.
Please give a cogent reason why this argument breaks down with
important things. 
I'd argue, in fact, that it becomes more crucial
with important things. 
The "preference of a majority" can cause a
civil war, if it neglects the needs of a minority.
</p><p>
Absolutely, the majority has the right of decision; any other
position reduces to minority rule under some conditions. 
But that
right should be quite carefully exercised, and Approval and Range
methods preserve the right of the majority to decide, while allowing
it more sophistication in allowing something other than first
preference of the majority to win under some conditions &ndash; essentially,
only if the majority consents.
</p><p>
This consent can be made explicit, by the way,
in which case, the
Majority Criterion holds absolutely.
<blockquote>
<b>Richie's Criterion 2:</b> 
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of
requiring a minimum level of core support? A winner should be at
least one voter's first choice."
</blockquote>
</p><p>
This seems to be a made-up criterion, and largely irrelevant. Does
the first choice of one voter really matter if there are ten million
voters? 
Should a candidate win or fail because of one vote, of this kind? 
I.e, say there is a Range election and there is a very clear
range winner with a rating of, say, 80%, with the closest behind having,
say, 40%. 
Yet, for some very odd reason, nobody rated that winner as
the highest. Not even his mother. 
So we should choose a clearly
inferior candidate, according to the collective judgement, because
the guy's mother was irritated with him that day?
</p><p>
The criterion is just plain silly, because in any real election, it
is going to be satisfied. Period. 
One might consider it odd that this
argument, which depends on setting up a totally unrealistic election
scenario to make any sense, is advanced for IRV, when the same IRV
proponents criticize arguments against IRV based on theoretical
scenarios far more likely to actually take place than this one, as
rejectable because "they are only theoretical."
But I don't consider it odd at all:
This is the argumentation style of the desperate, those who
simply want to think of everything and the kitchen sink that they can throw.
</p><p>
In the pizza example (obviously I prefer talking about pizzas to
talking about politicians), suppose Mushroom was <i>not</i> the first
preference of the Jew. 
Should therefore pepperoni win? 
No, the second
choice of the majority, provided that it was also acceptable to the
Jew, should win. 
Or possibly some other mutually acceptable choice.
And if there was no mutually acceptable choice, <i>then</i> the majority
might make whatever choice it wants in a difficult situation. 
If the
Jew isn't going to eat any pizza acceptable to the majority, then the
majority might as well have its pepperoni. 
And this all is exactly what
would happen with <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range</a> and <a href="Approval.html">Approval</a>
voting.
</p><p>
<a href="Approval.html">Approval</a>-voting
elections aim at unanimity, in fact, and I've seen it work
that way in a highly polarized situation, with people expressing what
seemed to be tenacious preferences (more like demands, actually).
What, I wonder, does "United" mean in "United States?" Does it mean
"coerced to remain subject to the first preference of the majority &ndash;
or plurality?" Yes, too often it has and does mean that. 
But this is
hardly preferable to <i>true</i> unity, and it is true unity which is truly powerful.
</p><p>
Approval is a very simple change: "Just Count All the Votes!"
It does
not require ballot or counting system changes. It does not preclude
further changes, such as adding ranks (Condorcet or other ranked
methods including ones of the same nature as IRV) 
or ratings (Range). 
It simply solves the immediate spoiler
effect problem. 
It would not change everything radically. 
The
two-party system would not suddenly collapse. 
Most voters would still
vote for one candidate; the only effect, really, is that supporters
of a third party can both express support for that party while still
participating in the true pairwise election, thus the spoiler effect
is largely gone, and without a complicated ballot, without complicated
and defective rules, the kind that allows so many nightmare scenarios
to be generated with IRV, <i>just by striking out a few words in the
election code</i> &ndash; the ones which disenfranchise any voter who dares to
vote for more than one. 
Only one vote from
this voter gets counted (in the end) to create a winner, at most (just like IRV);
overvotes are <i>not</i> unfair.
</p><p>
That CVD does not get behind Approval Voting as, at least, a simple
option, shows me that CVD is not interested in true reform, it is
interested in one specific cause that it has allowed itself to be
nailed to. 
Absolutely, Approval isn't perfect. 
But it is a <i>huge</i>
improvement with practically no cost. 
Any reformer whose goal wasn't
political, that is, with a goal that was not about personal position
and influence, would see this.
<blockquote>
<b>Richie's Criterion 3:</b> 
"Does the system meet the common sense principle of
rewards for sincere voting? A voter should not likely be punished
for voting sincerely under the system's rules."
</blockquote>
</p><p>
And, of course, Range and Approval satisfy this, and IRV does not.
But that's not what you will hear from Richie. 
Instead you will hear
that "sincere Range voters" can be, allegedly, "punished" for voting
sincerely, allowing the exaggerating strict preference voters &ndash; called
"strategic" voters &ndash; to win. But what he won't mention is that this
can only happen if these sincere voters <i>allow</i> it to happen, that
is, they are <i>willing</i> to accept the choice of the strategic voters.
IRV, on the other hand, can actually require that voters <i>reverse</i>
their sincere preferences in order to gain an acceptable outcome,
which is a far worse violation of Criterion 3 than what we've just discussed
about Range or Approval.
</p><p>
But, note, the subjective word "likely" has been inserted into Criterion 3 by
Richie. 
This is why biased people should not be allowed to write
"voting method criteria." 
He's designed the Criterion to fit his
argument, which would then be that IRV is not "likely" to punish a
sincere voter. 
And that is very far from clear. 
Quite simply,
"likely" is an undefined term, and you don't use undefined terms to
create clear criteria. 
From what we have seen, IRV would fail what is
generally called Favorite Betrayal under reasonably likely
conditions, certainly more than a few percent of elections.
</p><p>
Richie will claim "harm" or "punishment" to sincere voters under
Range or Approval, when, in fact, these voters, if in the majority,
gain an <i>acceptable</i> winner, something which cannot be guaranteed under
IRV. I don't consider that harm at all, it is gain and benefit.
</p><p>
Yes, lame arguments.
</p><p>
Are these arguments nevertheless valid from the point of view of
"political viability?" Criterion One has some shot at it. The
"majority" argument will surely be used against Range or Approval,
though with Approval, there is clear precedent for considering that
it won't. 
Approval is essentially used already in public elections
when there are two conflicting referenda. 
The rule is that if both
pass (i.e., both have a majority of Yes votes vs. No votes), then the
referendum with the most Yes votes wins and is implemented. 
This is, precisely, Approval Voting. 
And it is quite possible that the other
referendum was the first choice of a majority, if they had been
presented as a choice. 
If Richie were correct, surely this "failure"
would have been eliminated as unjust.
</p><p>
Besides, people do understand about buying pizzas. They are not as
stupid as Richie thinks.
</p><p>
As to Criterion two, it is so totally lame that few voters would be
swayed by it. Sure, it sounds reasonable, like a lot of things that
can sound reasonable when first heard. 
I mean, do you really think
that anyone <i>could</i> win an election without being the first choice of
at least one person? 
Let's put it this way: we could run elections
until the sun grows cold and not see a large election, whether by IRV
or Range or Approval, that does not satisfy this criterion.
</p><p>
And Criterion Three, people have tolerated total violation of this
one for so long that I don't think it would prevent them from
continuing to tolerate it in greatly reduced effect.
</p><p>
If Richie is arguing <i>relative</i> political viability, and claiming
that people will choose IRV over Range or Approval, maybe he is
right. But that argument doesn't make sense in context. It would
reduce to "My method is Bigger than your method, so give up!" The
<i>legitimate</i> political viability argument would be "Your method, if
presented alone to the electorate, would be rejected because it
violates that criterion."
</p><p>
And this is obviously nonsense, given that rejecting an Approval
initiative, for example, would mean continuing to tolerate egregious
violation of that Criterion. Voting for your favorite, if it happens to
be, say, Nader or Badnarik, causes you to be as severely punished as possible
under present conditions: your vote is thereby totally discarded.
Approval would completely stop this.  Your participation in the major
contest becomes an option you can exercise without betraying your favorite.
