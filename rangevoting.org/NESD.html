<h1> A theory of 2-party domination </h1>
<h2> "NESD" and "NESD*" properties obeyed by some (but disobeyed by other)
single-winner voting systems </h2>
<p><small>
PRELIMINARY web page. By Warren D. Smith, Nov. 2009.
</small></p>  

<h3><u> Abstract </u></h3>
<p>
Which voting systems tend to cause a country to degenerate into a state of "2-party domination"
(2PD &ndash; or even worse, 1-party domination)? 
Note, this degeneration may happen gradually over a long time, perhaps more than 100 years,
during which many elections happen;
but once it happens it tends to be permanent.
We propose a tentative answer to that question: voting systems failing the "NESD property,"
or the closely related "NESD* property,"
are the ones that fall into 2PD.  
Further, the systems obeying NESD not only are the ones avoiding 2PD, they also
are the ones in which the influence of money on elections, inherently is greatly diminished.
It is pointed out that NESD is <i>incompatible</i> with the "majority-top property," and we
claim that (contrary to many careless claims by many people) the latter
actually is an undesirable voting system demand.
</p>

<h3><u> Definition </u></h3>

<p>
A single-winner voting system obeys the <b>"NESD property"</b> if, when every
voter (all voters assumed initially honest)
changes her ballot to "exaggerate about A &amp; B," i.e. to
now rank A top and B bottom (or B top and A bottom;
which depends on the voter and is "honest" about that voter's preference between
A and B alone), leaving it otherwise
unaltered &ndash; these alterations constitute NES, 
<a href="assets/documents/ConitzerSmanipEasy.pdf"><i>n</i>aive <i>e</i>xaggeration <i>s</i>trategy</a> &ndash;
that exaggeration-behavior does not <i>always</i> (ignoring very rare "exact tie" situations) 
cause A or B to win.
</p><p>
We also define the "NESD*" property (note the star) to be the same as NESD except A
and B are to be <i>solely</i>-top-rated or ranked by all voters;
we forbid coequal top.
</p>
<h3><u> Hypothesis </u></h3>
Voting systems failing NESD will tend to cause a country
to become 2-party dominated (or at least, will make that fate likely).
</p>

<h3><u> Voting systems failing and obeying NESD and NESD* </u></h3>

<p>
<b>Systems failing NESD:</b>
IRV (instant runoff voting), <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, 
Bucklin, and all Condorcet systems.
[By the latter I here mean, with pure-rank-order ballots &ndash;
no rank-equalities permitted.]
Also, for score-style ballots the
"greatest median score wins" system fails NESD... unless a third-party candidate is
given the maximum allowed score by a (larger) voter majority.
</p><p>
It also is possible to consider <i>multi</i>winner voting systems and ask whether
heavy use of NES (naive exaggeration strategy) voting will force them to deliver
2-party domination.  Then STV-PR systems (using rank-order ballots)
and PR systems based on plurality-style voting
such as "party list" and Simmons' flavor of <a href="https://rangevoting.org/Asset.htnl">asset</a> voting
both fail NESD.
</p><p>
<b>
Systems obeying NESD:
</b>
Borda, approval and <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voting.
The two-round genuine runoff system 
(but <i>not</i> any one-election-only "instant" approximation).
Incidentally, one similarly would predict a priori that with top-2 runoff,
<i>three</i>-party domination should develop, since votes
for the 4th-leading candidate are likely to be "wasted" and hence
will be artificially diminished with strategically-aware voters, whereas
votes for the leading three candidates are much more likely to be able to have an effect.
</p>
<p>
However: Borda <i>restricted</i> to 3-candidate elections fails NESD.
</p>
<p>
If we <i>modify</i> IRV to permit rank equalities by counting a ballot with K
candidates co-equal top as 1/K votes for each, then the resulting system passes
NESD, although I still feel uncomfortable about it because being
co-equal top is plainly a lot worse and more vulnerable than being
sole-top (there is kind of a "discontinuity," unlike in range voting
where it is "continuous" as you move across the top score), so strategic
voters might not do the former.
</P><p>
This is made clearer via an analogy. 
Consider plurality voting with "equal votes" permitted
(i.e. you can vote "half" for Jefferson and "half" for Adams).
This would
clearly be stupid, i.e. would clearly be essentially equivalent
strategically to plain plurality.   Why?
Consider each of your half-votes
one at a time.  If for the first, your best move was to vote
Jefferson; then for the second, the same reasoning should apply. Hence
you'd vote 100% for Jefferson and essentially <i>never use</i> the equality feature
(unless you were a strategic idiot).   Plurality with
equals permitted, does technically pass NESD, but this reasoning suggests that
is a misleading perception.  Really, to avoid being misled, one instead
should consider the NESD* property.
</P><p>
If we consider Condorcet systems with rank-equalities permitted, these
also technically pass NESD but
again there is that worrying "discontinuity."  So we now enquire which voting systems
pass NESD*:
</P>
<p><b>Fail NESD*:</b>
IRV, plurality, Condorcet (all with rank-equalities permitted or
forbidden, both ways they fail NESD*).
</p><p><b>Pass NESD*:</b> Range voting.</p>
<p><b>NESD* not applicable:</b> Approval voting.
</p>

<h3><u> Motivation behind NESD </u></h3>
<p>
NESD stands for "Naive Exaggeration Strategy &rArr; Duopoly."
</p><p>
"NES" refers to the voter strategy of
</p><ol><li>
identify the "top two" candidates most likely to win;
</li><li>
Exaggerate your (otherwise honest) vote to rank one top
and the other bottom. (With NESD*, unique-top; with NESD, permitted to be
co-equal top.) It appears that, in the real world, this is a pretty
close approximation of
what a very large percentage of voters in large well publicized+polled
elections actually do (it does not necessarily always make complete
sense that they do that, but the data indicates about 85% of Australian rank-order voters
do it anyway CITE???, plus Swedish voters given <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a>-voting-style
ballots in a nationwide survey-<a href="assets/documents/Lewin1998ScandinavianPoliticalStudies.pdf">study</a> 
also did it).
</li></ol>
<p>
The "D" part means: if all (or merely a sufficiently large percentage) of voters
exhibit NES behavior, then one of the apparent-top-two frontrunners
will always win (except
in exceedingly unlikely "perfect-tie" scenarios), yielding 2-party <i>d</i>omination.
</p><p>
And in fact, the same winner will arise as in strategic plurality
voting, so any system failing NESD or NESD* can be accused (perhaps not with
full justification, but certainly with some) of being "equivalent in the real world"
to plain plurality voting.  If so, it presumably
over historical time will <a href="Duverger.html">yield</a>
"duopoly," aka "2-party domination" where voters effectively only
get one of two choices (or no choice) every election. 
This severely diminishes voter
choice and "democracy"  (as opposed to some system with more
than 2 choices).
</p><p>
It's an interesting property (or two properties if we count NESD* also) and I think worth
consideration.
</p><blockquote><small>
You can now ask yourself other interesting questions, like "how can I
design good voting systems passing NESD or NESD*?" etc.
</small></blockquote>

<h3><u> Conflict with "Majority-Top" property </u></h3>

<p>
<b>Definition:</b> A voting system obeys "Majority-Top" if, whenever a voter-majority
ranks X unique-top in their vote, then X must win the election.
</P><p>
Jonathan Lundell pointed out the (obvious, once you see it) fact that
the (apparently desirable) NESD* property, <i>conflicts</i> with the 
(also apparently desirable) Majority-Top property:
It is impossible for a voting system to obey both.
</p>

<h3><u> Lesson: the demise of Majority-Top  </u></h3>

<p>
My personal lesson from this: Majority-Top is <i>not</i> an always-desirable property
for voting systems, despite the common perception that it "obviously" is.
Indeed, consider a <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> (0 to 9) election like this:
</p>
<table bgcolor="lightyellow">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>Their Vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A=9, B=0, C=7</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>A=0, B=9, C=7</td></tr>
<tr><td> 9</td><td>A=0, B=0, C=9</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A 51% voter-majority scores B unique-top. 
Therefore, in any voting system obeying Majority-Top,
B must win.
However, it seems pretty clear in this situation that C would generally be the best winner
for society. And it is the range voting winner (totals: <b>C=718</b>, B=459, A=360)
and also the one who would probably be elected by
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting.
</p><p>
This situation often arises where there are two power-groups, the A-ites and the B-ites,
each of whom wishes to destroy the other.   If the A-ites gain a slight majority,
game over.   However, it could be there is some middle course ("C") which everybody,
regardless of their  power-group,
finds reasonably attractive, although comparatively few regard C
as the <i>best</i> option for them.
Should it really be demanded, as a core principle of voting systems, that 
this middle course must, under all circumstances, <i>always</i> lose?  I think not.
</p><p>
Another election example worth thinking about re this
(devised by Balinski &amp; Laraki) is <a href="CondorcetCycles.html#demiseNM2">here</a>.
</p><p>
If you agree, even in a single election instance,
then you must drop the Majority-Top property as a demand.  (Remember, this
logical property brooks no exceptions.  You, by agreeing with even a single exception,
disagree with the logical property.)
</p>
<blockquote><small>
An analogous example-election in the rank-order-ballot world might be
<br>
<table bgcolor="lightyellow">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th>Their Vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>40</td><td>A>C>P>Q>R>S>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>B>C>S>R>Q>P>A</td></tr>
<tr><td> 9</td><td>C</td></tr>
</table>
Do you agree with me that declaring C, not B, winner would usually be better for society?
</small></blockquote>

<h3><u> Proof? </u></h3>

<p>
I do not see any feasible way to prove this whole theory.  It would seem
to require enacting lots of voting systems in lots of countries, then waiting 200
years to see what happens.  That is not feasible.  Nor probably ethical either.
It looks to me that this theory is arguably supported by, or at
least not refuted by, all evidence so far
(from all countries using various voting systems so far).
(The theory <i>is</i> falsifiable in principle.)
</p><p>
These same complaints unfortunately 
could be made about <i>any</i> theory of which voting systems
engender 2-party domination.
I'm not convinced my theory is correct, but do suspect it is going in
the right direction, and largely approximately correct (all in some admittedly vague
sense).
