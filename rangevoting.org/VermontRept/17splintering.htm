        <hr>

<p>IRV completely eliminates the problem in our existing system of multiple candidates
splintering constituencies resulting unrepresentative outcomes. Our existing
winner-take-all plurality voting system provides a powerful disincentive for offering
voters a range of choices. With current plurality rules, a third party candidate entering
a race is most likely to help the candidate furthest from the third party&#146;s
perspective, thus alienating potential supporters. In some cases, third parties have
attempted to use this reality as a blunt instrument to extract concessions from major
parties. The threat of running a candidate may elicit a change in a major party
candidate&#146;s position, but only if the threat is plausible. New Mexico is a place
where this threat is more than merely plausible, with the Green Party now regularly
denying Democrats what they may consider their &quot;rightful&quot; election in liberal
districts. Since IRV eliminates this splintering effect, some third parties likely will
feel freer to run candidates and voters will feel freer to vote their true preferences.
This may be perceived as undesirable by major party leaders who do not understand the new
dynamic of IRV. Multiple candidacies are only a problem if we use our existing plurality
rules. With plurality rules, third parties are considered dangerous both to the major
parties as well as to fair election outcomes (due to the vote splintering effect). So,
while IRV may open the door to third party candidacies, at the same time it eliminates the
problem that third party candidacies may create in our existing system. </p>
