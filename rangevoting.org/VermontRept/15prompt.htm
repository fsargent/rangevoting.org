<p>Since it is not being proposed that Vermont poll workers perform the transfers and
re-tabulations on election night, the concern is that the public will be upset with a new
delay in getting results. The IRV retabulations would be carried out by a court-appointed
recount committee at least a couple of weeks after the election day. However, in fact, the
same amount of information, first-choice results, will be available just as quickly as
under the existing system. In races where there is a majority winner, IRV will not change
the reporting time at all. In statewide races, where no majority is achieved by any
candidate, IRV can provide <i>new</i> information that remains undiscovered with our
current system -- that is, which of the candidates a majority of voters actually prefer.
In an age of instant gratification, some may argue that it is better to pick the plurality
candidate and declare that person elected quickly than to worry about which candidate the
majority of voters would have picked.</p>

<p>While technically there is no winner for any constitutional offices until the General
Assembly convenes almost two months later, since only the General Assembly can certify a
winner, as a practical matter, unless there is a recount, the winner in majority races is
generally &quot;known&quot; the next day. However, in the case of Governor, Lieutenant
Governor and Treasurer, when there is no majority winner, under our existing system the
result is genuinely not known until January when the General Assembly votes by secret
ballot. IRV would not change the constitutional fact that the winner is not official until
January. As a practical matter, however, IRV will allow the voters and the members of the
General Assembly to know if there is a candidate a majority of voters prefer, and thus
which candidate will be declared elected, more than a month quicker than under existing
law.</p>
