<p>Stability in government, which fairly reflects changes in voter attitudes, is
beneficial for both civil society and commerce. Plurality voting systems are subject to
extreme swings in government even if there is no change in public sentiment, depending on
the number and mix of candidates in a race. If a majority of the voters are of persuasion <i>a</i>,
and there is only one candidate who advocates <i>a</i>, that candidate will win. But if in
the next election there are two or more candidates advocating <i>a</i>, a candidate who
advocates <i>b</i>, who is intensely disapproved of by the majority of voters, can win
under plurality rules. IRV, like all majoritarian systems, is, of course, also subject to
swings, but only if the public attitude itself shifts, or if the population is nearly
evenly divided between two competing camps. Any voting system, such as Vermont&#146;s,
that allows the minority to defeat the majority is subject to undemocratic and wild swings
in government. This is a strong argument in favor of adopting IRV.</p>
