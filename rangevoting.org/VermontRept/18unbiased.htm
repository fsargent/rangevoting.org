<a href="CORR18.html"><font color="green">
This reform does not give advantage or disadvantage to conservatives, liberals, major
parties, or minor parties</font></a>. 
As evidence of the nonpartisan nature of this reform, note that
among the sponsors of the 1998 instant runoff voting bill, H.665, were a conservative
Republican, Rep. Dwyer, a moderate Republican, Rep. Little, a conservative Democrat, Rep.
Howrigan, a liberal Democrat, Rep. Woodward, and a Progressive, Rep. Bouricius. This
reform eliminates the concern about vote splintering or wasted votes. 
<a href="CORR18.html#mlq2"><font color="green">
Voters have every
incentive to vote their true beliefs</font></a> -- their favorite candidate first, their next
favorite second and so on -- because their ballot can still count toward a winner if their
first choice loses. 
<a href="CORR18.html#mlq2"><font color="green">
There also is no reason for voters not to rank as many candidates as
they want</font></a>, as a voter&#146;s 
lower choice will never help defeat one of that voter&#146;s
higher choices. </p>
