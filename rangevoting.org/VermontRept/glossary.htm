<p><b>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</b>: This is a voting system used to determine a majority
winner in a single-seat race from a field of candidates. With IRV, each voter has one vote
and ranks candidates in order of choice (1, 2, 3, etc.). All first choices are counted,
and if no candidate wins a majority of first choices the retabulation of ballots simulates
a series of run-off elections. The last place candidate (candidate with the least
first-choices) is eliminated. Ballots of voters who ranked the eliminated candidate first
are then redistributed to their second-choice candidates, as indicated on each
voter&#146;s ballot. First-choice ballots for candidates still in the running are again
counted for those favored candidates. Last place candidates are successively eliminated
and ballots are redistributed to next choices until one candidate remains or a candidate
gains over 50% of votes. IRV is not a system of proportional representation.</p>

<p><b>Plurality election rule</b>: Under plurality elections, in a single-seat race, the
candidate with the most votes wins even if that represents a minority of voters. With a
field of five candidates, it is possible to win with as little as 21% of the vote, for
example. Plurality winners may, or may not, be the most preferred-choice of a majority of
the voters. For this reason, it is sometimes called &quot;minority rule.&quot; Plurality
election rules are common in the U.S. and Vermont.</p>

<p><b>Proportional Representation (PR)</b>: This refers to a variety of systems used for electing
a legislature in which the number of seats a party wins is more or less proportional to
the percentage of popular votes received. PR does NOT refer to a parliamentary system in
which the executive branch of government is selected by the legislative branch. PR can be
used to elect the legislature in either a parliamentary or a presidential system such as
the United States&#146;. PR is not part of this Commission&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Single Transferable Vote (STV)</b>: This is a preference voting system in which voters rank
candidates in order of preference. The single vote can be transferred from one candidate
to another according to the voters&#146; rankings, depending on the cumulative result of
other voters&#146; ballots. STV can be used for IRV winner-take-all elections, and in
multi-seat PR elections. In IRV elections, ballots can only be transferred from eliminated
candidates to candidates still in the running. In PR elections, ballots can also be
transferred from the surplus of a winning candidate, who has surpassed the winning
threshold, to voters&#146; alternate choices so as to minimize the number of wasted votes
and achieve overall proportionality.</p>

<p><b>Winner-Take-All election:</b> In contrast to PR, winner-take-all refers to an election rule
whereby the majority (or in the case of plurality elections, merely the largest faction)
in a district receives 100% of the seats. Some offices, such as Governor, are inherently
winner-take-all, since there is only one seat. All Vermont elections are currently
winner-take-all. Winner-take-all systems tend to exclude minority voices from legislative
debate.<br>
