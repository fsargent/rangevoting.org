Constitution</font></b></h2>

        <hr>

<p>The essence of this question revolves around Chapter II sec. 47 of the Vermont
Constitution, which requires the General Assembly to elect a Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, or Treasurer whenever there is no election by the people. Would IRV preempt the
General Assembly and provide an alternative method of resolving the situation when there
was no majority? </p>

<p>This would be unconstitutional if an IRV bill attempted to bypass the General
Assembly&#146;s authority, but that can easily be avoided. Under existing law and under
H.665 only the General Assembly canvassing committee appointed in January can declare a
candidate elected. Under existing law and H.665, other bodies including a canvassing
committee consisting of members appointed by the major parties and the court in the case
of recounts or other challenges can advise the official General Assembly canvassing
committee as to which candidate received &quot;the major part of the votes.&quot; The
actual voting method is not mentioned in the constitution and it has changed over time.
The General Assembly may pass a law which defines in statute what &quot;the major part of
the votes&quot; means within any particular system of voting, whether that be instant
runoff voting, or our existing system. If, after transfers, a candidate ends up with a
majority, this can be legally defined as &quot;the major part of the votes.&quot; In this
case, the election is not given to the General Assembly since the second controlling
phrase, &quot;[if] there shall be no election,&quot; does not get activated. Since voting
for alternative choices is proposed to be optional, it is still possible for there to be
an outcome after the transfers in which there is still no majority, and with no candidate
receiving &quot;the major part of the votes&quot; there would have been &quot;no
election&quot; and the General Assembly would proceed to elect from among the top three
candidates.</p>

<p>Another constitutional question that might have been raised, as to whether the
constitution allows voters to express more than one preference on a ballot, is answered
definitively by precedent of other court challenges in states such as Ohio, Massachusetts
and Michigan. In all cases, preference voting has been universally upheld. In some of
these court challenges, it was unsuccessfully argued that IRV, or other preference voting
systems, gave voters more than one vote and thus violated the one person one vote rule.
This is wrong on several counts. First, the one person one vote rule simply is a shorthand
description of equal voting power for each voter. Otherwise, at-large elections such as
the Chittenden County Senate race where voters get six votes, or the two-seat
representative districts, where voters get two votes, would be problematic. But more
fundamentally, IRV does not give voters more than one vote for Governor. The name for
preference voting systems used internationally and by political scientists is the &quot;<i>single</i>
transferable vote&quot; (STV). The name describes the fact that there is only one net vote
to be had, but that the vote for the candidate for whom it will ultimately count can be
transferred. Even if one concluded, contrary to court precedent and political science
understanding, that IRV did entail more than one vote, the specific wording in the Vermont
Constitution is accommodating in that it uses the plural noun &quot;votes&quot; in
describing the task of the voters to &quot;bring in their votes for Governor...&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, the changes envisioned by the use of IRV are far less troubling than the
existing flagrant deviations from the voting procedure as far as it <i>is</i> described in
sec. 47. The details that are no longer complied with are: 1. the voters &quot;bring their
votes for Governor, with the name fairly written.&quot; (The ballots are now preprinted
and provided by the polling officials as a result of the reforms of 1890, and preprinted
party ballots have been deemed constitutionally acceptable since at least 1832. Also,
voters are no longer fequired to &quot;<i>bring</i>&quot; in their votes, but may<i> send </i>in
absentee ballots, contrary to an 1864 opinion of the Vermont Supreme Court.) 2. The
Constable receives the ballots and seals them up. (The General Assembly long ago provided
for a more practical secure and convenient polling procedure with local polling officials
who are not constables.) 3. With no counting of the ballots, the constables &quot;deliver
them to the Representatives chosen to attend the General Assembly&quot; in January.
(Currently, the ballots are counted locally, a summary sheet is prepared and the results
transferred to a return form which is delivered or mailed to the Secretary of State within
48 hours. Then a statewide canvassing committee, consisting of representatives of the
major parties, reviews the return forms from all over the state and prepares a draft
certificate of election for the use of the General Assembly.) 4. In January the General
Assembly meets and appoints a committee to &quot;receive, sort, and count the votes for
Governor&quot;, Lieutenant Governor and Treasurer. (The General Assembly does appoint a
committee in January, but it never sees the votes, does not sort or count them, but
instead reviews and adopts a report provided by the Secretary of State.)</p>

<p>All of these existing deviations from Constitutionally mandated procedures, however,
are probably not &quot;unconstitutional&quot; in that the goals and purpose of section 47
is to assure a fair and honest determination of the voters&#146; will. The technologies
and customs of the times have changed markedly since the 1700's. Printed ballots are
easily distributed, the mails are more reliable, voting machines can make the sorting of
ballots unnecessary, etc. As the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in <i>Temple vs. Mead</i>
(1832), when the use of printed ballots instead of handwritten ballots was challenged,
Section 47 &quot;was intended to secure to the freemen the privilege of voting for the
officers therein named by ballot. . .&quot;and the procedure of balloting may evolve with
the times. </p>
