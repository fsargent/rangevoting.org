<p>At present in Vermont it is not uncommon for a candidate to be elected with less than a
majority of votes cast. Under current law, It is possible for a candidate preferred by the
majority of voters to be defeated by a candidate strongly opposed by a majority of the
voters. The arrival of campaign finance reform, including public financing beginning in
the year 2000, may exacerbate this problem by allowing a larger number of credible
candidates. Especially when there is no incumbent, it is likely many races will have split
votes with no majority winner. </p>

<p>Under Vermont law, most races can be won with a plurality of under 50% of the vote,
while some races, by our constitution, are thrown to the General Assembly to choose from
among the top three vote-getters. This has already happened 69 times in Vermont history
including the recent Lieutenant Governor contest. Both scenarios are less democratic than
we might like or need to accept. Split votes, whether on the left or the right, can result
in undemocratic or questionable outcomes. For instance, the election of Reform Party
candidate, Jesse &quot;the Body&quot; Ventura, as Governor of Minnesota with just 37% of
the vote, leaves one wondering if that reflects the majority will of the voters. </p>

<p>In Vermont, in the case of no majority for the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor
and Treasurer, the decision is taken out of the voters&#146; hands altogether and given to
legislators. If there is no Governor-elect in November, there is no budget or
administration being prepared, and the factors considered by legislators may not always
reflect the choice that the voters would have made. In January, when the General Assembly
convenes, some legislators will vote for the top statewide vote-getter, some will vote as
their district voted (although their district may also have been divided with no majority
winner), some will vote based on secret deals, and some will vote according to party. In
any event, democracy and the principle of majority rule are diminished.</p>

<p>In Alaska, with a solid Republican majority in the legislature, Governor Knowles, a
Democrat, was elected with just 41% of the vote because a strong Ross Perot-style
independent party was in the race. In a recent election for Congress from New Mexico,
Democrat Eric Serna got 39.8%, Green Party candidate Carol Miller got 16.8% and Republican
Bill Redmond got 42.7% and won the election. In Alaska, Republicans have made IRV a
priority, and in New Mexico, the Democrats have. But, regardless of our possible happiness
with particular outcomes, we all should be interested. Election results should reflect the
will of the voters.</p>

<p>A solution some states have adopted, particularly in the South, is to hold runoff
elections. Two-election runoffs, however, have many problems. Runoffs extend the campaign
season and cost money for both the taxpayers who fund the election and the candidates who
must renew campaign fund-raising. Runoffs often have a drop-off in turnout that may yield
an unrepresentative result, with the &quot;winner&quot; receiving fewer votes than the
loser had gotten in the original election. In Vermont, there is also a constitutional
obstacle to using a two-election runoff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vermont&#146;s election laws are ill-equipped to deal with more than two serious
candidates in a race. With public financing offering the prospect of increased voter
choice, a dramatic splintering of votes could not only cause the election of a highly
unpopular candidate, it could further exacerbate the cynicism of an already cynical
public.</p>
