<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#C00000">Mock Election Demonstrations using IRV in Vermont Schools</font></h3>
        <hr>

<p>As resolved in HR.37, the established Commission observed the process of Instant Runoff
Voting by conducting mock elections in various classes at six high schools and two junior
high schools in Vermont. These mock elections were held during the months of September,
October, November and December at Lamoille Union, Middlebury, West Rutland, Black River
(Ludlow), U32 (E. Montpelier), Bellows Free Academy (St. Albans), Harwood Union (Duxbury),
and Mt. Abraham Union (Bristol). Prior to the mock election, a brief presentation was held
regarding HR.37, the history of Vermont elections and the history of IRV. Students were
first encouraged to discuss the meaning of democracy. The majority of students recognized
that the process of democracy has continued to evolve and develop internationally, in our
nation and in the state of Vermont, and that different systems of voting may be discussed
as being &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; democratic. </p>

<p>At the close of the presentation and discussion, students participated in both the
voting and counting procedures of the mock IRV election. Students were given a ballot with
four former United States presidents and asked to read the directions, printed as they
might appear on an actual IRV election ballot. Various ballot designs were used to gauge
how user-friendly they might be. In a few schools, the directions were read aloud to the
students, as well. The students, then, proceeded to vote by ranking the candidates in
order of preference. Four volunteer students collected and counted the ballots, counting
the first-choice votes first. In most of the classes, no candidate received an initial
majority of the votes. Students comprehended the process of transferring votes from the
lowest ranked candidate and continued the process by redistributing the votes to find the
candidate truly preferred by the majority of voters. </p>

<p>In some of the mock elections, the process of IRV revealed that a candidate who had not
received the greatest plurality of initial votes, was the candidate actually preferred,
over the plurality candidate, by the majority of the students. </p>

<p>At the close of class, students were given evaluation forms that were to be collected
by the teacher and mailed to the Commission. As of this writing, five of the schools,
representing 120 students have returned their evaluation forms. A copy of the evaluation
form submitted to the students and a chart of the results of the evaluations, along with a
copy of the actual mock election ballot, may be found in Chart 2 on page 35.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of all students expressing an opinion, 91% said that marking the ballot was <i>not</i>
&quot;too difficult or confusing.&quot; (If junior high students are excluded, the figure
rises to 93%.) Since the ballots were not explained to the students in detail, the
Commission finds this very encouraging. In a real election, sample ballots that show how
to mark the ballot should all but eliminate concerns about IRV&#146;s supposed complexity
for the voters. There is no evidence that voting in an IRV election is any more confusing
than our current system. </p>

<p>In the evaluations, 20% of the students said that their parents don't vote regularly,
and of those who ventured a guess, 17% said they doubted they themselves would vote
regularly once they turned eighteen. The correlation of these two answers is impressive,
with 100% of those who doubted they would vote reporting that their parents also do not
vote regularly. </p>

<p>As to the question of whether IRV would encourage greater voter participation, 42
students, or 35%, said they would be more likely to vote if IRV were used, only four
students (3%) said they would be less likely, with the rest indicating it would make no
difference. Of the nineteen students who said that they would not vote regularly, once
they turned eighteen, three students (or 16% of that group) said that they would be more
likely to vote if Vermont had a preference voting system such as Instant Runoff Voting. </p>

<p>Of the 116 students expressing an opinion,<i> </i>90% said Vermont should use Instant
Runoff Voting. As happened with the members of this Commission, once students understood
how IRV works to restore the principle of majority rule, it is almost universally favored
over our existing system. </p>

<p>Some of the classes also received a brief explanation of proportional representation in
electing legislative bodies. Of the 84 students who answered the following question,
&quot;Do you think Vermont should consider using proportional representation for electing
either its House of Representatives or its State Senate?&quot; 93% said yes. The
Commission did not feel it had sufficient time to adequately address this side of
preference voting but suggests that this public enthusiasm warrants further examination of
proportional representation by the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The four Commission members who observed the presentations and mock elections at the
various schools all testify to the interest of the students in the Instant Runoff system,
their recognition of the system as &quot;more fair&quot; or &quot;more democratic,&quot;
as well as their interest in the continued study of proportional representation by the
Vermont State Legislature. </p>
