<p>Existing state law gives the Secretary of State authority to approve designs of ballots
within guidelines. It is possible and desirable to redesign the ballot to allow voters to
mark their ballots in exactly the same manner as they have in the past. The option of
ranking alternate choices should probably be treated as an add-on section of the ballot.
Unlike Australian federal elections, Vermont should use optional preference voting as is
done in New South Wales and other jurisdictions within Australia. This way, those voters
loathe to change, could still mark their ballots as they are used to -- with the same
amount of input into the outcome of the Governor&#146;s election as they ever had in the
past. Such voters would be forgoing the new power, unavailable under current law, to help
select the winner in case there is no majority winner. Thus the traditionalist who
refrains from ranking alternatives does not have a diminution of power, but simply is
voluntarily not seizing an additional input opportunity. </p>

<p>A preference ballot can be designed with the goal of making it simple for the voter to
understand and mark, or with the goal of making it easy for poll workers in those towns
that do hand counts. For example, a ballot design that simply has the voter put a rank
number next to each candidate is simple for the voter but may slow down the count since
all candidates may have some mark next to their name, the counter will need just that much
more attention to pick out the &quot;1.&quot; </p>

<p>An alternate design that has a separate column of boxes or circles for indicating
alternate choice numbers is quick and easy to count, since the first-choice stands out
more. Another reason for having a separate column for alternate choices, is to help
distinguish those races using IRV, in which voters are allowed to indicate alternate
choices from those races voters are still limited to a first choice only. A design of this
sort may also be necessary for machine-read ballots, so that indications of alternate
choices are physically separated from that portion of the ballot where the machine scans
for a first-choice mark. Of course, machine ballots are already different than hand-count
ballots in Vermont. Finding the optimal point of balance between ease for the voters and
ease for the counters will be a judgement call. While Cambridge, Massachusetts, uses a
machine read preference ballot, most countries use a hand count ballot exclusively.</p>
