<p>&quot;Wasted&quot; votes are a particular problem with the single seat winner-take-all
plurality elections common in the U. S. Many votes can be described as &quot;wasted.&quot;
<a href="CORR08wasted.html#mlq1"><font color="green">
Voters who vote for a most preferred candidate that turns out to have no chance of
winning, not only waste their vote, but may actually inadvertently contribute to the
election of their least preferred candidate</font></a>
due to a splitting of the vote. But there are
many other &quot;wasted&quot; votes. Voters who vote for a lower preference candidate
under the mistaken impression that their first choice candidates couldn&#146;t win will
feel the votes were wasted when it turns out the favored candidate might have had a good
chance after all. IRV eliminates this kind of &quot;wasted&quot; vote problem.</p>

<p>However, IRV does not alleviate other types of &quot;wasted&quot; votes. The Voters of
party A who live in a district that is overwhelmingly dominated by party B voters may feel
their votes are wasted since they never get to help elect a representative. Voters who
support the dominant party B may also feel their votes are &quot;wasted&quot; as they are
not needed. The feeling of these voters that they are &quot;wasting&quot; their votes
certainly discourages voter participation in the U.S. Such noncompetitive districts (often
a result of gerrymandering) are common throughout the U.S. and Vermont. With IRV, up to
49% of voters may feel their votes were wasted, whereas with our existing plurality rules,
a significant majority of voters may feel they &quot;wasted&quot; their votes. </p>
