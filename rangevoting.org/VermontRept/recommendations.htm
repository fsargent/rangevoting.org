<p>1. The state should adopt an IRV bill, similar to H.665 from the 1998 session, for all
statewide elections beginning in the year 2000. The offices included are: Governor,
Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Secretary of State, Auditor of Accounts, Attorney General,
U.S. Senators, U.S. Representative, and electoral college electors (as a block) for
President and Vice-President.</p>

<p>2. An IRV law should be structured to allow the option of ranking as many alternates as
they wish, but allow individual voters to continue single-choice voting.</p>

<p>3. The State should carry out a voter education campaign to familiarize voters with the
new ballots to ease the transition.</p>

<p>4. The General Assembly should study, either directly or through a citizen commission,
the idea of proportional representation for electing legislative bodies.</p>
