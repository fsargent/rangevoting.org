        <hr>

<p>In our society, for many reasons, it is hard to get many voters to pay attention to
election campaigns. Unlike in a traditional two-round runoff election, voters only have to
pay attention once with IRV. A traditional runoff extends the campaign season and can be
met with a collective sigh of &quot;Oh no, here we go again.&quot; IRV increases the
likelihood that the ultimate decision will be made at the election with the greatest level
of citizen participation. Runoffs tend to have a lower voter turnout, though there are, of
course, exceptions. Imagine the turnout for a runoff for a more minor office such as state
Treasurer. The winner of a runoff may get fewer votes than an opponent got in the original
election, leading to doubts about the &quot;will of the people,&quot; hobbled legitimacy,
and lack of a perceived mandate.</p>

<p>Traditional runoffs are also costly, both to the taxpayer who must pay for the
duplicate election and to the candidates who must resume campaign fund-raising and prolong
the stress on their families and business lives. The cost of ballot retabulation in the
case of IRV is a tiny fraction of the cost of holding a new election.</p>

<p>Traditional runoffs can also create doubts about candidates&#146; sincerity as they
change their message and repackage themselves based on their narrowed opposition, and the
new perceived swing voters. </p>

<p>IRV eliminates one of the biggest confusions for many voters that traditional runoffs
don&#146;t solve. When there are more than two candidates, many voters currently make a
complex calculus of what candidate they want compared to what candidate they think can win
and what candidate they don&#146;t want that might win if they &quot;waste&quot; their
vote on the candidate they actually prefer. The complexity of this assessment frustrates
many voters who may feel either resentment or shame in voting for what they see as the
&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; while feeling forced to abandon their true preference.
While IRV eliminates the need for this calculation, it persists in traditional runoffs
that drop to the top two candidates. </p>

<p>In addition to retaining this complexity, traditional runoffs also introduce a new
element of possible manipulation. If voters are confident that there will be a runoff, and
their favored candidate will be in it, they may consider voting for the perceived
&quot;weaker&quot; or more extreme, opponent in hopes that that candidate will make it to
the runoff, knocking off the stronger opponent, and thus improving the chances of their
favored candidate. This manipulation may not be widespread but it is certainly real.
Witness Vermont&#146;s open primary in which voters whose party has no serious primary
challenges vote in the other party&#146;s primary for the perceived weakest opponent. It
is widely believed that this logic played a part in Fred Tuttle&#146;s U.S. Senate primary
victory.</p>

<p>In Vermont, there is also a constitutional barrier to using traditional runoffs for
electing a Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Treasurer. The votes cast to elect these
officers must be cast at a single particular election, when Vermonters elect their state
representatives, rather than at two separate elections. IRV simply retabulates those same
ballots and thus does not run afoul of this restriction. Changing the constitution is
extremely difficult. The time-lock on our constitution means that the soonest a change
could take effect is for the elections of 2004.</p>
