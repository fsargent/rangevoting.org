<H2> The CRV's corrections to Vermont report's "<a href="summary.htm">executive summary</a>"  </H2>

<a name="mlq1">
<p><b>Misleading quotes:</b>
"Vermont's  plurality election rules allow for the election of a candidate with the most, but less than half, of the votes, even if the majority of voters oppose this candidate and prefer a different one."
"IRV assures that a candidate preferred by the majority of voters will not be defeated by a candidate preferred by a minority."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
Although the first sentence is true, is misleads by suggesting that IRV would fix this problem;
the second sentence is flat-out false.
The truth is that IRV can <i>also</i> elect a candidate with
"less than half of the (top-rank) votes, 
even if the majority of voters... prefer a different one."
(<a href="../rangeVirv.html#nasty">example</a> where IRV elects a candidate D with 17% of
the top-rank votes, despite the fact that 33% of the voters gave C their top-rank vote
<i>and</i> the electorate explicitly stated in their votes that
they preferred C over D by a landslide margin of nearly 2-to-1 over voters preferring C over D).
</p>

<a name="mlq2">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"IRV would allow citizens to honestly vote according to their consciences. With Vermont's existing 
system, some voters struggle with the decision of whether to vote for the candidate they actually 
prefer, or whether to vote for a perceived `lesser evil' candidate who 
may have a better chance of winning, for fear of inadvertently helping the candidate the 
voter likes the least. IRV does not penalize a voter for voting honestly, as can happen with 
our existing system."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
This is simply flat-out false:
IRV can indeed penalize a voter for voting honestly (<a href="../TarrIrv.html">example</a>,
and <a href="../IRVpartic.html">another</a>)
by then causing the "greater evil" to be elected, whereas a dishonest vote
would have caused the "lesser evil" to be elected.
Also, IRV can penalize a voter for voting <i>at all</i>, i.e, a voter, by casting his
honest vote, causes a worse election result than if he simply had refused to vote
(<a href="../IRVpartic.html">example</a>).
</p>

<a name="mlq3">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b> <a name="minor">
"IRV does not give advantage or disadvantage to major parties or minor parties."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
This is simply flat-out false.  IRV
<a href="../TarrIrv.html#facts">has led</a>, in every country that has used it,
to self-reinforcing 2-party domination, same as with plurality voting.
This is agreed by analysts in those countries.  It is not in dispute.
It is particularly clear in <a href="../AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>
(whose house is 2-party dominated since it uses IRV, but
whose senate is not, since it does not use IRV) and 
<a href="../MaltaPol.html">Malta</a> (massive 2-party domination)
which are the two countries with the greatest historical experience using IRV.
Indeed
again according to the Australian analysts at
<a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml">
http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml</a>
the "disadvantages of the Preferential [IRV] System"
include "it <i>promotes a two-party system</i> to the detriment of minor parties and independents."
And see, e.g. 
<a href="../Karvonen.html">this paper</a>.
</p>

<a name="mlq4">
<p><b>Misleading quotes:</b>
"IRV is preferable to a two-round runoff election in that it saves money, assures that the 
deciding election will have maximum voter turnout, and does not face constitutional problems"
"IRV does not increase the cost of elections."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
It is not at all clear that the single-round IRV system "saves money" versus
a two-round runoff, because (a) each round of the two-round runoff may be counted using
old-style, non-computerized, non-networked, plurality-voting machines, but counting
an IRV election cannot, and 
(b) in the two-round runoff system, often the second round is not needed, and
(c) IRV makes near-ties and ties much more common, which often lead to costly litigation
and recounts.
We are not saying their "saves money" claim is necessarily 
false, but it is not supported by
a shred of actual financial evidence
anywhere in the Vermont report and hence we see no clear reason to believe it 
is true either.  It is mere unsupported speculation and as such does not belong in
this report, especially with the opposing point of view being (as here) simply ignored.
Obviously if you have to buy all new voting machines, that is a big expense.
</p>
<p>
It is completely false to say IRV "does not increase the cost of elections"
(versus the plain plurality system Vermont uses now) since obviously it
will.  Indeed 
according to the Australian analysts at
<a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml">
http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml</a>
(Australia has more experience with IRV than any other country)
the "disadvantages of the Preferential [IRV] System" 
include "it is more complicated to administer and count."
</p>
<p>
Also, two-round runoffs have been used all over the USA for many years
(e.g. New York City and Denver
mayoral elections) and do not "face constitutional problems."
(The text misleadingly implies that they do but IRV does not.)
</p>

<a name="mlq5">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"IRV tends to reduce negative campaigning. One reason for this is concern over alienating voters who would not give a nasty campaigner a second-preference vote, which that candidate might need to win."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
This statement cannot be called "false" since it is subjective and vague and undefined &ndash;
but it similarly cannot be called "true"!  The Vermont report does not
present one iota of historical evidence for this.
It is mere unsupported speculation and as such does not belong in
this report.
And there in fact is some evidence
which might suggest <a href="../FraenkelG.html">the contrary</a>.
