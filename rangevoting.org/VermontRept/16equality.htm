(<a href="CORR16equality.html"><font color="green">correction</font></a>)
</b></h3>

<p>When the procedure of IRV is described, some people figure that the supporters of the
fringe candidates (those with the fewest votes) are getting two votes while supporters of
the top candidates get only one vote. This is not true. Every voter has exactly the same
clout with IRV. If there is no majority winner, the supporters of fringe candidates have
their candidate eliminated while the supporters of major candidates get to keep their
candidates in the running. While the bottom candidates&#146; voters have their ballots
transferred to their second choices and counted a second time, the voters who favored the
top candidates get to have their ballots remain with their favorite candidates and also
counted again. This is the same logic that is used in a regular runoff. In a regular
runoff, it is those voters whose favorite candidate is out of the running that decide the
outcome.</p>

<p>Another related confusion has to do with the notion that if low-ranking candidates were
dropped in some different order, their ballot transfers could produce a different winner.
This is not true. If the transfers from the bottom candidate(s) reveal a majority for a
particular one of the top candidates, then it is a mathematical truism that no other
candidate <i>could</i> have a majority (unless you had a perverse rule that eliminated one
of the top two candidates first).</p>
