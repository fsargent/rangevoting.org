<p>Unlike some states where voters once were required to loudly proclaim their choice of
candidates in front of election officials, Vermont favored the use of the secret ballot
from its very inception. Vermont&#146;s constitution has always required voters to
&quot;bring their votes for Governor, with the name fairly written.&quot; This language
was the core of an early constitutional challenge to one of the early changes to our
voting procedure. By the early 1800s, candidates, parties and newspapers were printing
lists of endorsed candidates that voters could submit as a ballot. The Vermont Supreme
Court ruled in <i>Temple vs. Mead</i> (1832), that the use of printed ballots instead of
handwritten ballots was acceptable, since the language in Section 47 &quot;was intended to
secure to the freemen the privilege of voting for the officers therein named by ballot. .
.&quot; rather than to require any particular method of balloting. The same section of
language was cited by the Vermont Supreme Court during the civil war to invalidate
absentee voting by Vermont&#146;s soldiers away at war, using the logic that
&quot;bring&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;send.&quot; In the twentieth century this
has obviously been reversed.</p>

<p>The biggest change to the procedure of voting in Vermont occurred at the end of the
nineteenth century with the adoption of the &quot;Australian ballot.&quot; Today the
phrase &quot;Australian ballot&quot; is used to distinguish voting by a secret ballot as
opposed to a face-to-face town meeting, but that is not what the term actually means.
Prior to 1892, ballots listing only favored candidates were provided by candidates,
parties and newspapers. The Australian innovation adopted by Vermont was the use of
government-printed ballots that listed all qualifying candidates.</p>

<p>Ironically, at the same time that Vermont started using the &quot;Australian&quot;
ballot, Australia was beginning the process of abandoning it, in favor of the modern
Australian ballot, which is a preference ballot used for IRV and PR elections.</p>

<p>In the first Vermont election using this new system, there was some protest of the new
voting procedure. Formerly, voters could prepare ballots at home or simply pick up party
ballots on their way to the polls. Voters had no need to mark ballots, they simply had to
deposit them in the ballot box. Now the voters had to go into a voting booth and find the
names of their preferred candidates and mark the right number of boxes depending on how
many seats were being filled for each office. There were long lines waiting for ballots
and spaces in polling booths, accompanied by many complaints. Rather than repealing the
Australian ballot, the legislature increased the ratio of polling booths the towns had to
provide from one for each 75 voters to one for each 50 voters. </p>

<p>The use of the Australian ballot also had implications for independent candidates and
smaller parties. How was it to be decided which candidates to list on the official ballot?
Unlike some states, Vermont has maintained a manageable petition threshold that allows any
serious candidate to appear on the ballot. The major change in Vermont&#146;s ballot
access laws was the adoption of state-sponsored party primaries in 1915.</p>

<p>There have been a few small changes to Vermont&#146;s &quot;Australian&quot; ballot
over the years. These include listing candidates in alphabetical order grouped by office,
rather than by party, as is still done by some other states to facilitate straight party
voting. </p>

<p>Some of the more far-reaching changes to Vermont&#146;s voting system have occurred in
this century. The most well-known change, of course, is the change in what groups of
citizens were included as part of the eligible voting pool -- extending suffrage to women
and young people between the ages of 18 and 21. </p>

<p>A less well-known but fundamental change has been the abandoning of the majority
requirement to win election. The acceptance of plurality winners is a rather recent change
in Vermont election law. For most of Vermont&#146;s history, all single seat races
required a majority to elect. In the case of legislative seats, if there was no majority a
new vote was held, repeatedly, until a majority was achieved. For Congress, this meant
elections a month or so apart. For state representatives, it meant re-voting on into the
night or the next day at a town meeting. The majority requirement was relaxed for most
elections by 1916, allowing plurality winners after a limited number of re-votes. Majority
rule was finally repealed altogether for all offices, other than constitutional offices,
only in 1940.</p>

<p>The shift to the plurality rule came in the midst of a period of one-party predominance
in which no statewide election was won by any candidate other than a Republican for over a
century. Because of the hegemony of just one, and later two, political parties, this
abandonment of one of the most basic principles of democracy -- majority rule -- went
unnoticed. With only one or two choices, candidates were sure to win with majorities
anyway. It is only with the reappearance of third party and serious independent
candidacies since the 1970's that the potentially undemocratic results of plurality rule
would again be a potential problem.</p>

<p>As State Archivist Gregory Sanford noted in his testimony to the Commission, Vermont
has continually changed its voting system in response to political stimuli.</p>
