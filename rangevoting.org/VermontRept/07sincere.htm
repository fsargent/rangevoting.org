        <hr>

<p>To accurately aggregate individual opinions into a community decision, a voting system
should encourage citizens to honestly vote according to their consciences. With our
existing system, some voters struggle with the decision of whether to vote for the
candidate they actually prefer, or whether to vote for a perceived &quot;lesser&quot;
candidate who may have a better chance of winning for fear of inadvertently helping the
candidate the voters like the least. </p>

<p>Various preference voting systems <i>other</i> than IRV, examined by this Commission,
such as approval voting, Bucklin voting, and at-large multi-seat voting (actually a
multi-vote <i>no</i>-preference system) suffer a similar problem of insincere tactical
voting. Voters who honestly express their second or subsequent choices on their ballots
may be penalized since those alternate-choice votes may cause the defeat of their most
preferred candidates. The &quot;smart&quot; voter with a strong first preference will
&quot;bullet vote,&quot; refraining from expressing any alternate choices. 
<a href="CORR07sincere.html"><font color="green">This is not a
difficulty with systems such as IRV, however, since voters who select second or subsequent
choices will not thereby help defeat their first choice</font></a>.</p>
