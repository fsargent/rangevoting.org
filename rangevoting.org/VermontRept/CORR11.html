<H2> CRV corrections to Vermont report's <a href="11simple.htm">section 11</a>  
</H2>

<a name="mlq1">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"IRV is simple for voters to use."
</p>

<p><b>Correction:</b>
Actually, when IRV was implemented in San Francisco 2004, not only did the tabulators
<a href="../SanFranDelay.html">fail</a> to count the votes, but the voter "spoiled ballot"
rate (ballots that had to be discarded due to voters filling them out in illegal ways)
<a href="../SPRates.html#sf">increased by a factor of 7</a>.
This suggests that actually, it is not quite as "simple" as the Vermont report makes it sound.
</p>

<a name="mlq2">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"The voter education campaign necessary to ease the transition..."
</p>

<p><b>Correction:</b>
The Vermont report is expressing the idea that IRV voting is simple for voters &ndash;
<i>but</i>, just to be sure, maybe they
have to be educated by a campaign  of public service announcements and get experience
using IRV, and <i>then</i> for sure it'll <i>really</i> be simple for voters.
However,
<a href="../AustralianPol.html">Australians</a>
have been using IRV for over 80 years and all their education and experience still
has led them to have
<a href="../SPRates.html#aust">remarkably high</a>
ballot spoilage rates, considerably higher than in the USA.
Again, this suggests that actually, it is not quite as "simple" as the Vermont report 
makes it sound.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to make arguments about simplicity if you never have to use an actual 
experimental fact 
in your argument...
