<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House resolution relating to the
creation of a Vermont Commission to Study Preference Voting</small></p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offered by: The Committee on
Local Government</small></p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, plurality
election rules in races with more than two candidates can result in a candidate opposed by
a majority of the voters being declared the winner, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, in 35 percent of all
election years in Vermont, one or more federal or statewide races had a result less than a
majority, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, in 23 percent of all
election years, the general assembly had to intercede to elect one or more statewide
officers, due to the lack of a popular majority, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, 21 times in Vermont&#146;s
history the governor was elected by the general assembly rather than the voters, due to a
failure to achieve the constitutionally required majority of popular votes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, the house of
representatives has often elected a statewide candidate who did not receive the greatest
number of votes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, in one election year with
no majority winner in the governor&#146;s race, the general assembly deadlocked and
elected no governor, forcing the lieutenant-governor to serve, and in another election
year with no majority in the treasurer&#146;s race the general assembly elected the
third-place candidate who had received only three percent of the popular vote and who
therefore refused to serve, leaving Vermont with no treasurer, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, recent presidential
elections in Vermont with more than two candidates indicate that the existing plurality
election rules cannot be certain to faithfully reflect majority voter sentiment, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, the advent of public
financing in certain statewide elections, beginning in the year 2000, could increase the
likelihood of multiple viable candidates, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, having more than two
credible candidates increases the chances of there being no majority winner, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, alternative voting systems
that solve this problem through an instant runoff or single transferable vote system are
used in democracies around the world, including Australia and Ireland, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Whereas</u>, the house of
representatives could benefit from a broad examination and public discussion of such
alternative voting systems, now therefore be it</small></p>

<p><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved by the House of
Representatives</u>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there is created a Vermont Commission
to Study Preference Voting that shall consist of a maximum of 12 Vermont residents,
one-half of whom shall be designated by the Vermont League of Women Voters, and one-half
of whom shall be designated by Vermont Common Cause and who shall represent a diversity of
political parties, and include at least one resident under the age of 25, and be it
further <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the League of Women
Voters and Common Cause shall forward the names and contact information of the commission
members so designated to the Secretary of State who shall designate one member of the
commission to act as convener for the first meeting at which the commission shall elect a
chair, and be it further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the commission shall
analyze possible impacts of public campaign financing as it relates to any increased
likelihood of failures to attain majorities, and to review alternative voting systems,
including the Australian single transferrable vote system and variants that would
facilitate popular majority rule in single seat elections or representative outcomes in
multiseat legislative elections, and be it further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the commission shall
give its highest priority to an examination of those statewide races that will be eligible
for public financing, and be it further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the commission is
encouraged to seek the assistance of the political science departments at Vermont
institutions of higher education, and be it further <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the commission is
encouraged to conduct mock elections, utilizing a preference voting system, and be it
further <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the commission shall
report its findings and recommendations, including any draft legislation that it deems
necessary to implement its recommendations, to the house of representatives by January 15,
1999, and be it further<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the members of the
commission shall not be entitled to per diem compensation nor expenses from the state of
Vermont in connection with their duties, and be it further <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Resolved</u>: That the Clerk of the
House be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of State, Vermont
Common Cause and the Vermont League of Women Voters. </small></p>
