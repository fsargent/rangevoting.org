<H2> CRV correction to Vermont report's "<a href="07sincere.htm">section 7</a>"  </H2>

<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"This is not a difficulty with systems such as IRV, however, since voters who select second or subsequent choices will not thereby help defeat their first choice."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
This is actually very very carefully worded so that it is technically true.
However, it is misleading.  First of all, in IRV, voters who vote for 
their <i>first</i> choice, can thereby 
cause him to lose. (<a href="../IRVpartic.html">Example</a>)
Don't you think that is a slightly more serious problem than voters who 
(optionally) describe their second choice, possibly hurting their first?
</p>
<p>
Second, the Vermont Report's quote leaves readers with the mistaken impression that
specifying 2nd choices can never hurt you in IRV, so voters should happily do it.
In fact this election <a href="../rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">example</a> (see note 2 there)
shows that IRV voters, by foolishly mentioning their honest second choice, can cause
their <i>most-hated</i> candidate to be elected.  If they had refused to specify a second choice,
then the election winner would have been better in their view.
