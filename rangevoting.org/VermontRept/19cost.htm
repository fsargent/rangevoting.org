<p>As proposed, for exclusively statewide races, there would be no changes for town clerks
or local election officials. If the first-choice votes result in majorities in an
election, then this new system costs nothing. If some race requires instant runoff
tabulations, the cost is the same as a recount — just the minor cost of transporting
the ballots to Montpelier and the retabulation — much cheaper and easier than a
traditional runoff election.</p>

<p>There would be some small transition costs, including redesigning and testing the
ballot before actual use, as well as a voter education campaign on how to use the new
ballot. The cost of an education campaign should be small since public service
announcements will certainly be made available by Vermont media. If the state spent a
fraction of what it spends on promoting the lottery, to strengthen our democracy, this
Commission believes it would be money well spent.</p>
