<p>For state elections, there is certainly no federal restriction. Many states and
municipalities have used a variety of preference voting systems. But what about
Vermont&#146;s federal elections, President/Vice president electors, U.S. Senators, and
U.S. Representative? Is there a federal restriction on voting systems? There are some
regulations, but none that would preclude IRV.</p>

<p>The constitutional requirements are few. They include: The requirement that Congress be
chosen by the citizenry (Article I sec. 2: states &quot;The House of Representatives shall
be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several
States...&quot;); that the state legislatures shall decide the voting system subject to
override by Congress (Article I sec. 4: states &quot;The Times, Places and Manner of
holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by
the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
Regulations, except as to the Place of chusing [sic] Senators.&quot;); that Congress shall
rule on disputes over an election of a member (Article I sec. 5: &quot;Each House shall be
the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members...&quot;); the
voting system for selecting members of the electoral college is solely the responsibility
of the state legislature except as to the timing, (Article II sec. 1: The President and
Vice-President shall &quot;be elected as follows Each State shall appoint, in such manner
as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to [the number of
Representatives and Senators combined]...The Congress may determine the Time of chusing
[sic] the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be
the same throughout the United States.&quot;).</p>

<p>There are only two restrictions Congress has applied to how states conduct federal
elections. The first restriction is a prohibition against electing U.S. Representatives
from at-large districts of more than one seat. This is irrelevant for Vermont, as we
currently have only one Representative, although that number is not set in the
Constitution and could be raised by a change in the law that put a cap on the size of the
House. The second restriction is an 1872 law that prohibits any state from holding a
decisive election for a <i>federal</i> office on any date prior to the national date. This
law was cited when the Supreme Court threw out a Louisiana voting system used from 1975
till this year, wherein an open, unitary primary, allowed a winner with more than 50% of
the total vote to be declared elected in October without any November election. Neither of
these restrictions would have any impact on Vermont&#146;s adopting IRV. </p>
