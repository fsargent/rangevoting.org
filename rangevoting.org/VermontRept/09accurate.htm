<p>There are two sides to a voter&#146;s &quot;will&quot; in a single seat election with
more than two candidates. The first is that which the voter most wants, a favorite
candidate, and may be called &quot;sympathy.&quot; The second is that which the voter most
dreads, a candidate the voter wishes to defeat, and may be called &quot;antipathy.&quot;
Under our current system some voters can roll their sympathy and antipathy into a single
vote for a favorite candidate. However, other voters are limited to expressing only one
side of their &quot;will,&quot; and must choose. We don't know which aspect of the
voters&#146; &quot;will&quot; voters are expressing. Did voters really like candidate A,
or did they feel forced into voting for A even though they preferred B, because they
believed a vote for B would serve to help elect candidate C, due to splitting the vote?
<a href="CORR08wasted.html#mlq2"><font color="green">
IRV frees all voters to fully and honestly express their honest will, both as to what they
really want and what they will settle for, to avoid getting what they loathe.</font></a> 
By so doing,
IRV more accurately reflects the collective voters&#146; will, with a decision that fully
incorporates both voters&#146; sympathy and antipathy.</p>
