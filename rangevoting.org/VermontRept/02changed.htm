<p>Vermont has changed both its voting system and majority requirements many times through
its history. The acceptance of initial plurality winners is actually a rather recent
change in Vermont election law. The majority requirement was finally abandoned altogether
for all offices other than constitutional ones only in 1940. For most of Vermont&#146;s
history, all single-seat races required a majority to elect. In cases without an initial
majority winner for a legislative seat, if there was no majority a new vote was held,
repeatedly, until a majority was achieved. For Congress, this meant elections a month or
so apart. For state representatives, it meant re-voting on into the night or the next day
at a town meeting. Eventually, plurality victories were recognized if there was no
majority winner after a few re-votes. This shift to the plurality rule came in the midst
of a period of one-party predominance in which no statewide election was won by any
candidate other than a Republican for over a century.</p>

<p>Changes in voting procedure have also been notable, although most of the changes
occurred prior to this century. These changes include the allowance of printed ballots
rather than written ballots, the usage of absentee ballots, and the introduction of the
Australian ballot or government-printed ballot. The only major change in this century was
the adoption of state sponsored party primaries in 1915.</p>

<p>As state archivist Gregory Sanford noted in his testimony to the Commission, Vermont
has continually changed its voting system in response to political stimuli.
