<H2> CRV correction to Vermont report's <a href="18unbiased.htm">section 18</a> 
</H2>

<p><b>Misleading quotes:</b> <a name="minor">
"IRV does not favor or hurt any particular group...
This reform does not give advantage or disadvantage to
... major parties or minor parties."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
This is simply flat-out false.  IRV
<a href="../TarrIrv.html#facts">has led</a>, in every country that has used it,
to self-reinforcing 2-party domination, same as with plurality voting.
This is agreed by analysts in those countries.  It is not in dispute.
It is particularly clear in <a href="../AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>
(whose house is 2-party dominated since it uses IRV, but
whose senate is not, since it does not use IRV) and
<a href="../MaltaPol.html">Malta</a> (massive 2-party domination)
which are the two countries with the greatest historical experience using IRV.
Indeed
according to the Australian analysts at
<a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml">
http://www.australianpolitics.com/voting/systems/preferential.shtml</a>
(Australia is the country with the most IRV experience)
the "disadvantages of the Preferential [IRV] System"
include "it <i>promotes a two-party system</i> to the detriment of minor parties and independents."
And see, e.g.
<a href="../Karvonen.html">this paper</a>.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the <i>two-riound</I> runoff system <i>does</i> permit more than 2 parties to 
stably exist (cf. France, many South American countries), which is an example of how 
subtle changes in voting method can favor minor parties a lot more...

<a name="mlq2">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"Voters have every incentive to vote their true beliefs"
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
In fact this election <a href="../IRVpartic.html">example</a> 
shows that IRV voters, by foolishly voting honestly, 
can cause their most-hated last-ranked candidate to get elected, 
whereas if they'd refused to vote, a different (hence better in their eyes)
candidate would have won.
</p>

<a name="mlq3">
<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"There also is no reason for voters not to rank as many candidates as they want"
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
In fact this election <a href="../rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">example</a> (see note 2 there)
shows that IRV voters, by foolishly mentioning their honest second choice, can cause
their <i>most-hated</i> candidate to be elected.  If they had refused to specify a second choice,
then the election winner would have been better in their view.
