<p>Some might worry that the retabulation of ballots will require local polling officials
to stay up late into the night and impose an unreasonable burden. As proposed in H.665,
none of the new retabulation responsibilities would be placed on local polling officials.
They would do nothing differently than they do currently: counting first-choice
preferences and reporting to the Secretary of State. There is no need to buy any new vote
tabulating machines. All of the &quot;complex&quot; elements of IRV are proposed to be
handled like a statewide recount: by a committee appointed by the court, sometime after
the voting day. These &quot;complexities&quot; only come into play when there is no
majority first-choice winner. In elections with an initial majority winner, there is no
administrative burden or even cost in using IRV.</p>

<p>Recognizing that IRV for statewide races will cause no increased workload for local
polling officials, John Cushing, chair of the legislative committee of the Vermont Town
Clerk and Treasurers Association, testified to the House Local Government Committee that
they have no problem with such a reform. Speaking personally, Mr. Cushing said he favored
IRV since it keeps the election of the Governor &quot;in the hands of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>Poll workers will likely need to answer more questions than usual during the first
couple of elections using new IRV ballots. The voter education campaign, with sample
ballots, would probably need to extend through the election day.</p>
