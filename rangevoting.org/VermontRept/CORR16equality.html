<H2> Corrections to Vermont report's "<a href="16equality.htm">section 16</a>"  </H2>

<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"Another related confusion has to do with the notion that if low-ranking candidates were dropped in some different order, their ballot transfers could produce a different winner. This is not true."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
That was a lie.
Well, there is the problem that it is <i>impossible</i> under the rules of IRV to
"drop candidates in a different order" since the IRV rules themselves
specify the order except if there is a tie.  
So even talking about this is, technically, ludicrous.
However, since the Vermont report insists on talking about it, let us consider
the case where at some round there is an <i>exact tie</i> between two candidates
being considered for elimination (both of whom have no hope of winning),
and then consider the consequences of eliminating one rather than the other.
Does it matter?  Or will the other just be eliminated next round so it will not
matter and either way we get the same winner at the end of the day?
</p>
<p>
The answer is, if <i>does matter</i> and the order in which you choose to
eliminate the "no hopers" <i>can</i> affect the winner.
Here is an example:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 120 </td>
<td> A>? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 150 </td>
<td> B>A>? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 100 </td>
<td> C>B>? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 100 </td>
<td> D>C>? </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In this 470-voter election, there is an exact tie between C and D for last place in
the top-rank vote count.  (It does not matter what preference happen inside
the parts of the votes marked "?", since IRV ignores whatever those
parts of the votes say.)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Suppose we decide to eliminate D.  Then
100 votes transfer to C, causing B to lose the next round,
whereupon <b>A wins</b> the election 270 to 200 over C.
</li>
<li>
But suppose we instead had decided to eliminate C.  
Then 100 votes transfer to B.  Then D is eliminated, then <b>B wins</b>
the election 250 to 120 over A (actually the 250 and 120 will have whatever
amounts of D-votes transferred to them added on, but whatever those amounts are does not matter
&ndash; B wins regardless.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Not only that, but you can set up "amplifying cascade" scenarios where <i>tiny</i> changes in
the votes for the wacko no-hope fringe candidates, end up having 
<i>enormous</i> effects on the vote counts for the final winners.
Dummett in his book <i>Voting Procedures</i> (Oxford Univ. Press) calls this "chaos."
</p>

<p>
And ties can be quite common among the low-vote-getters so this is not at all an 
unrealistic scenario.  For example in the CA gubernatorial recall election of 2003,<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  D. (Logan Darrow) Clements   got  274  votes, beating   Robert A. Dole's  273.<br>
Then later on in the same election,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Scott W. Davis               got  382 votes, beating    Daniel W. Richards's 381.<br>
Then later on in the same election,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Paul W. Vann        got 452 and   Michael Cheli 451 votes.<br>
Then later on in the same election,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Kelly P. Kimball  got  582  and  Mike McNeilly  581 votes.<br>
Then later on in the same election,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Christopher Ranken got  822  and  Sharon Rushford 821 votes.<br>
</blockquote>
Have you had enough yet?    Eventually Schwarzenegger won.
Oh, was that what you wanted to know?
</p>

<p><b>Misleading quote:</b>
"Every voter has exactly the same clout with IRV."
</p>
<p>
<b>Correction:</b>
Since "clout" is not formally defined, this sentence
could be defended as not, strictly speaking,
"false" but rather
"meaningless."  However
<a href="../rangeVirv.html#nasty">this example election</a>
shows a scenario in which 102 voters say "D>C" while 201 voters 
say "C>D" but <i>D wins</I> the election!?!  Why?  Well, evidently some IRV
voters are more equal than others...  the 102 voters here get noticed
but the 201 do not.   More precisely, as is explained in the commentary to
that election-example, IRV chooses to <i>ignore</i> parts of the votes but not
other parts, causing D to beat C in the non-ignored parts of the votes.
