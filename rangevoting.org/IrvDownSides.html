<H2> Major downsides for the Democrat and Republican party officials considering changing
Iowa Caucus rules to Range or IRV voting </H2>

<p>
IRV suffers several downside risks that Range does not:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
 IRV increases the risk of tied-election nightmares like in Florida 2000
(whereas range <i>de</i>creases that risk);
</li>
<li>
 IRV leads to great logistical problems and time-delays as in
<a href="rangeVirv.html#SanF">San Francisco</a>; Range is simple and far superior for
hand calculation statewide done in precincts;
</li>
<li>
 IRV leads to <a href="UniqBest.html">less winner-quality on average</a> than Range.
Including in <a href="IowaSumm.html#ComputerSim">computer simulations specifically 
intended to resemble Iowa</a>.)
In contrast, Range voting exhibits no downside risks from the point of view
of those decision makers.  Why try to push a worse system on decision makers
who'll want it less?
</li>
</ol>
