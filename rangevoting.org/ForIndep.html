<H2> Why Unaffiliated voters need range voting </H2>

<p>
If you are unaffiliated with any major party, guess what &ndash; about one-third of
American registered voters are just like you!  That tells me something!
It tells me that a heck of a lot of voters are pretty disgusted with the 
top 2 parties and the limited options they represent.  So hugely disgusted they are willing
to voluntarily reduce their own voting power (since cannot vote in a party primary
unless affiliated, in most states) to say so.
</P>

<p> 
And there is good reason for that disgust.  The 
two-party "<a href="Duverger.html">duopoly</a>" has reigned since 1824.
And in that time, guess what happened?  Almost complete lack of representation of minority
views and ethnicities (or in the case of women, a <i>maj</i>ority is shut out), that is what.
</P>

<!-- http://bioguide.congress.gov/congresswomen/index.asp  203 women have been elected US House ever -->
<p>
If you are a woman, you get better parliamentary representation in Pakistan and Rwanda 
than the USA.  (Don't some
trends in this table more resemble what you would expect from a "monarchy"
than a "democracy"?)
</P>

<p>
And suppose you happen to be against the Iraq war?  (And according to the latest polls,
as of 2005, 
a majority of Americans think that war was a "mistake.")
Maybe you think spending $200 <i>billion</i> per year on an Iraq war based
on a fantasy &ndash; including $28 billion
just on the US <i>embassy</i> there (world's largest embassy) &ndash; was not incredibly
wise when you consider that meanwhile, for 5 consecutive years,
Bush and Congress by bipartisan budget vote
<a href="NewOrleansBudget.html">turned down</a>
Louisiana's requests for mere tens of <i>millions</i>
per year in more flood control money to protect the city of
New Orleans.  (Apparently, protecting New Orleans was worth about a thousand times less
than that embassy.)  And meanwhile over a third of the Louisiana National Guard
(and even higher percentage of Mississippi's) were 7000 miles away in Iraq
where they were unable to help with
the Hurricane Katrina disaster.  (That's an even bigger loss than the 
raw numbers suggest because many of these part-time soldiers had to leave
their full-time police, fire department, and paramedic jobs behind.)
</p>

<p>
Or maybe you favor a balanced budget?
Sorry &ndash; <i>both</i> the Democrats and Republicans voted for the war and for the tax cuts
during that war and budget deficit period.
What if you are against the "PATRIOT act"? 
Sorry &ndash; <i>both</i> the Democrats and Republicans voted for it.  (In fact John Kerry,
later to be the Democratic presidential candidate, <i>cosponsored</i> it.)
<i> Where is your choice? </i>
OK, what if you want to get rid of outrageous "pork" spending and government subsidies?
Need I say more?
</p>

<p> 
And suppose you are right-to-life (anti-abortion) <i>but</i> you are not in favor of
eliminating the "estate tax"
on  inheritances in the 98th percentile and above in size
so wealthy fat cats can leave huge
inheritances tax-free while those of us who actually work for a living
have to pay taxes?  Sorry, you can get <i>one</i> of those views from the two major
party platforms right now, but not the other view at the same time &ndash; pick
your poison.  Why can't you find a party
that thinks your way on both issues?  Wouldn't a <i>real</i> democracy offer you that
kind of choice somewhere?
</P>

<p>
Right now you are suffering from a lack of acceptable choices.
You can't go with the major parties because they are shutting your viewpoint out.
You can't go with the minor parties because the system is rigged so they
have no chance.
The USA's "democracy" has left you out in the cold.
</P>

<p>
You want a system that will allow <i>more than two</i> parties to exist, 
(which no longer must only be fringe and fanatical),
with more points of view,
and without artificial forces that lead to permanent duopoly domination.
You want to be able to express your point of view in your vote to try to get
what you want, as opposed to being forced into one of
two very-ill-fitting boxes, neither of which is what you want.
And you want to express your view about <i>all</i> of those candidates so even if it does come
down to two candidates you don't like terribly, you still have some say about them.
</P>

<p>
Seems to us, range voting is for you.
