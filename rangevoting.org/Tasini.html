<H2> Jonathan Tasini &ndash; a particularly blatant example of the "don't got money? Goodbye"
disease in US "democracy" </H2>

<p>
Ex-Union leader and writer
<a href="http://www.tasinifornewyork.org/issues">Jonathan Tasini</a>
qualified (by submitting 
a 40,000-signature petition)
for the New York State
primary ballot as the only challenger to Hillary Clinton in the September 2006
Democratic Party Primary for her current senate seat. 
</p>
<p>
But the local television affiliate of Times Warner, NY1, which is broadcasting debates 
for every other NY-statewide Democratic primary contest, as well 
as the debate for the Republican Senate primary, <i>refused</i> to
broadcast any debates involving Hillary Clinton and Jonathan Tasini. 
(Clinton, did however, appear in a "debate" <i>without</i>
Tasini &ndash; and hence without any 
Democratic Primary rivals whatever.)
</p>
<p>
Why?
</p>
<p>
Tasini met all the criteria to participate in the debate (e.g. polling 13% in a Marist poll,
above the 5% cutoff) <i>except</i> for raising $500,000.  
Tasini vs. Clinton was quite similar to the simultaneous Lamont vs. Lieberman senate primary
race in neighboring Connecticut
(which Lamont won) in all ways <i>except</i> that Lamont had a fortune estimated as
between $90 and $300 million.  That made Lamont "serious" and "worthy of media coverage"
whereas Tasini was essentially entirely blocked out of all New York media
and not allowed in any debate.   In terms of the issues, the two races were very similar &ndash;
the incumbent voted for the Iraq War while the challenger was antiwar, and the challenger
considered that his central issue.
</p>
<p>
However, Hillary Clinton refused to <i>mention</i> the Iraq war in any of her campaign ads
so far (late August 2006) &ndash;
an attempt to avoid the issue which, thanks to Tasini's lack of wealth
and the media's refusal to cover him, so far has been entirely successful.
</p>
<p>
NY1 appears to have set an arbitrary criterion of $500,000 with the sole purpose of 
excluding Tasini.  (The previous year, NY1 had used $50,000.  Tasini had
raised about $150,000 at the time.)
"Coincidentally," the 
Time Warner Political Action Committee gave $4000 in 2003, $1000 in 2004, and 
$5000 in 2005 to Friends of Hillary even though at those times, she had no election
opponents whatever.
