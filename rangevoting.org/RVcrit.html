<H2> Criticisms of Range Voting </H2>
<p>
Many criticisms have been made of <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a>
voting (and of its simpler variant
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting), but most are just
consequences of misunderstanding &ndash;
for example, worries about Range Voting's
<a href="ConstVt.html">constitutionality</a>,
<a href="Complexity.html">simplicity</a>,
or
<a href="VMSumm.html">voting-machine compatibility</a>;
or the
<a href="BulletBugaboo.html">Bullet voting bugaboo</a>;
or
<a href="Irvtalk.html">mistaken beliefs</a>
about competing voting systems.
</p>
<p>
Here are several examples of such criticisms of range voting, written by
<ol>
<li>
<a href="Lorenzo.html">Anthony J. Lorenzo</a> of the 
Florida-based 
Coalition for Instant Runoff Voting
<a href="http://www.cirv.org">cirv.org</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="RichieRV.html">Rob Richie</a> of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) 
advocacy group
<a href="http://fairvote.org">fairvote.org</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="RichieOnApproval.html">Richie tries again</a> to criticize approval voting, and 
falls on his face.
</li>
<li>
Retired psychologist and League of Women Voters member
<a href="REisenstadt.html">Jeanne W. Eisenstadt</a> with a psychology-based criticism 
which appears largely invalid although initially it may sound plausible.
</li>
<li>
Somewhat related <a href="MeasTheory.html">criticism</a>  by M.Balinski &amp; R.Laraki
based on "measurement theory."  We completely destroy it.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
However, there are a few <i>genuine</i> criticisms of range voting.
They all seem to be related to <i>strategic voters.</i>
Range voting actually reacts very pleasantly if all the voters
act strategically; one can prove Range Voting
<a href="PleasantSurprise.html">maximizes pleasant surprise</a> 
and
<a href="AppCW.html">elects "beats-all" winners</a> whenever they would exist
with honest voters
(both under <i>plausible assumptions</I> about how the strategic voters behave).
And range voters in 3-candidate elections can always be "semi-honest"
(i.e. never say A>B if they believe B>A)
without ever sacrificing any strategic oomph; and range voters can avoid ever
rating their true favorite below somebody else &ndash; again
without ever sacrificing any strategic oomph.
We're unaware of <i>any</i> comparable package of theorems showing nice behavior with strategic
voters for any non-range voting system.
</p><p>
Also, strategy in range voting is
<i>simple</i>
compared to in many other systems;
see <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p40">puzzle 40</a>
for a theorem showing that that the best strategy for group of co-feeling voters
can <i>fail</i> to be "all vote the same way" in Approval, Borda, Schulze-Condorcet,
and IRV voting, whereas with range voting the best strategy for the group is
always simply to pick the best vote, and then everybody casts it.
</p>
<p>
So what, then, is the criticism?
The problems for Range Voting arise when either
<ol>
<li>
<i>Not</i> all of the Range Voters &ndash; only <i>some</i> &ndash;
vote strategically; and in a way <i>correlated</i> to their politics. 
If for example, voters preferring A over B express intense
opinions, but those preferring B over A express mild opinions, then
A can win the election, thus "penalizing" the B-voters for their "honesty."
To this we reply that it is <i>naive</i> to believe that only one side will employ
strategic exaggeration in votes; if one does, the other will too.  Further, even if that did
happen, it would tend to be self-correcting over time.  Further, the mild-opinioned
voters have little basis for complaining, since their preferences were only mild
and since they <i>voluntarily chose</i> to express them.   (The more mild their opinions, the more
likely such a strategy will work against them &ndash; but the less it matters!)
Here is a <a href="TidemanCrit.html">succinct statement by Professor T.N.Tideman</a>
of the criticism, and responses by <a href="TidemanRespB.html">Kok</a>
and <a href="TidemanRespA.html">Lomax</a>, and finally a response based on
<a href="StratHonMix.html">ongoing computer simulations</a>, which seem
to prove that (surprisingly) this whole concern is actually <i>not</i> a concern; even if
the worst fears of the critic here come true, then range <i>still</i> is superior
to IRV, Condorcet methods, etc.  Also see the
<a href="ShExpRes.html">other set of computer simulations</a>.
</li><li>
Or when the "plausible assumptions" we alluded to above
are violated &ndash; because the voters try to be strategic <i>but</i>
do not have enough knowledge to do so intelligently enough.
Chris Benham has given a <a href="RVstrat4.html">nasty example</a>
illustrating how range voters (by trying to be strategic without enough 
understanding of the situation) can backfire badly.  Fortunately,
<a href="UniqBest.html">computer simulations</a>
of <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>
indicate that Benham-type scenarios arise rarely enough, and/or
are not severe enough often enough, so that Range Voting still seems to be
the best method among all common proposals <i>on average</i>.
Also, in our <a href="RVstrat4.html">detailed discussion</a> of the Benham example
we explain why it depended on ill-informed voters, and show that
if those voters had been a little better-informed, they would not have fallen
into Benham's strategic-voting trap.  An even-nastier trap is, however,
stated which is not so easily escaped, but it is more complicated than, and presumably
a lot rarer than, Benham's example.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Finally, one can argue (with at least <i>some</I> validity) that range voting
<a href="RVstrat6.html#lesson">helps</a> 
naive
too-honest voters more than it victimizes them.
