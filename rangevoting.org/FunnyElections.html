How much damage and distortion of history
is being caused by the use of poor voting systems?
Assess for yourself...  we list a large number of 
elections in which poor voting systems such as <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>
yielded the wrong winner.   This has nothing necessarily to do 
with <a href="PresFraud.html">fraud</a> or fakery;
it is purely a matter of the <i>mathematical properties</i> of good and bad voting systems.
The plurality voting system used in the USA is well known to be among the worst
while <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> is one of the best.

The Green Party's Alexander Van der Bellen
won with about 53.3% of the vote in the head-to-head runoff
versus Norbert Hofer (Freedom Party) a right-wing party
which has been accused of being neo-Nazi.
This seems to be the first time a "Green" 
Party has won a national presidency by direct popular vote,
and the second Green president after
Raimonds V&euml;jonis of Latvia.
</td>

We have no dispute with the winner, but merely wish
to point out that Hofer
got by far the most votes (35%) in the first-round election, 
(Van der Bellen 21%, Irmgard Griss 19%, Rudolf Hundstorfer 11%,
Andreas Khol 11%, Richard Lugner 2%) and therefore would have won
without runoff.  (It is conceivable Griss would have defeated
Hofer and V.d.Bellen in head-to-head runoffs, but if so she never
got the opportunity.)

Trump won with "electoral vote,"
but lost to Hillary Clinton(Dem)
using "popular vote" &ndash; and by the largest margin (2%=2.6 million) of
any elected president.  Meanwhile Gary Johnson(Liber) got only 3.3% of
the vote.  Instant Runoff would not have altered those results.
But with <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a>
voting any of {Johnson, Trump, H.Clinton} 
would have won the general election; too close to call to say which;
and with <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting Clinton would have won.  
If we got rid of the "primary/general" split, then the winner with
approval would have been Bernie Sanders, and with score would have been
either Sanders or John Kasich(Repub).  If either the Republican
or Democratic Party had run its primaries with approval voting
and allowed Independents to vote in them, then they would
have assured winning the presidency, and that president would
have been (respectively) Kasich and Sanders.

most popular party), kicking
out the Tories, led by Stephen Harper.

Brian Goldman asked 
how much a different voting system could have changed the election outcome:
"The best measure I could come up with using available data was 
'How many seats were won without a majority?' The answer is: 'most of them':

The Tories led by David Cameron unexpectedly retained power by winning 331/650 seats.

It's unclear to me whether the Tories deserved power (close call), 
but it is clear that this election
was grossly disproportional, with some parties winning over 100 times as many seats per
vote, as others that got comparable or larger numbers of votes.
This suggests that Britain would be better off if it incorporated a proportional
system to elect at least part of its government (e.g. like the German system, or
<a href="Asset.html">asset voting</a>) or if it 
switched to <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, a superior single-winner system.

claiming it would probably again be fraudulent.

The first round (22 April) was won by N.Sarkozy with 31.2%
followed by S.Royal with 25.9%.  These two advanced to the second and final round.
The third-place finisher, F.Bayrou, with 18.6% of the vote &ndash; and all the further
even-worse finishers &ndash; were eliminated. The <i>New York Times</i>
described Sarkozy as "rightist," Bayrou as "centrist," and Royal as "leftist."
Finally, in the second round (5 May), Sarkozy won. 
</td>
<td>
According to an IPSOS poll ending 21 April, Bayrou would have beaten Sarkozy in a head-to-head
(i.e. potential second-round) election by 52.5% to 47.5%, and this conclusion
was true no matter what time the poll was taken from early March until late April.
According to a CSA poll ending 20 April, a head-to-head Sarkozy v. Royal matchup &ndash;
which in fact happened &ndash; would be a tossup (50%-50%), while the IFOP poll 
(also ending 20 April) gave a 51-49 edge to Sarkozy.  The IFOP poll also indicated Bayrou would
have beaten Sarkozy 55-45 head to head, and Bayrou would have beaten Royal 58-42 head-to-head.
At least 9 other polls also examined a possible Bayrou-Sarkozy runoff 
and all also concluded Bayrou would win it.
From these polls we conclude that <b>Bayrou</b> would have beaten either major opponent
in a head to head contest and thus was the Condorcet winner. 
However, Bayrou was eliminated
in the first round, in a <i>clear failure</i>
of France's plurality+top2runoff system.  The same pathology
would also have happened with &quot;<a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff</a>&quot;
at least if we restrict attention to
the (31.2+25.9+18.6=75.7)% 
of the electorate who voted for these three only (because in a 3-candidate
election with self-consistent voters, plurality+top2runoff and IRV are the same thing).
Indeed an IRV exit-poll study shows
IRV would have behaved almost exactly the same as the official
election, also electing Sarkozy.
Range voting apparently would have elected Bayrou as was shown by 
the <a href="OrsayTable.html">results</a> of

It was generally suspected that Ortega
would have lost in a runoff.  Indeed quite possibly Ortega would have lost
to <i>any</i> of his 4 major rivals in a runoff (i.e. Ortega was the

R.Madrazo might have won (because the rightist Calderon voters
would have preferred him as the "lesser evil" over the leftist Obrador,
whereas the leftist Obrador voters might similarly have preferred Madrazo
over Calderon, so that Madrazo in net would be preferred pairwise
over every opponent).  In view of both of these 
possibilities (<a href="Mexico06.html">more details</a>)
it is very likely Calderon's victory was merely an artifact of the plurality system.

(Boanareke Boanareke and Beniamina Tinga) simply returned to their home islands,
where they remained until election day. They did not campaign and were not regarded as
serious candidates." This process illustrates
a clear case of strategic manipulation of the Borda count at work.
As leaders of their respective parties, Teburoro Tito and Tewareka Tentoa were two of the
more popular politicians throughout Kiribati, and their elimination from the
presidential contest was a surprise to many voters.
By contrast, two of the nominated contestants were comparatively not serious and
together received less than 10 percent of the vote at the resulting
presidential election, won by Teatao Teannaki.
As Van Trease commented, "It remains to be seen just how long such a system will be
tolerated which has the effect of eliminating popular candidates through backroom
political maneuvering."

In this election, conducted with the <a href="rangeVirv.html">instant runoff (IRV)</a>

Lenihan, however, would have
won had the election been conducted with plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting
(he got 44.1% of the top-rank votes, while the next contender had 38.9%).
Robinson's victory thus depended
on vote transfers from the eliminated Fine Gael candidate A.Currie,
whose supporters evidently viewed Robinson as the "lesser evil."
<br><br>
But thanks to IRV <a href="Ireland1990.html">pathologies in this election</a>,
Lenihan could have claimed to be the legitimate
winner: 
<ol>
<li>
If a whole new county had magically appeared, all of them supporting Lenihan's

(b) exhibiting <a href="Ireland1990.html">several pathologies</a> including
<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a>.
Generally speaking, IRV leads to 2-party domination,
just like plurality.  And <a href="Ireland2002.html">indeed</a>, 
in every Irish presidential election besides 1990,
the Fianna Fail party's candidate always won, despite the fact that Ireland as a 
<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a> country had more than two parties.  
This 1990 election seems to indicate that IRV, despite leading to 2-party domination, does
so with somewhat less oomph than plurality voting and hence permits a third-party
candidate to win in exceptional circumstances.
These certainly <i>were</i> exceptional circumstances:
<ol>
<li>
Mary Robinson enjoyed worldwide fame and respect (winner of Nobel Peace prize)
</li>
<li>
The FF candidate Lenihan was afflicted by two scandals: 
(a) scandal involving PM Charles Haughey and phone tapping/jamming, and
(b) was caught lying about that on tape,
</li>
<li>
Unusually, the Fine Gael party failed to put forward a credible candidate
(both their top choices FitzGerald and Barry
declined to run; Currie had only been a member of the Dail 
since 1989).
</li>

Even all these factors together were not enough to 
overcome <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger's law</a>

Further, because the Socialist Allan L. Benson

effect which tended to cancel
out Hanly's anti-Hughes effect,
that's more reason to regard Wilson as the "right" winner despite Hanly being a spoiler
considered alone.
(An October poll of Labor leaders found they thought most
of their members would vote Wilson.)
<b>Summary:</b> Hanly was a spoiler for Hughes; Hughes would have won if Hanly had not run.
But nevertheless in a larger democratic sense we would contend Wilson was the "right" winner
based on those voters at that time.
<b>Postscript [from Richard Winger]:</b> 
Republicans in Congress passed the Constitutional amendment in 1917 to
impose nationwide prohibition of alcoholic beverages. The proposal had
been introduced in every Congress starting in 1875, but had never come
close to passing by the necessary two-thirds majority. But the
Republicans (who generally gave prohibition lip service but never actually did much), 
having lost two presidential elections due to Prohibition
Party spoilers, decided to end that problem once and for all, by accepting the
amendment and thus killing the rationale for the Prohibition Party to
continue to exist. 
(It worked: Hanly was the last Prohibition Party candidate to get substantial votes.)
Prohibition turned out to be a massive failure and was repealed in 1933.
Thus, in one of the few known instances where a major party pandered to a minor party
to prevent its spoiler effect, the result was a huge national failure.

But (Richard Winger points out) even if 100% of the Breckinridge and Bell votes
shifted to Douglas, giving him an enormous 60.2% to 39.8% popular-vote victory over
Lincoln (equivalent to the third-biggest "landslide" in US history up to 2005), then <i>still</i>
Lincoln would have won the presidency by at least 173-to-130 electoral votes,
due to the electoral college system and the geographic
distribution of the voters! 
<br>
<small>
Note: A.Tabarrok &amp; L.Spector: <i>Would the Borda Count Have Avoided the Civil War?</i>
J. of Theoretical Politics 11,2 (April 1999) 261-286 also examined this and
concluded Lincoln was a wrong-winner and Douglas 
a right-winner:
"By comparing the outcome under plurality rule to the outcomes which would have 
occurred under other voting systems, we conclude that Stephen Douglas, not Lincoln, 
was plausibly the candidate who best represented the preferences of the voters."
That quote is wrong in the sense that Lincoln's victory cannot be questioned unless you
question the legitimacy of the electoral college.  Just winning the North <i>alone</i> was enough
electoral votes for the presidency.
Lincoln wrote off the South as a lost cause, in
some Southern states neglecting even to <i>print ballots</i> (at that time, campaigns 
printed and distributed their candidate's ballots)!

However, in all this it should be noted
that if slaves had had the right to vote, the numbers would have changed substantially.

<td> USA 1848 Presidential </td>

General Zachary Taylor(Whig) won.
His opposition was split between Lewis Cass(Dem) and Martin Van Buren (former Dem president
who did not get their nomination and therefore ran on the Free Soil more-antislavery ticket).
Taylor died 16 months after his election and was supplanted by his 
vice-president Millard Fillmore.
</td>
<td> 
Van Buren's vote count was 2.1 times larger than the Taylor-over-Cass margin, and
probably most of his voters would have preferred Cass over Taylor.
(Taylor was a malleable non-politician who'd never held elected office,
nor even voted, before.  He'd gotten good press in the Mexican war and had the right relatives.)
However, due to the distributions of voters with respect to the electoral college, having a voting
system immune to vote splitting probably still would have failed to elect Cass.
If the USA had had <i>both</i> a good voting system <i>and</i> straight
popular vote for president
(i.e. no electoral college), <i>then</i> it becomes at least plausible 
Taylor would have lost (a 74-26 split of the Van Buren voters for Cass over Taylor would
have sufficed).

<td> USA 1844 Presidential </td>

James Polk(Dem) won with 49.54% of the popular vote, beating Henry Clay(Whig)'s 48.08%.
But Clay would have won if he had gotten New York's 36 electoral votes,
but did not thanks to the Liberty Party's "spoiler" antislavery
candidate James Birney (2.30%).  The antislavery candidate thus managed to get Polk (a slave-owner)
elected.
</td>
<td> 
Clay lost New York by 5106 votes while Birney got 15812 New York votes.
It is plausible the Birney voters predominantly
would have considered Clay the lesser of two evils
since he was slightly less pro-slavery than Polk (e.g. did not recommend admitting 
Texas as a slave state).
If that happened in at least a 2:1 ratio (which is at least plausible) then
Clay would have won if New York had used
IRV, Plurality with separate top-2 runoff, range, approval, or Condorcet.

S.E.Morison: <i>Oxford History of the American People</i> 1965, p.557:
"...the expansionists trotted out the first `dark horse' in American history.  His
name, new to most of the country, was James K. Polk... Clay... received the Whig
nomination by acclamation... but... enough antislavery Whigs
voted for Birney, the abolitionist candidate in New York, to give Polk a slight edge..."

J.Q.Adams won with 30.9% of the popular vote,
beating Andrew Jackson (41.3%), Henry Clay (13.0%), and W.H.Crawford (11.2%)
thanks to deals in the US House of Representatives, into which the election fell
after nobody got a clear majority.  
(Re these numbers: yes, Adams apparently did win with fewer votes;
<i>but</i> since about a quarter of the states did not use popular vote at the time, 
this is not completely clear.  Only two states did not use popular vote in 1828,
which thus is the first year in which "popular vote" had a reasonably clear meaning.
The two holdouts were Delaware and S.Carolina, which converted to popular in 1832 and after
the Civil War, respectively.)
</td>
<td> 
Unclear.  In elections of this nature, a top-2 runoff would have yielded a
hard-to-dispute winner, but was never conducted so we shall never know.
Jackson recontested Adams in 1828 and won by a large margin, so it is
plausible it should have been Jackson.

<H3> Conclusions </H3>
<p>
These "direct effects" (i.e. wrong election winners) are only the tip of the iceberg of
the enormous damage caused by the flawed plurality voting system.
There is also enormous "indirect damage" caused by candidates who don't even <i>run</i>
because they are afraid of causing a spoiler pathology (like these),
or because of <a href="Duverger.html">2-party</a> or <a href="OneParty.html">1-party</a>
domination (a bad voter-choice-denying side effect of the plurality voting system)
causing their chances to
be <a href="Strangle.html">minuscule</a>.  You can see the 
enormous distortions caused by the Plurality system in
<a href="PsEl04.html">these numbers</a>.
</p>

<p>
It seems clear from the above that adding a <b>delayed runoff round</b> to the 
single-round plurality system yields an <b>improvement</b>:  There are at least a dozen
(and maybe over 20 or even 30)
national presidential elections where it would have yielded (or did yield)
a more-preferred winner.  The <b>instant runoff</b> (IRV)
system has been touted as an even-further
improvement because it supposedly yields the same result, but in only one round
(saving time and money).  However, that is <a href="TTRvsIRVrevdata.html">not</a>
true: it can <i>fail</i> to yield the
same result as a consequence of strategic voting (and on balance, in those cases
we would expect IRV's winner to be worse than delayed runoff's in the 
sense that strategic and honest voting
are <i>identical</i> in the top-2 runoff, but not the same in IRV), 
and it is in some ways <i>more</i> expensive and error
prone (because simple voting machines can be used for plurality but not for IRV elections)
and definitely yields a far higher risk of crisis-inducing near-tie nightmares.
And there is one clear empirical difference &ndash; 
noted by <a href="Duverger.html">Duverger</a>
&ndash;  while plurality-with-delayed-runoff leads to multiparty democracy, IRV
leads to 2-party domination.
</p>

<p>
But the delayed and instant runoff systems are not perfect; 
there are four clear cases (USA 2016, France 2007, Peru 2006, and Chile 1970)
where these systems still yielded the wrong winner, plus three
further cases (France 2002, Slovakia 2004, Cyprus 1988)
where in each there seems about 50% chance delayed-runoff gave the wrong winner (and 
also runoff might have delivered wrong winners in Mexico 2006 and/or Iran 2005).
Also one could find innumerably more examples if one considered races 
lower-level than presidential.  <a name="NYS1970"></a> For example Brams &amp; Fishburn
analyse the 1970 race for New York State's senatorship,
which J.Buckley won with 39% over
R.Ottinger (37%) and C.Goodell (24%).
Their analysis claims Goodell was the <a href="Glossary.html">Condorcet winner</a>
and probably also the approval-voting winner, but instant (or ordinary) runoff 
would not have elected Goodell (and both probably would have elected Buckley just
like the plurality system).
</p>

<p>
We also have examples in Portugal 1986 of the
failure of the <a href="AppExec.html">Approval</a> 
system
and in  Kiribati 1991 of the failure of the <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a> system
(and this failure was so massive and common-seeming it led to
Borda's abandonment) .
</p>

<p>
It seems at least plausible (although there is no way to prove it) that <b>range voting</b>
would have given the correct winner in <i>every</i> case tabulated, plus it can be run in
a single round on simple voting machines while <i>reducing</i> tie-risk, 
thus getting the best of all worlds.
</p>

<p>
It is also fairly clear that the USA's <b>electoral college</b> system is a very bad idea.
It pointlessly greatly increases the risk of crisis-inducing near-ties.
It causes presidents to cater only to the interests of a very small number
of "swing states" and to almost completely ignore all the other states.
And it can lead to very crazy results such as Douglas placing far-last in 1860.
It would be far better either to elect the president by straight nationwide popular vote
(and preferably using range voting!) or, if we insist on giving the low-population 
states greater power, then use a <i>weighted</i> nationwide popular vote with
the weights chosen to reflect that state's number of electoral college members.
