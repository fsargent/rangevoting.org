<H2> Examples in which best Range Voting strategy is not "approval style" voting </H2>

<H3> Before we begin... a note about the "generic" situation... </H3>

<p>
..."approval style"
range voting (where you give every candidate either the max or min possible score)
is strategically optimum (or at least, the utility of the best approval-style vote is
only smaller than that of the truly-best range vote by a negligibly small amount)
<i>if</i> we can <i>assume</i> that the probability of an election-leading 
near-tie
(which your vote can hope to alter) between two of the candidates is very unlikely 
and the probability of
a 3-or-more-way near-tie is very <i>very</i>, i.e. neglectibly, unlikely.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Proof sketch: 
We <i>assume</i> your probability of breaking an AB tie is <I>proportional</I> to your 
vote's A-B
score difference.  
Give maximum score to some subset of candidates A and minimum to the complementary subset B.
Why would you want any other vote?  You might want to lower some A's score by
some amount Q if by so doing you
could increase the vote difference for some other pair (or pairs) by Q (in <i>total</i>);
but if that other pair (or pairs) has (have) less
utility
(where "utility" of a pair of candidates
is the probability of that tie times candidate-quality difference)
then that move would be bad for you for <i>any</i> Q>0.  
In other words, assuming situation is "generic" so that <i>exact</I> ties do not happen,
the best maxxing-and-minning-only vote, is in fact your best vote, period.
Hence your best vote (maximizing expected utility)
then  always maxes-out or mins-out
every score you can.  &nbsp; Q.E.D.
</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>A different assumption</i> which also suffices seems to be that the candidates can
be pre-ordered in decreasing likelihood of election chances, and that each's chance is
hugely greater than the next one's.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Proof: 
In this case you can assign your scores to the candidates one by one in order,
only basing your decision on a candidate's score on information about him
and the <i>previous</i>
candidates &ndash; the later ones are irrelevant to that decision.
Then, for each candidate X you score, his score cannot affect the winning
chances of
the previously-scored ones if X does not win.  X's score then
can only affect the chance X wins, not the chances for previous candidates if
X does not win.  And it does so in a monotonic manner.
Hence the decision on X should be purely based on whether X
is superior or inferior in utility to the expected utility among the previous
winners given your previous votes: if it is larger, give X the maximum,
otherwise the minimum score.
Q.E.D.

<b>Forest Simmons</b> also points out the following argument that in "large" elections,
best range voting strategy is approval-style, at least up to statistical "noise"
(which, he argues, ought to be negligibly small in most circumstances in large elections):
</p>
<blockquote>
For each candidate each voter uses dice
to pick a random number between the min and max possible rating, and approves
or disapproves that candidate depending on whether or not the random
number is less than the voter's ideal rating for the candidate.
<br>
According to the "law of large numbers," if all approval voters use
this technique, then the approval proportions for the candidates are
asymptotically the same as the range proportions.
</blockquote>
<p>
But the reader is warned to be careful; this Simmons argument actually does not work
in the large election of <a href="PuzzlePage.html#prob19">puzzle 19</a> because
in that scenario the "noise" would dominate the intentional effects.
</p>
</small>

<p>
However, those assumptions, while plausible in large real
elections, usually are false in small ones.
</p>

<p>
<small>
Also if you have <i>complete knowledge</i> of all the other votes then an optimum range vote
is always trivial to determine, and without loss of generality is an "honest approval-style"
(or one could also demand it be a "plurality-style"), vote.
E.g. give the maximum score to the best candidate who can win and to all better candidates,
and the minimum score to all others.  (This strategy's validity to a large degree
forms the basis for
the "first argument" in the <a href="PleasantSurprise.html">pleasant surprise</a> claim.)

<a name="examples">
<H3> First example: ignorance </H3>
<p>
In a 3-voter (or more voter) [0,1]-range-voting
election, assume the totals of the votes of the other two (or more) voters are either
</p><center>
(1, 1.1, 1.2)
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
or
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
(0, 1.1, 1.2)
</center>
<p>
<i>but</i> you do not know which.
Call the candidates A,B, and C.
Your candidate-utilities: 
<center>
U<sub>A</sub>=10,
&nbsp;
U<sub>B</sub>=5
&nbsp;
U<sub>C</sub>=0.
</center>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you vote (1, 0, 0) approval-style, then A wins in scenario #1 but C wins in scenario #2.
</li>
<li>
If you vote (1, 1, 0) approval-style, then B wins in scenario #2 and B wins in scenario #1.
</li>
<li>
If you vote (1, 1, 1) approval-style, or (0, 0, 0), then C wins in both scenarios.
</li>
<li>
If you vote (1, 0.5, 0), a <i>genuine range vote</i>, 
then A wins in scenario #1 and B wins in scenario #2,
which is the best you can hope for in either case
(and is <i>strictly better</i> than
any approval-style vote)
so that this "honest" vote here also happens to be the strategic vote
giving you the best possible expected utility.
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3> Second example: you, a known, and a random voter </H3>
<p>
In the following 3-voter election,
call the candidates A,B, and C.
We assume [0,1] range voting.
Let R<sub>j</sub> denote independent
uniform random numbers in [0,1], so that voter#2 is regarded as completely unknown to you,
while voter#1 is regarded as completely known.
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> Voter </th>
<th> A </th>
<th> B </th>
<th> C </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> voter#1 </td>
<td> 0 </td>
<td> 0.798 </td>
<td> 0.618 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> voter#2 </td>
<td> R<sub>1</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>2</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>3</sub> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> you(voter#3) </td>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> V </td>
<td> 0 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<small>
(Or, what might be more realistic &ndash; but is entirely equivalent &ndash; is to 
replace voter #2 with <i>three</i> random voters each of whom votes 1 for one candidate,
0 for another, and a random value for the third as 10R, R10, 0R1.)
</small>
Assume the election-utilities (for you) of the
three candidates are    
</p><center>
U<sub>A</sub> = <b>+</b>200,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>B</sub> = <b>+</b>32,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>C</sub> = <b>&ndash;</b>800
</center>
<p>
Then here are the expected utilities of various possible votes you could make
(result of 25 million Monte Carlo experiments):
<small>It is in fact possible to evaluate the exact rational utility answers by evaluating the
volumes of certain 3-dimensional polyhedra, but we did not try.
</small>
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> Vote V </th>
<th> Utility </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1(exaggerated) </td><td> 35.4 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0.83(honest) </td><td> 43.6 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0.58(best?) </td><td> <b>51.2</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0(exaggerated) </td><td> 35.9 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
As you can see, neither the honest range vote, nor either of the two "approval style"
exaggerated ones, is strategically best.  
</p>

<hr>

<H3> Third example: you, a known, and two random voters </H3>
<p>
In the following 4-voter election,
call the candidates A,B, and C.
We assume [0,1] range voting.
Let R<sub>j</sub> denote independent
uniform random numbers in [0,1].
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> Voter </th>
<th> A </th>
<th> B </th>
<th> C </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> voter#1 </td>
<td> 0 </td>
<td> 0.896 </td>
<td> 0.219 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> voter#2 </td>
<td> R<sub>1</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>2</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>3</sub> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> voter#3 </td>
<td> R<sub>4</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>5</sub> </td>
<td> R<sub>6</sub> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> you(voter#4) </td>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> V </td>
<td> 0 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Assume the election-utilities (for you) of the
three candidates are    
<center>
U<sub>A</sub> = <b>+</b>60,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>B</sub> = 0,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;
U<sub>C</sub> = <b>&ndash;</b>940
</center>
Then here are the expected utilities of various possible votes you could make
(result of 25 million Monte Carlo experiments):
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th> Vote V </th>
<th> Utility </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1(exaggerated) </td><td> 3.5 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0.94(honest) </td><td> 4.1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0.46(best?) </td><td> <b>7.8</b> </td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 0(exaggerated) </td><td> 0.9 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Again, neither the honest range vote, nor either of the two "approval style"
exaggerated ones,
is strategically best.
