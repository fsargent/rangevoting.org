RangeVoting.org - Forrester losing NJ governorship 
</title>

<p>
November 2005:
Rich Republican Douglas R. Forrester just lost the NJ governorship to even-richer
Democrat Jon Corzine.
</p>

<p>
Forrester blamed his loss on the fact he was too-associated in the public mind
with President Bush and his failed and unpopular policies, e.g. from the
<i>New York Times</i> (14 Nov. 2005, index-page):
"The chief reason, Mr Forrester said in The Star Ledger of Newark,
is that he belongs to the same party as pres. Bush."
</p>

<p>
My point is, probably a lot of Republicans right now are wishing
they could find a way to abolish any perception of any link between them and
Bush. But they don't have a way to do that. Because there are
only 2 parties and they (or almost all of them) can't become Democrats.
</p>
<p>
If it were politically feasible to split off a viable third party with no cost,
then they'd be happy. 
But they can't.
