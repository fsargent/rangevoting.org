<H2> Tricolor scheme </H2>

<p>
There is a cute (admittedly disgustingly cute) way to check the validity of approval ballots
in Rivest's 3ballot secure voting scheme.  I'm the inventor
and I call it "tricolor."
</p>

<p>
The ballots have punch-outs where voters punch a hole.  
(<small>Hanging chads? Sue me.</small>)
</p>
<p>
We have 3  colors of translucent sheets.
</p>
<p>
The point I'm aiming for, is, if you punched exactly 1 or 2 holes (i.e. exactly
the "valid ways to vote" in Rivest's 3ballot scheme for making approval voting secure) then
stack the 3 ballots on top of each other, then
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Not 3 holes: since obvious no hole goes all the way through all 3 layers.
(Holes could be detected by sticking rods through, electrical contact, etc.)
</li><li>
Not 0 holes since then would be too dark to see through (each
translucent blocks one primary color, all three block all)
</li><li>
1 or 2 holes (valid): permits light to shine through &ndash; perfect.
</li></ol>
<p>
Making sheets chiral shape prevents misorienting before stacking.
The point is, this tricolor invention makes the check so trivial no machine is needed
(or a trivial machine).
<small>[We admit there are useability issues for colorblind voters.]</small>
</p>

<p>
Now (time to get even cleverer), about the copy:
Remember, you've got 3 ballots, red-, blue-, and green-blocking.
You want to copy exactly one, where <i>you</i> (the voter) choose which.
Let's say you chose RED.
Stack on top of each other, and shine a monochromatic RED light through onto
photosensitive copying stuff which senses
light but is colorblind.
Result: the red-blocking ballot gets copied.   Other ballots ignored.
Machine does not know which color you chose (if its sensors really are
colorblind, that is).  
It sucks all 3 of your ballots in as it copies
and checks,
and spits out the copy.  (If check says no good, then all 3 ballots
visibly destroyed in front of you and no copy comes.)
