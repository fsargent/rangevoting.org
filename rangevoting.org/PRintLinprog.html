<p><b>Abstract.</b>
We show how some  proportional representation (PR) election
ideas dating to Lars Edvald <a href="Phragmen.html">Phragmen</a> 1895,
and Bjarke Dahl

in October 2003 can be
written as  solving a mixed linear/integer program (MILP) to optimality
to find the "optimal" PR parliament.
</p>

<h3> The voting system </h3>
<p>
Let C=#candidates, V=#voters, W=#winners, 0&lt;W&lt;C&lt;V.
Let <b>S<sub>v,c</sub></b> be the real-valued <b>score</b> given by voter v to candidate c
on her ballot. 
Consider the bipartite grqph with V red vertices corrsponding to the  V voters
and C blue vertices corresponding to the C candidates.
The edge from voter v to candidate c shall be associated with 
a real variable x<sub>vc</sub>.  There will also be one additional real variable p.
There also will be an <i>integer</i> variable e<sub>c</sub> associated with each candidate c.
Here is a mixed linear/integer program involving those variables.
</p><p>
Linear constraints:
</p><center>
&sum;<sub>1&le;c&le;C</sub>x<sub>vc</sub> &le; p,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&sum;<sub>1&le;v&le;V</sub>x<sub>vc</sub>S<sub>vc</sub>
 = e<sub>c</sub>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&sum;<sub>1&le;c&le;C</sub>e<sub>c</sub> = W,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
0 &le; e<sub>c</sub> &le; 1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;
0 &le; x<sub>vc</sub> &le; 1,
</center><p>
Optimization: minimize p by choice of all the variables.
The W election winners then are the c such that e<sub>c</sub>=1. 
The C-W losers are the c with e<sub>c</sub>=0.
</p><p>
The total number of real variables is VC+1, and of integer variables is C.
The total number of 01-interval-containment linear inequality constraints is 2VC+2C.
The total number of other linear inequality constraints is V.
The total number of linear equality constraints is C+1.
</p><p>
This has formalized a score-using version of Ebert's description of a Phragmen-like system
that is an optimization problem.    (Phragmen's original system was not optimizing anything.)
Ebert has his own PR voting system &ndash; or at least, it is hoped to be PR,
I have not seen any proof that it is, only incompletely convincing heuristic arguments &ndash;
which cannot be formalized in this manner because it would require a <i>non</i>linear 
objective function.   There are many possible nonlinear objective functions.
To explain them, replace the single variable p with V variables p<sub>v</sub>,
replace the first constraint by
</p><center>
&sum;<sub>1&le;c&le;C</sub>x<sub>vc</sub> &le; p<sub>v</sub>,
</center><p>
and replace the optimization goal by "minimize &sum;<sub>1&le;v&le;V</sub>F(p<sub>v</sub>)"
where F is some nonlinear function &ndash; for example Ebert suggested F(x)=x&sup2;
for no particularly convincing reason.
If we use F(x)=x<sup>&mu;</sup> in the limit &mu;&rarr;&infin; then
we get a more-unique version of the "Phragmen" method I began with.
By "more unique" I mean that the method I described could produce ties and
this limit-method  presumably would experience ties less often.
</p>

<h3> Computational complexity </h3>
<p>
I'd guess this program can usually be solved to optimality in a number of steps of order 
2<sup>C</sup>+(V+C)<sup>3</sup>.
This is not a theorem, but merely a heuristic runtime estimate, 
and not a very convincing one; and perhaps the first + sign should be changed to "multiply"
which would make a rather large difference.

<h3> Major defect pointed out by Toby Pereira </h3>
<p>
In this 4-candidate 20-voter 2-winner election
</p><pre>
   10 voters:  A=1 B=1 C=1 D=0
   10 voters:  A=1 B=1 C=0 D=1
</pre><p>
both Ebert's L<sub>2</sub>-norm proposal, and the MILP at top, both would
give p<sub>v</sub>=1/10 to every voter if the winner-set was AB, but
also if the winner set were CD.  I.e. both AB and CD are regarded
by these voting systems as "equally good" winner-duos.
That is foolish since obviously AB is superior.

This same simple election example embarrasses <a href="MonroeMW.html">Monroe's</a>
election method for the same reason.
