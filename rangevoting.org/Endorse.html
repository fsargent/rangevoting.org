Libertarian Party candidate for Colorado Governor Jaime Brown endorsed 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/Approval.tml">approval voting</a> as a plank
in his 2010 campaign platform.  It also was endorsed by
Republican Party candidate for Colorado Secretary of State
Scott Gessler (as a plank in <i>his</I> 2010 campaign &ndash; note the SoS is in charge of 
elections) <i>and he won the seat</i>:
</p><blockquote>
<b>Local choice:</b>
Just as states can develop voting systems that fit their specific needs, local home rule entities should also have substantial leeway in voting systems. To that end, the state legislature should allow home rule municipalities and counties to develop voting methods that meet their needs, including approval voting and range voting.
<br>
&ndash; quoted from Gessler's campaign web page
<a href="http://www.scottgessler.com/issues.htm">http://www.scottgessler.com/issues.htm</a>.
<br><br>
[Gessler] would support local experimentation with what is called 
"approval voting," which allows voters to choose more than one 
candidate in a race. The idea is favored by Libertarians and other 
minor parties who often siphon votes from Republicans and Democrats. 
"That sounds crazy, doesn't it? But it actually works," Gessler said.

We seek endorsements from everyone in all walks of life.  
We also are especially interested in
top scientists, editorialists,
church leaders, party leaders, politicians, social scientists,
professional pollsters, incredibly sexy celebrities, businesspeople, 
army generals, et cetera.
</P>

<p>
You may also  <a href="voldir/Volunteer.html">"join" CRV</a>
(i.e. you might like to work for us in some way) which is different than "endorsing" it.
(Do both!)
</p>

<h2>Endorsement form:</h2>

<p>
Fill in the blanks below.  
The <font color="red"><b>only slots you <i>must</i> fill are your name,
<a href="gbook/FameNumExpl.html" target="blank">fame-number</a>, 
and proof of not being an evil robot.</b></font>  All others are <b>optional.</b>
</p>

<p>
We recommend
also putting a URL (if available) and city/state/country.
Your name will come out hyperlinked to your URL on the 
endorsements page, if you supply a URL.
<i>If</i> you supply an email address, that email address will be available for all to see
on the endorsements page.  If you don't mind people seeing your email address but
are opposed to spambots, then use distorted syntax.
We <i>very</i> highly recommend putting "impressive qualifications" like
"1972 Nobel Prize winner in Physics,"
"Chair of the Democratic Committee of Georgia,"
"Governor of Alabama,"
"Author of *title here* social science books,"
"Episcopalian Bishop," "Professor of xxx at yyy," etc.
Thanks!</p>

<p>
<b>Special note.</b>
If you are not a person but rather an <i>organization</i> like "The Libertarian party,"
or if your endorsement consists of an <i>essay</i> (or to ask questions),
then please notify us of your endorsement by 
email to 
<tt>rangevote AT gmail.com</tt>
instead of using this form.
It would be even better to send it to
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RangeVoting/">RangeVoting at yahoogroups.com</a>,
except that you have to sign up as a "member" of this email-list in order to
post to it, which some may not want to do.
(Essay-style endorsements like Ossipoff's above enable you
to word it exactly the way you want and to say something more individualistic; and it is fine to
provide us with <i>both kinds</i> of endorsement.)
