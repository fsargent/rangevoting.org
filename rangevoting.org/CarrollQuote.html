<H1> Carroll quote </H1>

<p>
Here's what Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) had to say about people's undertsandong of voting:
</p><blockquote>
I am quite prepared to be told, with regard to the cases I have here proposed, 
as I have already been told with regard to others, "Oh, that is an extreme case, it 
would never really happen!" Now I have observed that the answer is always given 
instantly, with perfect confidence, and without examination of the details of the 
proposed case. It must therefore rest on some general principle: the mental process 
being probably something like this &ndash;
'I have formed a theory. This case contradicts my theory. Therefore this is an 
extreme case, and would never occur in practice.'
</blockquote>
