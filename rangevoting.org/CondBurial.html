<H2> "Burial" strategy in Condorcet methods  </H2>

<p><small> By Warren D. Smith, Feb 2008 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<a href="#conc">skip to conclusion</a>)
</small></p>
<p>
We report on some computer Monte-Carlo simulations and theorems
about how often the "burial" strategy works in Condorcet methods.
</p><p>
My simulations were for 4-candidate elections, 
but the theorems hold for any number
N&ge;3 of candidates.
The program supports either the "random election model" or the
"Dirichlet model" (see <a href="Glossary.html">glossary</a>
for definitions of those probability models).
</p><p>
An interesting computer finding, which I then backed up with a
human proof, is the following. "Black's
Condorcet method" is to use Borda if there is no Condorcet winner.
It has generally been looked-down-on by internet Condorcet advocates.
But it turns out to have a nice property.
</p><p>
<b>THEOREM (BLACK BURIAL-RESISTANCE):</b>
In N-candidate elections (N&ge;3 fixed) in the <a href="RandElect.html">random elections model</a>,
using pure-rank-orderings as votes,
consider the "burial" strategy where everybody who voted X=top
C=second, now artificially votes C=bottom (but aside from that,
all votes unchanged). Here C denotes the Black-winner with honest
votes. Then: with <b>probability&rarr;100%</b> in the #voters&rarr;&infin; limit,
the new winner will be neither C nor X.
And when it is not X, that means burial "does not work."
</p><p>
<b>PROOF:</b>
<ol type="I">
<li> 
If C originally was a Condorcet winner:
The new election will with probability 100% have no Condorcet winner
since X will still be beaten pairwise by C, but C will with
probability&rarr;100% be beat by the others thanks to the burial.
(All the "&rarr;100%" statements we make arise easily from standard Gaussian
statistics in the limit of large #voters.  The point is that the amount
of typical statistical variation away from "all vote-counts equal"
is of order &radic;V, and variations larger than that are arbitrarily unlikely;
meanwhile the strategy
pushes stuff by a far larger amount of order V, in the limit V&rarr;&infin;.)
So Black goes to Borda. But the burial raises the Borda scores of
all rivals Y,Z,... of C and X, while leaving X's Borda-score unaltered
and lowering C's. Hence with probability&rarr;100% one of those rivals
will win. 
</li><li>
If there originally was no Condorcet winner (so C was the Borda winner):
The new election will with probability&rarr;100% have Borda winner&isin;{Y,Z,...}.
This will be the Black-winner too because the only way to avoid that is
if the burial creates a Condorcet winner.  The burial causes the Y:C and Z:C comparisions
to improve for Y,Z and worsen for C, but does not affect any other pairwise
comparisons.  Hence it cannot create a Condorcet winner except if that winner is among
{Y,Z,...}.
</li></ol>
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
In the <i>Dirichlet model</i>, however, <i>burial still works</i> with
Black voting. My simulation finds, in fact, that it works
(29.50&plusmn;0.03)%                                                  
of the time for X (where X is the candidate who would have
won if C were disallowed) with 4 candidates; as opposed to tending to 0% in
the Random Elections Model.
</p><p>
Note that the BURIAL-RESISTANCE THEOREM is <i>not</i>
going to have a nice analogue for most other commonly proposed
Condorcet variants. It is pretty special to Black's method.
</p><p>
In particular(!), we have the exact <i>opposite</i> property for
Nanson-Baldwin's Condorcet method (which consists in repeatedly
eliminating the Borda-loser):
</p><p>
<b>THEOREM (BURIAL-VULNERABILITY FOR NANSON-BALDWIN):</b>
In the same scenario but now using "Nanson-Baldwin's Condorcet
method," burying C works for the X=top C=second voters (where X is the
candidate who would have won with honest votes if C had not been in
the race) with <b>probability&rarr;100%</b> to make X become the winner.
</p><p>
<b>PROOF:</b>
Because C will with probability&rarr;100% have the lowest Borda score hence
be eliminated first in the modified election.
Then all the rankings among X, Y, Z,... (<i>after</i> C's elimination)
are unaltered by the strategy
and hence X still will beat the others with certainty.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
But (again) if we switch to the alternative <i>Dirichlet</i> model, 
then burial no longer reliably works, albeit the computer finds it works at least about 17.1% of
the time in 4-candidate situations (this figure is only a lower bound).
<!--
Monte-Carlo indicates that burying the winner works to make him become the Borda loser
(17.057&plusmn;0.06)% of the time in 4-candidate elections
-->
</p><p>
Most common Condorcet-methods proposals are somewhere in between the two extremes
represented by Black and Nanson-Baldwin.
For example, 
N.Tideman in his book and D.Woodall both have recommended (two different) variants
of a Condorcet method one might call "Smith-IRV."  It involves eliminating both candidates
not in the "Smith set" as well as eliminating those top-ranked the least.
(<a href="SmithIRV.html">Woodall's version</a> makes more sense to me, but
those details will not matter for our purposes here.)
In this method, burial works, in the 4-candidate random elections model,
with some probability which tends to a nonzero limit as #voters&rarr;&infin;.
(Proof sketch: In pretty much any situation where C was the Condorcet winner but
would be eliminated early in IRV voting, we have vulnerability to C-burial.) 
</p><p>
As another example, the "Simpson-Kramer min-max" Condorcet method consists in
electing the candidate whose strongest-pairwise-defeat, is the weakest.
My Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that burying C works for the X-top voters (where X is the
second-place candidate, i.e. who has the second-weakest strongest-pairwise-defeat)
with 
probability (27.40&plusmn;0.11)% in the Dirichlet and
(42.89&plusmn;0.07)%
in the random-election model
with 4 candidates.
</p><p>
The "Copeland" method is to elect the candidate who defeats the most rivals pairwise. 
(We shall break ties by using a random fixed candidate-ordering.)	
My Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that burying C works for the X-top voters (where X is the
second-place candidate)
with 
probability (32.28&plusmn;0.1)% in the Dirichlet and
(82.18&plusmn;0.1)%
in the random-election model
with 4 candidates.
</p><p>
If we instead break Copeland ties using <i>Borda</i>,
then 
Monte Carlo shows 
the Dirichlet burial-works probability shrinks to (29.9&plusmn;0.1)%,
and (we prove in <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p86">puzzle 86</a>)
the 
random-election model
probability shrinks to &rarr;0 in the 4-candidate case, but
stays 
a positive constant if there are at least 5 candidates.

<h2> Chris Benham points out things may not be so cut-and-dried </h2>

<p>
<i>Despite</i> the fact Black is asymptotically 
100% burial-resistant in the random-elections model,
while some other Condorcet methods like Smith-IRV and Schulze are not
(and Nanson-Baldwin is asymptotically 100% burial-vulnerable),
Chris J.  Benham points out
that in the following election (the "B>C>A" votes are insincere and arise from
a strategic decision to "bury" A; they honestly would be "B>A>C")...
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #Voters </th>
<th> Their Vote </th>
</tr>
<tr><td> 46 </td><td> A>B>C </td></tr>
<tr><td> 44 </td><td> B>C>A (*) </td></tr>
<tr><td>  5 </td><td> C>A>B </td></tr>
<tr><td>  5 </td><td> C>B>A </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
... Black 
awards the victory to <b>B</b>, the one who orchestrated the burying.
(A>B>C>A cycle; Borda scores: A=97,  B=139,  C=64.
(Also saying <b>B</b> wins:
Tideman ranked-pairs, Schulze-beatpaths, Simpson-Kramer min-max,
and basic Condorcet.)
Meanwhile Nanson-Baldwin and Smith-IRV both elect the honest-votes winner, <b>A</b>!
</p>

<p>
The main reason for this discrepancy is that the "random elections model" is
not a terribly realistic probability model for elections &ndash;
at least not for the elections Benham 
mainly cares about involving only two strong candidates.
(The Dirichlet model comes closer.)
On the other hand in a hypothetical future world in which elections are run using
Condorcet voting, perhaps the random elections model would become a better statistical
model than it is now.
</p>
<p>
Benham favors Woodall's Smith-IRV Condorcet method above the others.  As an example
of its superiority, Benham gives
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr> 
<th> #Voters </th>

<tr><td> 49 </td><td> C>B>A (*) </td></tr>

<tr><td> 17 </td><td> B>A>C </td></tr>
<tr><td>  3 </td><td> A>B>C </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
where the (*) votes insincerely bury A.  Almost every Condorcet method known to man
elects <b>C</b> due to the burial-strategy employed by C-voters.   That includes Black's method
(since the Borda scores are A=85, B=86, C=129 and we have an A>C>B>A cycle).
But not Woodall's Smith-IRV method, which
successfully elects <b>A</b> (the honest-vote Condorcet winner).
<p>
<a name="conc"></a>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p>
<p>
Our results greatly-contradict the usual previous thinking that the differences between
Condorcet methods in  vulnerability to strategy, are small.
That's interesting and new.  However, as Benham points out, just because that result holds 
in the 
"random elections model" does not necessarily mean it should be taken too seriously in
real life.
</p><p>
So maybe the internet Condorcet community should now re-evaluate which
Condorcet variants they prefer. (As well as re-evaluate how well they claim to
have "understood" Condorcet strategy. It appears they were
overconfident in their assertions of understanding.)  Or maybe not.
</p><p>
In the random elections model,
some Condorcet variants are highly
burial-resistant (Black); others are
highly vulnerable (Nanson-Baldwin);
and most are in between (Simpson-Kramer min-max, 
Smith-IRV, and I presume also
Tideman ranked pairs, Schulze,
etc.; I <a href="CondStratProb.html#estim">estimate</a>
crudely that these too have burial-works probabilities 
on the order of 50% in the 4-candidate random elections model).
</p><p>
These results are also relevant to the following important debate.
I had <b>contended</b> that real voters, if made to use Condorcet voting, would usually
artificially rank the two major-party candidates top and bottom.
They would do this for psychological/strategic reasons to maximize the impact of their vote
(reasons include: the effectiveness of "burial";
the usefulness of "<a href="IncentToExagg.html">favorite betrayal</a>" in 
<a href="VenzkePf.html">every</a> Condorcet method; also the theorem that
the "rank the major threat bottom and the most-likely-to-win better rival top"
strategy is usually near-maximally
effective in a <a href="ConitzerSmanipEasy.pdf">very wide class</a> of
single-winner election methods).  If enough of that behavior
occurred, a third-party candidate could never win.
Thus, Condorcet voting might lead to 
<b>self-reinforcing 2-party domination</b> in which every voter
robotically followed the recommendations of the "how to vote" cards from
the two major-parties, since history kept proving
no other course was worth bothering with.
</p><p>
But given that voters only ever had 2 real choices, the "improvement" 
caused by having Condorcet voting versus plain Plurality, wouldn't
be much of an improvement, since every voting method is essentially
the same as plain plurality in the 2-candidate case.
</p><p>
So if and when this contention is correct, Condorcet voting is practically 
<b>dead on arrival.</b>
But <i>is</i> it correct?  Nobody really knows, but here are arguments pro and con:
<table bgcolor="black" cellpadding="3" celspacing="2">
<tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"><th>Pro:</th><th>Con:</th></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#88ff88">
Yes, based on <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">data</a> that 
a huge percentage of Australian voters behave this way even though burial
actually makes less strategic sense in Australia's IRV system than with
Condorcet methods, even Black's.
(That is: with IRV, the "X>C>others" voters can <i>never</i> make X win by voting "X>others>C."
With Condorcet, they sometimes can; indeed even with Black's Condorcet method, they sometimes
can &ndash;
the probability&rarr;0% result only happens in a limit which is never actually achieved in
a probabilistic model which does not correspond perfectly to reality.)
</td><td bgcolor="#ff8888">
<i>No</i>, the contention is severely undercut <i>provided</i> we use
<i>Black's</i> method, by the fact that 
Burial is highly strategically ineffective with Black
under the Random Elections Model.  (Of course, you'd need to believe Joe Voter would
appreciate this theorem and method-flavor-distinction.  Which seems doubtful in view of 
the Australian facts at left.)
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#88ff88">
Yes, <i>rationally</i>, based on theoretical analysis indicating Burial works
in a lot of Condorcet situations for a lot of Condorcet methods
(about 20-80% of the time depending on the probability model and
the Condorcet variant); if this percentage greatly
exceeds the percentage of the time third-parties win, then the 
exaggeration strategy is worth it  overall.
</td><td bgcolor="#ff8888">
Despite the huge percent of Australians who just follow the major party
"how to vote" recommendations, these majors-top-and-bottom
votes can still lead to third-party Condorcet winners
if the two majors are precisely-balanced-enough and there is a small percentage of
votes that rank the third-party candidate top.  That just might happen 
<a href="Aus07.html">often enough</a> that
two-party domination will <i>not</i> ensue with Condorcet.  (Certainly, Condorcet is more likely
to avoid duopoly, than IRV; but unfortunately
IRV experimentally <a href="AustralianPol.html#indep">does</a> 
lead to self-reinforcing 2-party domination.)
