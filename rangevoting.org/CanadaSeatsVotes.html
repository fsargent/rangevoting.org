<H1> Canada: seat and vote counts by party. Data. </H1>
<p><small>
Warren D. Smith, Oct 2015
</small></p>

<p>
For each federal election in Canada, 1980-2015 (which is 11 elections in all), 
we tabulate the number (and percentage)
of seats won by each party, the popular-vote-percentage obtained by that party,
and the number of "top up seats" that would be required to bring that party's seat count
up to proportionality (to within &plusmn;1 seat) if among the W seats in parliament
T were top-up seats while W-T were elected directly using the same seat-percentages as 
officially happened.  
For each election we compute the <i>minimal</i> total number T of top up seats needed
to reach proportionality (the resulting T values differ from election to election).
We also state the total number C of candidates and V of voters.
(0&le;T&lt;W&le;C&lt;V.)
And the gap (difference in vote percentages) between the top and 2nd top party.
</p><p>
Observe that in 8 out of 11 cases, the governing party was given <i>zero</i> top-up seats.
That is because, usually, 
single-winner voting systems (especially <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>)
tend to yield <i>over</i>representation
(and also the <i>most</i> overrepresentation)
by the top party in parliament.  In such cases a minimal top-up would only give seats to the
<i>non</i>governing parties.  However, that over-representation is only a trend, not
a guarantee; sometimes (e.g. 2008) the top party would deserve top-up seats.
</p><p>
Also note that in 9 out of 11 cases, making 33% (or fewer) seats be top-ups would have been enough
to obtain proportionality.  And one might conjecture that if 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score voting</a> &ndash; a better single-winner system &ndash;
had been used instead of
<a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> voting, then this 33% could safely be decreased 
(to, perhaps, 25%?).
If Canada had had a fixed 33% top-up 67% local-MP composition for parliament,
then the average fraction of parliament consisting of MPs elected from
the top party and via top-up (simultaneously) would have been about 2%.

Although 1984 and 1988 featured the highest turnouts at 75.3% among the elections

I am not sure whether the 22.55% vote-percentage gap in 1993 was the greatest ever.
It might be.

There also were at least three ridings
in the 1993 general election 
(Vancouver Quadra won by E.W. "Ted" McWhinney;
Vancouver East won by Anna Terrana;
Vancouver South won by Herb Dhaliwal)
featuring at least <b>13</b> candidates,
which might be the all-time record and probably is the record among the elections
1980-2015.  
(Also at least one riding in 1988 featured 12 candidates.)
In any case it seems that ridings have &ge;13 candidates only about 1 time in 1000.
</p>



<h3> Closer look at the 2015 and 2011 (and other) elections </h3>

<p>
<b>Parties vs Independents:</b>
In 1997, 95% of candidates ran under the flag of a party, only 5% were unaffiliated.
</p>

<p>
(Much of the year-2015 notes below stolen from a CBC News piece.)
</P>
<p><b>2015:</b>
Turnout=69%.
(The highest-turnout single riding was Ottawa Centre with 85%.)
</p><p>
24 parties ran candidates (plus there were unaffiliated candidates)
but only 4 parties won seats &ndash; Liberals, Conservative, NDP, and Bloc Quebecois &ndash;
and no unaffiliated MPs won.
</p><p>
The ridings with the greatest number of candidates apparently were
Edmonton Mill Woods with 8
(Jasvir Deol,
Peter Downing,
Ralph McLean,
Allen KW Paley,
Naomi Rankin,
Amarjeet Sohi,
Colin Stubbs,
Tim Uppal)
and Hochelaga with 8
(Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet,
Marianne Fontaine,
Christine Dandenault,
Alexandre Dang,
Nicolas Lemay,
Simon Marchand,
Marwah Rizqy,
Anne-Marie Saint-Cerny).
Warning: my software hack may have been confused by data formatting issues in the 
<a href="assets/documents/Canada2015detailedResults.txt">2015 results file</a>, so these "8"s are only
lower bounds. 
</p><p>
In 22 ridings, the margin of victory was 1.5% or less. 
The narrowest margin was in Winnipeg's Elmwood-Transcona, where, as of Oct. 21,
the NDP's Daniel Blaikie won by 51 votes, 0.1%,
over his Conservative opponent, Lawrence Toet, the MP since 2011.
</p><p>
Liberal Judy Foote won the highest share of the vote, 81.8%, 
in Bonavista-Burin-Trinity. 
(She'd represented the Newfoundland south shore riding since 2008.)
</p><p>
The winning candidate with the smallest share of the vote 
&ndash; just 28.5% &ndash;
was newcomer Brigitte Sansoucy, running for the NDP in Quebec's Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot riding.
</p><p>
Niagara Falls riding had more people on the voters list than any other with 102602, 
with Edmonton-Wetaskiwin next at 98502.
Canada's largest electoral district by area, Nunavut, had the smallest number of voters 
listed, 19223. (The median size for a riding is about 78600 voters.)
</p><p>
Thirty candidates received 40% or more of the votes but still lost. In St. John's East, 
incumbent NDP MP Jack Harris got 45.3% of the popular vote, but Liberal Nick Whalen won.
</p><p>
Two candidates with more than 30 per cent of the popular vote finished in third place: 
Liberal Steve Powrie in B.C.'s Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo, with 30.5 per cent, and in 
Desnethe-Missinippi-Churchill River, Saskatchewan's most northerly riding, 
Conservative Rob Clarke finished third with 30.2 per cent of the votes. 
He had represented the area  &ndash; a new constituency &ndash; since 2008.
</p><p>
Brian Goldman asked:
How many seats were won without a majority? The answer is: 'most of them':
<ul><li>
Liberal 97 of 184 = 53%
</li><li>
Conservative 57 of 99 = 58%
</li><li>
NDP-New Democratic Party 42 of 44 = 95%
</li><li>
Bloc Quebecois 10 of 10 = 100%
</li><li>
Green Party 0 of 1 = 0%
</li></ul>
In total 206 of 338=61% of seats were won without a majority and therefore (perhaps)
would not have had the same winner under alternative voting systems.
(<a href="http://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e">source</a>.)
</p>


<p><b>2011:</b>
Turnout=61%.
</p><p>
How many seats were won without a majority? The answer is: 'most of them':
<ul><li>
Conservative 59 of 166 = 36%
</li><li>
NDP-New Democratic Party 67 of 103 = 65%
</li><li>
Liberal 32 of 34 = 94%
</li><li>
Bloc Quebecois 4 of 4 = 100%
</li><li>
Green Party 1 of 1 = 100%
</li></ul>
In total 163 of 308=53% of seats were won without a majority and therefore (perhaps)
would not have had the same winner under alternative voting systems.
(<a href="http://www.elections.ca/scripts/resval/ovr_41ge.asp?prov=&lang=e">source</a>.)
</p>

<p><b>Women:</b>
In 2015: 88 women MPs were elected out of 338 total (26%, highest ever); 
about 33% of the candidates were women.
In 2011: 77 women MPs were elected out of 308 total (25%); 
about 33% of the candidates were women.  
1988 
was the first time women were above 10%, and
1997 was the first time women were above 20%, of
parliament; and in both cases they have exceeded those levels ever since.
24.4% of the candidates were women in 1997.
