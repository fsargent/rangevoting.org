<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>In 1770, Jean-Charles de Borda raised objection to the opinion, then
generally held, that &quot;in an election by ballot the plurality of voices
indicates the will of the electors.&quot; He argued that this opinion,
&quot;true in the case where the election is conducted between two candidates
only, may lead to error in all other cases.&quot; He provided an example
in which several candidates espousing similar positions might split the
votes of the majority, permitting an opposing minority candidate to receive
a plurality of votes and win the election. History has borne out Borda's
concern. For example, in the 1912 U.S. presidential election, Roosevelt
and Taft (former and incumbent Republican presidents) split a majority
of the popular vote, allowing Wilson to win.</P>

<P>To address this problem, Borda proposed &quot;election by order of merit,&quot;
now known as Borda's rule. Under this method, each voter ranks the candidates
in order, and each candidate is awarded a number of votes (from that voter)
equal to the number of other candidates ranked below him; the candidate
receiving the greatest total number of votes wins the election. However,
Borda presented no argument that his proposal was the only method which
would &quot;solve&quot; the perceived problem.</P>

<P>In the state of New York in 1970, a seat in the U.S. Senate was at stake.
The Democratic and Liberal-Republican nominees split the liberal vote,
and the Conservative candidate was elected with only 39 percent of the
vote. The following year, in a mayoral election in Ithaca, New York, the
Democratic nominee drew 29.1 percent of the vote and edged out the Republican
nominee, who drew 28.9 percent; an independent Democratic candidate received
10.2 percent, and two independent Republican candidates received a combined
total of 31.8 percent. This author, then a graduate student at Cornell
(and a supporter of losing candidates in both elections), was prompted
by these two results to propose an alternative to the plurality rule called
&quot;approval voting.&quot;</P>

<P>The idea is a simple one: Each voter is allowed to cast a single vote
for each of as many candidates as he or she wishes -- that is, the voter
votes for all candidates of whom the voter &quot;approves.&quot; The candidate
receiving the greatest total number of votes is declared the winner.</P>

<P>A particular attraction of this method was that most voting machines
require no special modification for approval voting to be implemented.
In most jurisdictions, there are elections where voters choose several
candidates from a longer list: perhaps multiple judgeships in a single
district, or seats on public commissions. In such elections, the machines
can be set to impose an upper bound on the number of single votes a voter
can cast; for example, if there were only three seats on a commission,
the voter could cast single votes for at most three candidates. By setting
the upper bound equal to the total number of candidates in the race, approval
votes could easily be cast and tallied.</P>

<P>From the start, approval voting appeared to be an idea whose time had
come. Fishburn and Gehrlein had independently analyzed the results of the
1968 U.S. Presidential race, in which George Wallace ran as a third-party
candidate, using much the same idea. In the mid-1970s, Brams studied properties
of a voting system under which voters could cast either a single positive,
or a single negative, vote: In the three-candidate case, this system is
equivalent to approval voting (since casting approval votes for two candidates
has the same effect on relative vote totals as casting a negative vote
for the third).</P>

<P>Brams became an apostle of approval voting. Through a book (Brams and
Fishburn, 1983) and a number of public presentations, he built support
for the idea. Today, professional organizations such as the Institute of
Management Sciences, the IEEE, the Mathematical Association of America,
and the American Statistical Association, with total membership in excess
of 400,000, use approval voting to elect their officers.</P>

<P>In the former Soviet Union, many elections involved the presentation
of a list of candidates to the voters, and voters were allowed only to
cross names off the list: this system is equivalent to allowing the casting
of approval votes (for the candidates not crossed off). A bill permitting
the use of approval voting in public elections has been passed by the North
Dakota Senate, and in 1991 Oregon conducted a public referendum involving
five alternatives using approval voting. Clearly, approval voting is a
viable and practical alternative to the plurality rule.</P>

<H4>How Voters Vote</H4>

<P>The political arena is complex. Parties form, merge, split, and dissolve.
Individual candidates stake out positions, sometimes as a matter of principle,
and sometimes to increase their chances of being elected. Voters at some
times have little information, and at other times are inundated with poll
results and political advertising. The voting system in use can affect
all of these dimensions of complexity. The following sections will discuss
some of the effects of approval voting, and offer comparisons with plurality
rule and Borda's rule. This section will set a general stage for a broader
discussion of the ultimate choice problem facing individual voters.</P>

<P>Assume that there are k candidates, numbered 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;k.
A scoring rule for an election is a collection of vote-sets, where each
vote-set consists of k numbers. A voter selects a vote-set, and assigns
the numbers within that set to the candidates. The candidate assigned the
greatest total across all voters wins the election. Plurality rule offers
to each voter a single vote-set, {1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0}. Borda's
rule also offers a single vote-set, {k-1,&nbsp;k-2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0}.
Approval voting offers a collection of vote-sets, {1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0},
{1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0}, ..., {1,&nbsp;1, ..., 1,&nbsp;0}.</P>

<P>Each voter can be assumed to hold two relevant pieces of information.
First, the voter have personal preferences over the possible outcomes of
the election<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 1">1</A></SUP>: We will assume that
voters are expected utility maximizers. In addition, the voters will hold
subjective beliefs about the relative likelihood that any particular choice
of voting action will change the result of the election in some way. We
represent these beliefs by assuming that each voter holds in his mind a
set of &quot;close-race&quot; probabilities; p<SUB>ij</SUB> will indicate
the probability, given that the election is a near-tie between <I>some</I>
two candidates, that the near-tie will be between candidates i and j.<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 2">2</A></SUP>
In this case, a voter's decision problem is to maximize his expected utility
payoff, based on the utility that voter would receive from various candidates
being elected, the probability that a close race will occur, and the chance
that a change in voting will tip the race. </P>

<P>Where do the perceptions of the close-race probabilities come from?
We will consider two cases in the following sections. In one case, each
voter will be assumed to have no specific knowledge concerning the intended
voting behavior of the others. We represent this by taking all of the close-race
probabilities to be equal.<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 3">3</A></SUP> Voters
who select their vote vectors in accordance with the resulting objective
function are said to be voting &quot;sincerely,&quot; since they choose
based on their own preferences, without direct strategic consideration
of the voting intentions of others. Under the plurality rule, sincere voters
vote for their most-preferred candidate. Under Borda's rule, sincere voters
assign the highest number of votes to their most-preferred candidate, second-highest
to the second-most-preferred, and so on. Under approval voting, sincere
voters cast their approval votes for all candidates who are &quot;above
average&quot; in the field.</P>

<P>However, most modern elections of public officials take place in settings
where pre-election polls are conducted, and the results are published.
In such a case, the perceived close-race probabilities can differ across
the various candidate pairs. As a result, voters may not select their most-preferred
if that candidate is perceived to have little chance of being in a close
race for victory.</P>

<P>Indeed, under plurality rule, any candidate other than the voter's least-preferred
could potentially draw the vote, depending on which close contests are
considered most likely.<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 4">4</A> </SUP>Under Borda's
rule, even the least-preferred candidate might draw a positive number of
votes. Consider a three-candidate race, and a voter who would derive utilities
(u<SUB>1</SUB>,&nbsp;u<SUB>2</SUB>,&nbsp;u<SUB>3</SUB>)&nbsp;= (10,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;0)
from the election of each of the three candidates respectively. If the
close-race probabilities are perceived to be (p<SUB>12</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>13</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>23</SUB>)&nbsp;=
(0.7,&nbsp;0.2,&nbsp;0.1), then the high likelihood of a close race involving
the first two candidates will lead the voter to cast two votes for the
first and none for the second, &quot;discarding&quot; his middle vote on
the third (i.e., the prospective ranking of candidate&nbsp;3&nbsp;(-2.5)
exceeds that of candidate&nbsp;2&nbsp;(-3.0), and the voter will cast
the vote vector (2,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1)).</P>

<P>Under approval voting, a voter will cast approval votes for all candidates
with positive prospective rankings, and will not vote for any candidate
with a negative ranking. It is an easy exercise to show that, in any race,
a voter will have a positive prospective ranking for his most-preferred
candidate, and a negative ranking for his least-preferred. So, in a three-candidate
race, the voter will either vote for his most-preferred candidate alone,
or for the two candidates who are both preferred to the third.</P>

<P>In races involving more than three candidates, it is possible to construct
close-race probabilities which will lead to non-monotonicity in a voter's
casting of approval votes. For example, if a voter assigns any utilities
u<SUB>1&nbsp;</SUB>&gt;&nbsp;u<SUB>2&nbsp;</SUB>&gt;&nbsp;u<SUB>3&nbsp;</SUB>&gt;&nbsp;u<SUB>4</SUB>
to the election of each of four candidates respectively, and perceives
the close-race probabilities to be (p<SUB>12</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>13</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>14</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>23</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>24</SUB>,&nbsp;p<SUB>34</SUB>)&nbsp;=
(0.5,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0.5), then he will prefer to
vote for candidates 1 and 3, but not for candidates 2 and 4. Note, however,
that the close-race perceptions indicate that 2 is relatively more likely
to be in a close race with 1 than with 4, while 3 is relatively more likely
to be in a close race with 4 than with 1.</P>

<P>If we make the not-unreasonable assumption that for all candidates i,
j, k, and l, p<SUB>ik</SUB>/p<SUB>jk&nbsp;</SUB>=&nbsp;p<SUB>il</SUB>/p<SUB>jl</SUB>
(i.e., that the relative chances of i or j being in contention with any
other candidate are the same for all other candidates), then a voter will
only cast an approval vote for a particular candidate if he also casts
approval votes for all candidates preferred to that one.<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 5">5</A></SUP>
Under this assumption, approval voting poses to voters a particularly simple 
strategic choice problem: All a voter must decide is where to draw the line 
between preferred candidates (who receive approval votes) and not-so-preferred 
candidates (who don't).</P>

<H4>Sincere Comparisons</H4>

<P>One use of voting systems is to select from among a number of alternatives,
in settings where the voters have little access to information concerning
either the preferences of the other voters or the intended voting behavior
of the others. In these settings a voter can be presumed to vote sincerely,
since the lack of information about other voters means there is no basis
for voting in some clever strategic way. A typical example of such a setting
would be the election of an officer for a professional society. A nominating
committee selects a group of candidates, all of whom are considered eminently
qualified for the post. The list of nominees is presented to the society's
membership, and individuals form their preferences based on a wide variety
of personal factors.</P>

<P>In this setting, the goal of the election is to select a candidate who
well-represents the preferences of the voters. To choose among alternative
voting systems, it is necessary to specify how the &quot;representativeness&quot;
of the selected candidate will be measured. Take a specific voter. Prior
to presentation of the list of nominees, the voter will not know what the
structure of his preferences will be like; for example, he will not know
whether he will like some of the nominees, and dislike others, or will
like them all, but slightly prefer some over the others. The voter would
most prefer (and would be best served by) the use of a voting system which
maximizes the expected utility to himself of the eventually-elected candidate.</P>

<P>Consider an election involving only two candidates, in which just over
half of the voters slightly prefer the first of the two candidates, while
the rest strongly prefer the second.<SUP><A HREF="#Endnote 6">6</A></SUP>
In this situation, a nominal voter, not knowing in advance of the election 
whether he will be one of the voters with slight or strong preferences, 
would like to see in place a voting system which would lead to the election 
of the second candidate (the one strongly preferred by the minority).</P>

<P>It is possible to construct voting systems with this property. For example,
each voter could be given a limited number of votes to use in a series
of elections. Or voting could be made costly. Under either of these systems,
voters with only slight preferences in a particular election might choose
to abstain. In effect, both systems force the voters to make budget-allocation
decisions across multiple elections.</P>

<P>However, if we wish to use a voting system for a single election, under
which the actions of the voters have no carry-over effect, then we must
accept the fact that the candidate slightly preferred by the majority will
win (when each voter, at the time of the election, votes in his own best
interest).</P>

<P>We will restrict our further attention to single elections. Assume that
the utilities of the nominated candidates to each voter are independent,
identically-distributed draws from a fixed probability distribution. Before
the presentation of the list of nominees, a voter would most prefer the
use of a voting system which captures his eventual intensity of preference
by selecting the candidate with maximal mean utility across the electorate
(since the voter does not know, before the nominees are announced, which
position he will hold in the electorate). </P>

<P>Although the earlier discussion shows that no such voting system can
be constructed, it can still be useful to consider such a voting system
as a benchmark for comparison. In this spirit, let B represent the expected
utility of the selected candidate to a voter, did such a voting system
exist. Let A be the expected utility to a voter of the elected candidate
under some particular voting system, when all voters vote sincerely. And
let C be the expected utility of a randomly-selected candidate to a voter.
Then a measure of the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of the voting system in
representing the preferences of the voters is (A-C)/(B-C). The difference
between A and C represents the gain from using the voting system over choosing
a candidate randomly. The difference between B and C represents the maximum
possible gain from any voting system over random selection. Thus, the ratio
offers a measure of what share of the ideal gain is captured by a particular
voting system.</P>

<P>Weber (1977) explored this measure of effectiveness in some detail.
Here, we cite several results for the case in which the underlying distribution
of the utilities of the candidates to the voters is uniform, and the electorate
is large.</P>

<P>For two-candidate elections, all voting systems are essentially equivalent,
and have an effectiveness of <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/radical.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=22>6/3&nbsp;=&nbsp;81.65
percent. For three-candidate elections, the plurality rule has an effectiveness
of 75 percent, Borda's rule has an effectiveness of <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/radical.gif"" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=22>3/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;86.6
percent, and approval voting has an effectiveness of 87.5 percent: Approval
voting is the most effective of these three commonly-discussed voting systems
in the three-candidate case.</P>

<P>Of course, there's more to this story. Other voting systems are even
more effective in the three-candidate case. The best known result is for
the voting system which allows voters to cast 4 votes for one candidate,
either 3 or 1 votes for another, and 0 votes for the third; this system
has an effectiveness of <IMG SRC="radical.gif"" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=22>13/4&nbsp;=&nbsp;90.14
percent. In the k-candidate case, the effectiveness of the plurality
rule is <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/radical.gif"" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=22>(3k)/(k+1), and the effectiveness
of Borda's rule is <IMG SRC="radical.gif"" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=22>(k/(k+1)). In other
words, as the number of candidates becomes large, the plurality rule is
little better than random selection of a winner, while Borda's rule approaches
100 percent effectiveness. However, the effectiveness of approval voting
is not known for k&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3.</P>

<H4>Strategic Comparisons</H4>

<P>In many political settings, voters have access to substantial information,
typically gleaned from public opinion polls, concerning the expressed preferences
and voting intentions of others. This information can affect each voter's
perception of the relative chances of the various candidates being in contention
for victory, which in turn can affect the how voters cast their ballots.
</P>

<P>Just as prices both summarize consumer demand and generate that same
demand in a competitive equilibrium, so one might expect that, after a
series of polls are reported, voters might eventually hold perceptions
of the candidate's relative chances of contending for victory which both
summarize the electorate's voting intentions, and generate vote totals
which justify the voters' perceptions. From this perspective, Myerson and
Weber&nbsp;(1993) developed the notion of a &quot;voting equilibrium.&quot;
A voting equilibrium arises in an &quot;electoral situation&quot; consisting
of a set of candidates, a distribution of voters (indicating the proportions
of the electorate holding different types of preferences), and a voting
rule. The equilibrium itself consists of a set of relative probabilities
of the election ending in a close race between any pair of candidates,
and a specification of voting behavior for the various types of voters.
At equilibrium, each voter is specified to vote in a manner which maximizes
that voter's expected utility from the outcome of the election (given the
perceived close-race probabilities), and the close-race probabilities are
consistent with the candidate vote totals resulting from the specified
behavior.</P>

<P>After proving that voting equilibria exist in every electoral situation,
Myerson and Weber&nbsp;(1993) determine the equilibria under the plurality
rule, Borda's rule, and approval voting for a particular situation meant
to represent the type of historical situations discussed early in this
paper. Specifically, the situation has three candidates (1, 2, and&nbsp;3),
and three types of voters (A, B, and&nbsp;C). The utilities (u<SUB>1</SUB>,&nbsp;u<SUB>2</SUB>,&nbsp;u<SUB>3</SUB>)
derived by a voter of any type from the election of any of the candidates
is given in Table 1. Notice that voters A and B together make up a majority
of the electorate, and prefer either 1 or 2. However, they could quite
possible split the vote, and hand the election to 3.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Under plurality rule, three voting equilibria exist. At one, all of
the type-A and type-B voters cast their votes for candidate 1, and all
of the type-C voters vote for candidate 3. The likelihood of candidates
1 and 3 being in a close race for victory is perceived by the voters to
be much greater than the chance of any other pair of candidates being in
a close race, and, since candidates 1 and 3 are the two highest vote-getters,
the voters' perceptions are justified by the outcome. A similar equilibrium
exists, wherein the type-A and type-B voters all vote for candidate&nbsp;2.</P>

<P>However, there is a third voting equilibrium, at which all voters of
each type vote for their most-favored candidate, and candidate 3 wins the
election. The voters correctly perceive that close races between candidates
1 and 3, and between candidates 2 and 3, are of comparable likelihood and
are much more likely than a close race between candidates 1 and 2 (the
two lowest vote-getters), and these perceptions justify the voters' actions.
This equilibrium appears to correspond to the outcome of the historical
elections cited earlier.</P>

<P>Under Borda's rule, a family of voting equilibria exist. At all of these
equilibria, all three candidates are expected to draw roughly equal vote
totals, but a close race between candidates 1 and 2 is perceived by the
voters to be somewhat more likely than between candidate 3 and either 1
or 2 (indeed, the first close race is perceived to be precisely 28 times
as likely as each of the other two). At equilibrium, each voter casts his
2-vote for his most-favored candidate. However, some type-A or type-B voters
give the 1-vote to their second-most-favored candidate, while others give
the 1-vote to candidate 3. (The close-race perceptions justify this behavior
by making the type-A and type-B voters indifferent between casting the
1-vote for either of the two less-favored candidates.)</P>

<P>Under approval voting, three voting equilibria exist. Two of the equilibria
are similar in outcome to the first two under the plurality rule. One of
candidates 1 or 2 draws approval votes from all of the type-A and type-B
voters, the other draws approval votes only from the voters who most prefer
him, and the type-C voters vote only for candidate 3. Since candidate 3
finishes with the second-highest vote total, the only justified perceptions
are that a close race involving him and the likely winner are much more
likely than any other close race. Yet, if some other close race were to
develop, it is perceived to be much more likely to involve candidates 1
and 2 (the first- and third-place finishers) than candidate 3 and the third-place
finisher. These perceptions in turn justify the voters' actions.</P>

<P>The third voting equilibrium resembles that found under Borda's rule.
One-third of the type-A and type-B voters vote for both candidates
1 and 2, while everyone else votes only for his most-favored candidate.
All three candidates are expected to draw roughly equal vote totals, but
a close race between 1 and 2 is perceived to be 9&nbsp;times as likely
as the close races between one of them and candidate 3. (These perceptions
make type-A and type-B voters indifferent between single- and double-voting.)
</P>

<P>What can be made of all this? Only under approval voting do all of the
equilibria involve every voter casting a ballot on which the votes for
each candidate decrease monotonically with the utility derived by the voter
from each candidate's election.</P>

<P>Approval voting is the only voting system among the three studied under
which there <I>are</I> equilibria at which one of the first two candidates
is the only likely winner, and at the same time there <I>aren't</I> any
equilibria in which candidate 3 is the only likely winner. Borda's rule
fails to have the first of these properties, and the plurality rule fails
to have the second.</P>

<P>Under both plurality rule and approval voting, there remains room for
the candidates to engage in political activities which seek to influence
voter perceptions of their &quot;viability,&quot; in order to lead to a
particular equilibrium outcome. Much computational work remains to be done
to provide a more-complete picture of how the sets of voting equilibria
under these voting rules, and others, vary with the demographics of the
electorate.</P>

<H4>Candidate Positioning</H4>

<P>One oft-cited claim is that the plurality rule induces candidates to
take moderate positions. A typical justification for this claim comes from
a variety of &quot;median-voter&quot; theorems. For example, in two-candidate
races where the voters are distributed along a single dimension (in terms
of the most-preferred position of each voter on a single issue), then the
more-extreme candidate can increase his vote total by moving his stand
closer to the median position; at equilibrium, both candidates will take
this median position.</P>

<P>However, when three or more candidates are in the running, things change
considerably. If two candidates, positioned at opposite ends of the political
spectrum, are perceived to be the only candidates likely to be in contention
for victory, then under the plurality rule voters will ignore more moderate
candidates (that is, they will choose not to waste their votes), and instead
will vote for their more-preferred of the two extremists. If motion towards
the center by either extremist would lead supporters to expect all others
to shift their votes to a more moderate candidate (rejecting the extremist
as untrue to his ideals), then it is in fact rational for all of them to
so; the extremist then suffers from changing his position, and prefers
to remain at the extreme.</P>

<P>Cox&nbsp;(1985) argued that under approval voting, if the candidates
are free to choose their positions in a three-candidate race, then at least
one will choose the median position, and will be expected to win the election.
Subsequently, Myerson and Weber&nbsp;(1993) proposed a formal definition
of a &quot;positional equilibrium.&quot; Such an equilibrium specifies
positions for the candidates, and a voting equilibrium for the resulting
electoral situation. Furthermore, for each candidate likely to contend
for victory in the voting equilibrium, a shift in position will result
in a new situation with either a voting equilibrium in which that candidate
loses, or a voting equilibrium in which the set of likely winners is increased.
Finally, for each candidate unlikely to contend for victory, a shift in
position will not make that candidate a likely winner. Under this definition,
they are able to generalize Cox's result to elections involving any number
of candidates. They show that in an election involving any number of candidates,
at any positional equilibrium, at least one candidate will take the median
position, and the likely winner of the election will be a candidate at
that median position.</P>

<H4>Prospects</H4>

<P>Approval voting is a practical and attractive alternative to the commonly-used
plurality rule. Under plausible assumptions concerning the voters' perceptions
of the relative chances of various pairs of candidates being in contention
for victory, it never forces a voter to forgo voting for a more-preferred
candidate in order to vote for a less-preferred candidate who is considered
more likely to be in contention for victory. In the absence of polling
data, when voters can be assumed to vote sincerely, it is more effective
(in the three-candidate case) than either the plurality rule or Borda's
rule in leading to an election outcome which well-represents the preferences
of the electorate. In the classical three-candidate setting in which two
similar candidates share the support of a majority of the voters, and a
candidate preferred only by a minority of the electorate might win under
the plurality rule, approval voting will not (at equilibrium) ever have
the minority candidate emerge as the clear victor. Finally, the use of
approval voting encourages candidates to take moderate positions.</P>

<P>Approval voting has been tried in a number of settings, and has proven
to be successful, at least in the sense that it continues to be used. Given
the well-known potential problems associated with use of the plurality
rule when more than two candidates run for a single office, it seems inevitable
that the use of approval voting will continue to spread.</P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 1"></A>1. We focus our attention on elections in which
a single candidate must be elected. Our representation of voter preferences
includes the tacit assumption that the voters care only about who wins,
and not about the relative sizes of the candidates' vote totals.</P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 2"></A>2. More precisely, we assume that the probability
that a change of <B>dv</B>&nbsp;=&nbsp;v<SUB>i</SUB>-v<SUB>j</SUB>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0
in the relative vote totals of candidates i and j will change the winner
of the election from candidate j to candidate i is perceived to vary linearly
in <B>dv</B>, and that the close-race probabilities are a common rescaling
of the constants of proportionality. With these assumptions, a voter's
decision problem is to choose the vote vector v&nbsp;=&nbsp;(v<SUB>1</SUB>,
v<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., v<SUB>k</SUB>) which maximizes <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/payoffs1.gif" HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=171 ALIGN=ABSCENTER VALIGN=BASELINE>this
expression simplifies to a constant multiple of <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/payoffs2.gif" HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 3"></A>3. In the terms used in the previous note, the
objective function then simplifies to a constant multiple of <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/payoffs3.gif" HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=95 ALIGN=ABSCENTER>where
<IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/payoffs4.gif" HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=90 ALIGN=ABSCENTER>&nbsp;is the
mean of the utilities of all candidates to the voter. </P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 4"></A>4. A voter's &quot;prospective ranking&quot;
of candidate i is <IMG SRC="https://rangevoting.org/payoffs5.gif" HEIGHT=29 WIDTH=106 ALIGN=ABSCENTER>Under
the plurality rule, a (strategic) voter will vote for the candidate with
the greatest prospective ranking. </P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 5"></A>5. Indeed, this monotonicity property characterizes
approval voting.</P>

<P><A NAME="Endnote 6"></A>6. It is important to note that strength-of-preference
as used here does not refer to interpersonal comparisons of utility. Rather,
voters in the first group have a less-strong preference for one candidate
over the other in this election than they might in other elections. </P>
