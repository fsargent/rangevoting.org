<h3> Introductory Results Summary </h3>
<p>
We <a href=" NonlinQuality.html">previously</a> had identified,
as a (the?) top open problem in multiwinner voting systems, whether
a "holy grail" such system exists.  The main properties asked of the holy grail
were that
</p><ol><li>
 it have "<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a> style" ballots (or their simpler
degenerate case,  "<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> style" ballots)
</li><li>
 it be "party-free" 
(i.e. not assuming/demanding the existence of,
or anything about the internal structure of, political parties);
</li><li>
it elect the "optimum" parliament, meaning the one maximizing some specified
computable continuous "quality function" Q (and one could also demand, more strongly, that
Q be, not merely continuous, but actually <i>smooth</i>, for your favorite
notion of smoothness);
</li><li>
this quality function should be such that the method is "monotonic" 
<!-- [QUESTION: and "participatory"??] -->
(e.g. a voter, by raising her score for some candidate X, must increase Q for
all X-containing parliaments while leaving Q unaltered for X-omitting parliaments);
and 
</li><li>
it obey 
"<a href="NonlinQuality.html#strongPRthm">strong</a>
proportional representation (<a href="PropRep.html">PR</a>)."
</li></ol><p>
Here &quot;<a href="#basicpr">basic PR</a>&quot;
means that in scenarios consisting of "colored" candidates and voters
and featuring "maximally racist" voting behavior, the parliament will be guaranteed to
have the same color-composition as the electorate &ndash; up to errors of order &plusmn;1 seat
per color, i.e. of the same order forced by integer roundoff demands, and provided
enough candidates of each color run (e.g. we cannot elect 5 Greens if only 3 run).
</p><p><small>
To be clear: the voting system <i>never</i> knows and is never told
the colors of any voter or any candidate,
it only knows the votes.  And there is no requirement for any voters to vote
in "color-like" fashion.  We are merely demanding that <i>if</i> they do,
<i>then</i> proportional representation with respect to colors, must happen.
</small></p><p>
"Strong PR" means if we add uncolored candidates
&ndash; whose ratings depend only on the candidate and not on the voter &ndash;
to that picture, then the
<i>colored subset</i> of the parliament will be guaranteed to
have the same composition as the electorate. 
As bonus properties, it would be pleasant if the voting method
</p><ol start="6"><li>
reduce to <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, aka score voting, in
the single-winner subcase;
</li><li>
be computationally efficient;
</li><li>
??
</li></ol>
<p>
It originally seemed as though the holy grail were impossible, and indeed Smith had been
able to produce impossibility proofs under certain ansatzes.
</p><p>
However, the present paper succeeds in finding <i>three</i> holy grail systems.
The <a href="#hg1">first</a>, which is the simplest to define and program, 
unfortunately is computationally very laborious &ndash; the work grows like W!V, note the
factorial sign,  merely to evaluate Q for a specified W-member parliament (V voters).
</p><p>
The <a href="#hg2">second</a>, which unfortunately is the most
complicated to define (it involves numerically solving
a system of ordinary differential equations as a sub-algorithm!), 
involves a quality function Q which should be
evaluable to D decimal places of accuracy 
in a number of steps bounded by (V+1)polynomial(C,T,D)
for a W-winner, V-voter, C-candidate election.
Here T is the number of "transitions" within the algorithm, which hopefully 
usually is small, e.g.
upper bounded by polynomial(C).  
Unfortunately we are unable to rule out the possibility
that T might be exponentially large, e.g. have the same order as 2<sup>W</sup>.  
The situation is analogous to 
the "simplex algorithm" for linear programming
(Dantzig 1963).
In practice, 
simplex experimentally virtually always runs in a polynomially bounded number of steps,
<i>but</i> examples have been artificially constructed 
which cause exponential runtime.
</p><p><small>
The first such construction was by Klee &amp; Minty 1972.
Over the next few decades, various 
fancier "pivot rules" were proposed that hopefully would allow simplex
to dodge the exponential examples, plus in some cases made simplex perform
experimentally better.  But as the decades rolled by,
virtually every promising-seeming deterministic pivot rule
was defeated by some (sometimes quite complicated) artificial exptime example:
Jeroslow 1973, Goldfarb &amp; Sit 1979, and 
Friedmann 2011, and
Freidman-Hansen-Zwick 2011a, 2011b.
<!--
One pivot rule that still
(at least as of 2016) survives
the assault by constructors of exptime counterexamples,
is Zadeh 2008's "re-entry avoiding" pivot rule &ndash; but 
and 
also several randomized pivot rules <i>might</i>
be able to assure polynomial <i>expected</i> runtime,
see 
G&auml;rtner, Henk, Ziegler 1998.
-->
Historically, that simplex method quagmire 
was dodged when so-called "interior point methods" (IPMs) were invented which
guarantee polynomial runtime bounds for
linear programming.  
Also, Kelner &amp; Spielman 2006 eventually found
a randomized algorithm, whose "simplexity" is arguable, with a polynomial bound
on expected runtime. But in both, the
polynomial was <i>not</i> of the number of dimensions and constraints,
but instead based on the number of <i>bits</i> of input.
We have been unable to find an analogue of either
IPM or Kelner/Spielman for the voting method we are speaking
of here, and do not know whether one exists.
</small></p><p>
A <a href="#hg3">third</a> 
holy grail scheme called PAMSAC was invented by Toby Pereira after S&amp;S showed him
their first one.  We'll generalize,
re-describe and re-prove it.
Pereira's original PAMSAC cost function Q had impractically enormous
computational requirements &ndash; exponential in VW+C,
where V is the number of voters, C of candidates, and W of winners.
We however shall show how to compute the PAMSAC Q function to
D-decimal accuracy in time&le;polynomial(V,W,D)
<i>provided</i> V&ge;2<sup>W</sup>; and by replacing the "CFAT" inside it by a
"slimmed CFAT" this proviso may be weakened to V&gt;6(W+1)W, 
which effectively means there no longer is any proviso.
Further, we have certain heuristic randomized algorithm speedups which
(we argue nonrigorously) 
should reduce the runtime bound to V&middot;polynomial(W,D) in almost all realistic elections
&ndash; in other words enjoying linear growth with V if W and D are held fixed.
</p><p>
Along the way to producing our holy grails, we present two new
strong-PR voting systems that are both simple 
and computationally efficient (polynomial time): MSPAV
(multiplicative sequential proportional approval voting),
and MSPRV
(" " " range ").
Neither enjoys the full set of Holy Grail properties, but
they are simple and they do enjoy strong PR.

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p>
Parts 
<a href="QualityMulti.html">I</a>
and
<a href="NonlinQuality.html">II</a>
of this series had 
investigated "optimizing" multiwinner voting systems.
I.e. let there be V voters, C candidates, W winners, 
0&lt;W&lt;C, usually in practice C&ll;V, and in which the ballots were 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a>-style
or, more simply, <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style.
(Score: each voter scores each candidate with a real number 
from 0 [undesired] to 1 [desired].
Approval: the only permitted scores are 0 [disapproved] and 1 [approved], 
intermediate reals are forbidden.)
</p><p>
Define a continuous (or more smooth) <b>"quality function"</b> Q
of the scores on the ballots and the winner-set.
For approval-style ballots there are only 2<sup>C</sup> possible ballot-types, and
we can demand Q be a continuous function of the 2<sup>C</sup> different counts, now regarded 
as real numbers.  For score-style ballots we'll assume continuum scores, i.e.
each voter scores each candidate with a real number from the interval [0,1],
and demand Q be a continuous function of all those scores.
</p><p>
The voting method is to elect the W-element subset of the candidates that maximizes Q.
(Sometimes we prefer to <i>minimize</i> Q, in which case it is better referred to
as a "cost" or "penalty" function.)
We'd previously stated various properties such multiwinner voting systems might or might not obey.
The "holy grail" combination of properties was singled out for special attention as both 
particularly desirable, and which nobody had managed to attain.  
Smith suspected it was impossible.
</p><p>
We here attain the holy grail, indeed we have found 3 different holy grail voting methods.
However, our <a href="#hg1">first</a> and simplest holy grail voting method
comes about in a rather unexpected and somewhat nasty way.
</p><p>
All our previous failed attempts to design holy grail voting methods had 
involved rather "natural" and "nice" Q, which could be evaluated
from the V ballots and the W winning candidates
via a straightforward polynomial-time computation.  Indeed, the number of
computational steps to compute Q was bounded by an
expression of form O(VClogC) at most.
Unfortunately finding the <i>optimum</i> parliament, maximizing Q,
was shown to be NP-hard &ndash; and not only for our Q's, but also
for essentially <i>any</i> voting method achieving "optimal"
proportional representation (PR), for <i>any</i> reasonable notion of "optimal."
And this also was shown for various merely-approximate optimality notions.
In other words, brute force evaluation of Q for every 
possible parliament, then picking the best, is in some sense necessary
for any good-performing PR voting method.  There is no quick way to shortcut
that to rapidly produce the optimum parliment, and any attempt to
try will unavoidably, in at least some elections, produce poor results. (Unless P=NP.)
</p><p>
But we were willing to accept that need for heavy computation, for several reasons:
</p><ol><li>
It was, by theorem, unavoidable (unless P=NP).
</li><li>
The search could be programmed to run in O(V) work per possible-parliament &ndash; 
very fast on a per-parliament basis.
</li><li>
The "parliament quality" function Q, evaluated at the optimum,
could be published and easily verified by anybody, and
(if wrong or non-maximal) potentially refutable by anybody, and
with rapid verification of the counterexample (once found)
by anybody.
</li><li>
There were <a href="QualityMulti.html#stratvote">arguments</a>
that <i>if</i> the computational needs were so heavy they might
not be feasible, then we should not have been conducting a multiwinner 
election with those parameters anyway,
because it would be inherently ultra-vulnerable to "strategic voting."
</li><li>
We could allow each voter, and perhaps other interest groups (parties? media?)
to submit suggested-parliaments to the election authority, which could
then elect the highest-Q suggestion (plus possibly awarding
a money prize to that suggester).  This would not necessarily
produce the greatest-Q possible parliament, but that would "not be the
election authority's fault."
</li></ol>
<p>
The first holy grail scheme developed in the present paper, however, makes this situation worse.
Its quality function Q no longer appears to be polynomial-time computable!
It <a href="#likelyNPhard">likely</a>
is NP-hard to compute, and perhaps even computing it approximately is NP-hard.
The entire optimization problem
(finding the Q-maximizing parliament) is no longer merely an NP-hard task, it instead
lies in the complexity class NP<sup>NP</sup> (next level up within
the "polynomial hierarchy").   Once the optimum parliament is
found, it is neither easily verified nor easily refuted, albeit it still 
should be a lot easier to compute its Q value than it is to perform the full optimization.
</p><p>
This all was rather annoying and led us to wonder 
whether this "next level" computational complexity was
somehow inherent and unavoidable for any holy grail voting method.
</p><p>
We then devised a <a href="#hg2">second</a>
holy grail method which made us suspect that it wasn't.
Specifically, we showed its
Q function was evaluable to D-decimal accuracy a number of arithmetic operations
bounded by polynomial(V,W,D,T), where T
seemed plausibly likely to almost-always be upper bounded by polynomial(W).
</p><p>
Finally, we found a third
holy grail method with Q function genuinely evaluable in
time bounded by polynomial(V,W,D).
With this voting method optimizing Q once again is a mere coNP&cup;NP problem.
</p><p>
But unfortunately, this third method is complicated to explain and 
to program for a computer,
and the polynomials governing its runtime and memory usage both are rather large.
Our second method is probably the most feasible for practical use, but it 
is very complicated to explain.
</p><p>
It unexpectedly turned out to be crucial for inventing all
of these schemes to study several interesting kinds of <b>"transforms"</b>
which convert multiwinner voting methods into different ones.
CROSSREFS??
In the previous papers we already discussed the 
"<a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>"
of a set of score-ballots into a weighted set of approval-type ballots,
and "coin-flip approval" transforms which convert a
set of approval-type ballots into a 
different weighted set of approval-type ballots.
(Despite the latter's name, both are wholy deterministic.)
Both shall be used here.  Indeed, we shall focus entirely on
the problem of inventing voting methods using <i>approval</i> ballots, because score-type
ballots can then be handled via an initial 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>.
And for our second holy grail method we shall also employ the new "infinite-cloning transform,"
which seems the most remarkable among these ideas.
</p><p>
So the holy grail problem now seems completely solved from the standpoint of theory,
but in practice our solutions may be unacceptable in the sense that 
hardly any politicians and voters would be willing/able to understand them, and/or the
computational memory and/or time complexities would be too great.
That quite likely would render them, as a practical matter, unenactible.
</p><p>
If so, the <b>question for future authors</b> becomes: 
is there some holy grail voting method enjoying <i>both</i> the simplicity of
description (or simpler!) of our first solution, and better computational efficiency
than we've so far managed to attain?

<h3> Multiplicative sequential proportional approval voting (MSPAV) </h3>

<!--
<p>
This multiwinner voting system was invented by Forest W. Simmons in December 2015,
albeit the version we present here is a little different than his.
</p>
-->
<p>
Algorithm definition:
</p><blockquote>
<p><b>1.</b>
Each voter, as her ballot, <i>approves</i> or <i>disapproves</i> each candidate.

the common initial weight of each of the ballots be 1
(unless they were already weighted a priori).  
These weights will remain nonnegative throughout the process.

(and let that weighted approval be A).

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Remarks.</b> Q is <i>unused</i> and hence its update in step 3.2 and 
initialization in step 2 both may be <i>jettisoned</i>.  
The purpose of Q is, at algorithm termination, to 
provide a numerical measure of the "<i>quality</i>" of the election result, and
different such quality-measures can be got by use of different "mono(x)" functions.
Here mono(x) is assumed to be some particular continuous monotone function of x&ge;0,
most simply mono(x)=x, but we also could consider, e.g, mono(x)=x<sup>-1/2</sup>.
For purposes of the present section (since the algorithm does not ever use Q) 
it does not matter what mono(x) is.  
However, <a href="#failgrail">later</a> we shall have purposes in mind for using
Q, and at that point we shall care.
</p><p>
In step 3.3 the test "if A&gt;0" can be jettisoned if we know a priori that every candidate
is approved by at least one voter (e.g. by themselves).  Such elections have been called 
"narcissistic."
</p>
<a name="strongpr1"></a>
<p>
The main <b>theorem</b> about MSPAV is that it obeys "strong PR."
That is: 
</p>
<ol><li>
<a name="basicpr"></a>
The method obeys <b>"basic PR"</b>:  
If each voter and candidate is "colored" and each voter approves
exactly the candidates of the same color as that voter ("maximal racism"), then (provided enough
candidates of each color run) the parliament automatically will have
the same color composition as the electorate (up to small errors forced by integer
roundoff requirements, since we refuse to cut MPs in half).
<blockquote><small>
Terminology note: 
"Partisanship" may be a more appropriate descriptor than "racism."  
(And, e.g, "racist voting"&harr;"party-slate voting," etc.)
We chose the "colored" terminology to emphasize the point that "color" could be <i>anything</i> &ndash;
e.g. gender, militarism &ndash; and does
<i>not</i> necessarily correspond to political party identity.
Indeed, the goal is to design voting methods that work regardless of 
whether political parties even exist, and the definition of "work" similarly
does not require political parties to exist.
</small>
</blockquote>
</li><li>
Further, if there also are <b>universally-approved (uncolored)</b> candidates, then
MSPAV first elects them and then colored MPs; whereupon the colored MPs will, 
if considered by themselves, obey basic PR.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Proof.</b>
The key is the formula for F.  
It was obtained by solving
</p><center>
 SA/U = (S-1)A'/U' + 1 = (S-1)(AF)/(U-A+AF) + 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  for &nbsp;&nbsp; F.
</center><p>
Here the lefthand side is the number of seats (from among the S seats remaining to be filled)
that would be proportionately "deserved" by the faction supporting the elected candidate X,
under maximal-racism conditions.  The primed quantities A' and U' denote A and U
<i>after</i> the deweighting by multiplying the weights of all X-approving ballots by F;
the point is that
<nobr>(S-1)A'/U'+1</nobr>
should <i>also</i> give the number of seats that faction proportionately deserves.
The equality of that and SA/U, by induction, guarantees basic PR.
We then note that A'=AF and U'=U-A+AF.
Upon solving the resulting equation for F, we find the <b>naive reweighting factor formula</b>
</p><center>
F<sub>naive</sub> = 1 - A<sup>-1</sup>U/S.
</center><p>
Unfortunately, this naive formula can become <b>negative</b>, 
which occurs when no candidate has 
enough approval to "deserve" a seat, but nevertheless 
we must elect one, so we do.
Negative reweighting factors seem to be something we should avoid,
since otherwise the algortihm will start awarding seats with the goal of
<i>intentionally hurting</i>
factions, without accomplishing anything positive.
(If F-values always are nonnegative, then given that all approvals begin
nonnegative, they will stay that way forever.)
Even F=0 seems something we usually want to avoid, because we want
to avoid situations where various factions have zero weighted approval,
so that their approval will stay zero forevermore, giving us no way to decide
which among them should win the next seat.
</p><p>
So the question is how best to modify the naive formula in those
problematic regimes.
Here are some <b>desiderata</b> (for the following discussion regard &Delta;=0;
we will discuss nonzero &Delta; later):
</p>
<ol><li>
Always 0&lt;F&lt;1.
</li><li>
F should be <i>monotonically increasing</i> as a function of A/U&ge;0
with S&ge;2 held fixed.
</li><li>
F should agree (either exactly, or with error sufficiently small not to matter)
with the naive formula when SA/U is large enough; it
should only differ when SA/U is so small that this faction (naively speaking) 
"deserves" few or no further seats.
</li><li>
F should be <i>continuous</i> as a function of A, U, and S.
(And more strongly, perhaps we also should demand some degree of <i>smoothness</i>.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that F<sub>1</sub>=max(1-h,&frac12;)    
obeys all the preceding desiderata, agreeing with the naive formula
for factions deserving &ge;2 more seats &ndash;
but causing deweighting by a factor of 2 from then onwards.
And this 
is continuous across h=&frac12;.  We could also 
<a href="#altbreakpt">consider</a>, say,
<nobr>max(1-h,&frac13;)</nobr>
which agrees with the naive formula
for factions deserving &ge;3/2 more seats.
</li><li>
(S-1)A'/U' must always be less than SA/U, so that a faction
never "deserves" more seats after it gets a new seat!
This demand forces
<nobr>F&lt;(U-A)S/([S-1]U-AS).</nobr>
</li><li>
When SA/U&lt;1 then one perhaps might
further demand that
(S-1)A'/U' always be &le;SA/(2U),
i.e. after a faction that naively deserves &lt;1 more seat
wins a new seat, it then always thinks it deserves
at most <i>half</i> the seats it did before.
<!-- That means  F &le; (U-A)S/(2[S-1]U-AS) ?? -->
This would suggest solving
<center>
max(SA/U - 1, SA/(2U)) = (S-1)A'/U'  = (S-1)(AF)/(U-A+AF)
</center>
for F to obtain the formula
<center>
F<sub>4</sub> = max{ 1-U/(SA), (U-A)S/(2[S-1]U-AS) }.
</center>
</li></ol>
<!--
We therefore instead use F<sub>1</sub>=max(F,&frac12;),
which prevents F<sub>1</sub> from ever getting below &frac12;.
This causes any faction with &le;2 quotas worth of approval, i.e. "deserving"
&le;2 more seats,
to be deweighted by a factor &frac12; from then on.  This won't change anything
<i>except</i> that if at some point all factions have too little weighted-approval to
"deserve" election, then behavior improves (e.g. no negative weights).
-->
<p>
Also, note that rather than needing a fraction 1/S of the V voters to approve you 
(in maximal racism basic-PR situations) to "deserve" one of the S seats,
one arguably "deserves" a seat with
only <nobr>&lfloor;V/(S+1)&rfloor;+1</nobr> votes.
This formula is known as the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota">Droop quota</a>,"
as opposed to the more naive formula
V/S, which is the "Hare quota."  
These are named after 
Thomas Hare (1806-1891) and Henry R. Droop (1832-1884),
two of the early investigators of proportional representation mathematics.
Droop's point was that at most S candidates could each acquire a Droop quota under
plurality-style "name one candidate" voting.
The main difference between Hare and Droop is 
the use of S+1 rather than S,
and one could also consider S+&Delta; for any constant &Delta; to get still other
proportionality notions.
When we do both that and the max(h,&frac12;) trick, then we get
<nobr>F<sub>1</sub>=max{1-A<sup>-1</sup>U/(S+&Delta;),&frac12;},</nobr>
and more generally any of our formulas with &Delta;=0 are appropriately
converted by replacing S by (S+&Delta;) everywhere inside them, e.g. 
</p><center>
F<sub>4</sub> = max{ 1-U/([S+&Delta;]A), (U-A)[S+&Delta;]/(2[S+&Delta;-1]U-A[S+&Delta;]) }.

Finally, we note that MSPAV will always elect universally-approved candidates in preference
to any candidate approved by only some of the voters, and whenever it does so, then
<i>all</i> ballots are deweighted by the <i>same</i> factor F.
Therefore, MSPAV obeys not just basic, but actually <i>strong</i> PR.
(Actually, of course, it does not matter for this purpose what deweighting factor F&gt;0 
is used whenever a universally-approved candidate is elected.)
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Remarks:</b>
Note F<sub>1</sub> is continuous, positive and non-increasing 
for all real h.
The formulas F<sub>2</sub> 
and F<sub>3</sub> 
similarly were devised also to equal 1-h when 0&le;h&le;&frac12;
(i.e. for factions naively deserving &ge;2 more seats)
but now also enjoying continuous h-<i>derivative</i>
for all real h.  Note both F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> are positive and decreasing 
for all real h,  and F<sub>2</sub> goes to 0, but F<sub>3</sub> goes to 1/4, 
when h&rarr;&infin;.
The differences between these formulae hopefully do not matter in the 
sense that in "racist voting" scenarios they
only change seat counts for color classes which "deserve less than 2 seats."  In other
words, proportionality remains valid up to 
acceptable errors with one formula, if that were true with another.
<a name="altbreakpt"></a>
The above formula-surgeries 
F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>
all were devised based on h=&frac12; (i.e. 2 naively deserved seats)
as the breakpoint; we also could consider the <b>alternative breakpoint "3/2 seats"</b>
in which case those formulae would instead become
</p><center>
         F<sub>1b</sub> = max(1-h, &frac13;);
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         F<sub>2b</sub> = 1-h if h&le;&frac13;, else 3<sup>-1</sup>+[9h]<sup>-1</sup>;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         F<sub>3b</sub> = 1-h if h&le;&frac13;, else 2<sup>-1</sup>+h<sup>-2</sup>/54.
</center>
<p>
The formula F<sub>&infin;</sub> is even smoother, namely <i>analytic</i> in h; 
it is asymptotic to
F<sub>1</sub> when S&rarr;&infin;, and equals it when h=&frac12;, and
F<sub>1</sub>&lt;F<sub>&infin;</sub>&lt;1
when 2-&Delta;&lt;S<&infin; and 0&lt;h&lt;&frac12;.
Unfortunately F<sub>&infin;</sub>&notin;[0,1]
when S-2+&Delta;&lt;0.
Therefore, if you want to use the F<sub>&infin;</sub> variant, insist that &Delta;&gt;0.
With that restriction,
every deweighting that can actually occur (i.e. those with S&ge;2) will obey
0&lt;F<sub>&infin;</sub>&lt;1.
</p><p>
Among these F-formula choices, Smith personally currently prefers formula
F<sub>4</sub>?? <!-- F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>3</sub>?? -->
</p><p>
The <b>main algorithmic differences</b> between MSPAV and <a href="RRV.html">RRV</a>
(reweighted range voting, a different "sequential" proportional representation voting method
which had been invented independently by both Simmons and Smith in the early 2000s
&ndash; but which, we later found out,  in an
approval voting special case 
already had been invented in 1895 by T.N.Thiele) &ndash; are
</p><ol><li>
With MSPAV, the weighting is done <i>multiplicatively</i>;
</li><li>
MSPAV needs foreknowledge of the number of seats to be filled.
</li></ol>
<p>
RRV uses a quite different ballot weighting scheme; and RRV
does not need to know in advance how many seats are to be filled &ndash; it just
fills them one by one until we tell it to stop.
This is since MSPAV fills the seats in "backwards" order (decrementing S as it goes), if
RRV is regarded as filling them in "forwards" order.  
</p>
<!--
<p>
Another important fact about MSPAV is 
<b>time-order invariance under maximal racism.</b>
That is: MSPAV successively 
"greedily" elects the candidate with the 
greatest weighted approval in step 3.1.
However, if the same parliament had been elected in <i>any</i> other time-order with
the same deweighting formula employed (using whatever the weighted approval A
was for each successively elected candidate at his time of election) 
then <i>under conditions of maximal racism</i>,
the <i>same</i> set of MPs would be elected with
the <i>same</i> respective weighted approvals.
</p><p>
In addition to colored candidates under maximum racism,
we can also allow additional <i>uncolored universally-approved candidates</i>.
In that case, 
time-order invariance still holds <i>restricted</i>
to time-reorderings of the colored and uncolored MPs <i>only</i>.
I.e. the colored ones get shuffled among themselves arbitrarily,
and the uncolored ones also get  shuffled among themselves arbitrarily,
but no colored and uncolored MP are ever exchanged.
</p><p>
Our (later) goal will be to devise <i>optimizing</i> voting systems, which 
elect the parliament that maximizes a "quality function" Q.  
Our Q's will be such that
MSPAV can be regarded as a "greedy heuristic" striving to approximately maximize Q.
Indeed, our Q will be regardable as the summed (over all MPs) weighted approval with
the same kind of weighting and deweighting factors that MSPAV employs.
That will be explained later.  For now, we need to ask how to begin to break
out of the "greedy" one-at-a-time mindset and move toward the "global optimum" mindset.
As a good step in that direction, suppose instead of electing one candidate at a time 
(like MSPAV), we elect some number K simultaneously.  Different chunk-cardinalities K
could occur at different times during the process; we shall here concentrate on just
one particular chunk, ignoring the cardinalities and nature of the others.
</p><p>
<b>Chunk-deweighting formula:</b>
If K candidates are simultaneously elected, all of whom under maximal-racism 
conditions have the same color, then the appropriate multiplier F for
then deweighting the ballots that had approved those candidates, is
</p><center>
F = max{ 1 - K<sup>2</sup>A<sub>K</sub><sup>-1</sup>U/(S+&Delta;), 1/2 }
</center><p>
where W is the number of winners, i.e. number of seats in parliament to be filled, and
A<sub>K</sub>
is the summed (over all K of these elected candidates,
and weighted-summed over all the voters) approval, and
U is the weighted approval for a single hypothetical universally-approved candidate,
so that KU would be the summed
weighted approval for a hypothetical K-candidate set of
universally-approved candidates.
</p><p>
<b>Derivation:</b>
Solve 
</p><center>
SA<sub>K</sub>/(KU) = (S-K)(A<sub>K</sub>F)/(KU-A<sub>K</sub>+A<sub>K</sub>F) + K
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for  &nbsp;&nbsp; F  
</center><p>
where S is the number of seats still available, finding
F=K<sup>2</sup>U/(AS);  then replace S by S+&Delta;
and apply the max(x,&frac12;) function to F.
</p>
-->
<p>
<b>Runtime:</b>
With V&gt;1 voters, C candidates, W winners, 0&lt;W&lt;C,
MSPAV will run in O(CVW) steps using O(CV) words of memory.
If C is less than or equal to the word size (in bits) of the computer, then
O(V) words of memory suffice.

<h3> Multiplicative sequential proportional range voting (MSPRV) </h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>1.</b>
Each voter, as her ballot, <i>scores</i> each candidate with a real number
lying in the interval [0,1]. (Greater scores for more-preferred candidates.)
</p><p><b>2.</b>
Convert the score-style ballots to a weighted set of approval-style ballots
via the <a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>.
</p><p><b>3.</b>
Elect parliament via MSPAV.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Strong-PR theorem.</b>
MSPRV obeys basic PR. 
Further, if there also exist uncolored "<b>commonly rated candidates</b>" who are
scored the same by all voters (i.e. the score for each depends only on the 
candidate, not on the voter) then the colored subset of the parliament will 
have the same color composition as the electorate
(up to small errors forced by integer roundoff requirements,
and provided enough candidates of each color run).
</p><p>
<b>Proof.</b>
For this kind of "max-racism plus commonly-rated candidates" election,
the <a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>
converts the ballots,
for an uncolored candidate X with common-score Y,
into a weight-fraction Y of ballots which approve X,
and a weight-fraction <nobr>1-Y</nobr> of ballots which disapprove X;
where each of these two subclasses of ballots are identical
as regards all the non-X candidates.
Now if MSPRV elects X, then all X-approving ballots all are
deweighted by the <i>same</i> multiplier F, while all
the weights for X-disapproving ballots are left unaltered.
This leaves the weighted approvals for all the non-X candidates
<i=>unaltered</i>  except for an overall constant multiplicative factor.
Hence, color-proportionality within the <i>colored portion</i> of parliament is
unaffected by the election (or not) of X.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
Even more strongly, MSPRV enjoys <b>"subfaction proportionality."</b>
Suppose the Red Party has factions inside it.  Each faction scores 
candidates with non-Red colors, zero.
(Also all non-red colored voters score all flavors of Reds zero.
We also permit uncolored commonly rated candidates.)
But the different Red factions score various Red candidates differently.
In that case, MSPRV will, if we consider the Red-portion of parliament <i>alone</i>,
elect the same proportions of each kind of Red MP, as it would have done if the
Red voters were the only voters and the Red candidates the only candidates.  
(As usual, only up to integer roundoff and 
provided enough candidates of each type run.)
</p><p>
<b>Proof.</b>
This is because all elections of non-Red candidates deweight all Red-voter ballots
<i>equally</i>; and since all elections of Red candidates deweight all non-Red 
ballots equally.  Hence within-Red proportionality is unaffected by non-Red voters, and 
color-proportionality within non-Red colors, is unaffected by Red voters.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Monotonicity property:</b>
If a voter raises her score for some candidate X (leaving
all her other scores unaltered), that can <i>cause</i> X to be elected,
but cannot cause X to stop being elected.
</p><p>
<b>Proof.</b>
X's (weighted) approval increases, while other candidates' approvals
are unaltered.  That can cause X to get elected in some MSPAV step 3.1.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Note re "<a name="phantom">phantom voters</a>":</b>
We can regard any election as having more voters, all of whom
score all candidates 0.  If some of those "phantom voters" increase a score for
some candidate, then it is as if a new voter appeared.  And monotonicity applies
to those "appearances."
</p><p>
<b>Single-winner case:</b>
MSPAV if the parliament only has 1 seat, is just 
<a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting;
meanwhile MSPRV is just 
<a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> voting.
</p>

<h3> First holy grail scheme: MSPAV with best ordering </h3>

<p>
In MSPAV (and hence in MSPRV) the candidates are elected sequentially
<i>greedily</i>, i.e. in step 3.1 always electing the available candidate 
that increases Q by the most.  
However, if our goal were to maximize the <i>final</i> value of Q, we
might be able to do better by instead in step 3.1 picking some non-greedy choice,
hoping that this would permit later seat-elections to increase Q by more
than enough to compensate.  Or, conceivably, electing the same parliament but in a
different (non-greedy) time-order also might allow increasing Q.
</p><p>
Also note that if in some MSPAV step 3.1 we did <i>not</i> elect the greedy candidate,
but rather somebody else, that would still be ok in the sense that the F formulas
would then automatically perform the correct reweightings
to make the algorithm strive to restore proportionality &ndash; and indeed 
will always succeed &ndash;
i.e. still will generate a strong PR parliament given a racism+uncolored voting scenario 
&ndash; provided
the artificially-forced MPs do not create overrepresentation of some color thus
making that impossible.
</p><p>
To pursue this idea, consider the following algorithm, which 
given a set of weighted approval ballots (or,
via the <a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>, score-style ballots)
and a tuple 
</p><center>
(M<sub>W</sub>, M<sub>W-1</sub>, ...,  M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>)
</center><p>
of the W members, listed in 
some specific order, of a putative parliament, computes a real-valued
<b>quality measure Q</b> for that ordered-parliament with those ballots.  (Note,
this Q can depend on the ordering.)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Q-computing algorithm</b>: 
Input is V <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style
ballots and a putative <i>ordered</I> W-member parliament
(M<sub>W</sub>, M<sub>W-1</sub>, ...,  M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>).
</p><p><b>1.</b>
Let Q=0 and S=W and let each
ballot initially have weight 1
(unless they are already weighted a priori).
Fix a constant &Delta;&gt;-1; here &Delta;=1/2 seems appropriate for
Sainte-Lag&uuml;e-like and &Delta;=1 for d'Hondt-like PR behavior.
</p><p><b>2.</b>
Loop:
</p><ol><li>
Suppose M<sub>S</sub> has weighted approval A, while
a hypothetical candidate
approved by every voter who approved any member of parliament
would have

</li><li>
Q&larr;Q+mono(A); &nbsp; If S&le;1 then return Q and stop.
</li><li>
If A&gt;0 then:
Multiply the weights of each ballot that approved M<sub>S</sub> by F, where 0&le;F&le;1 is
given by the same 
<a href="#deweightformula">formulas</a> stated in MSPVA step 3.3.
</li><li>
Decrement S.
</li></ol>
<p>
EndLoop.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We assume that mono(x) is a known continuous 
function <i>monotonic</i> on  reals x&ge;0.
</p><p>
The <b>first holy grail</b> election method, 
then, is to elect the ordered parliament (selected from
among all possible W-member parliaments <i>and</i>
all W! possible orderings of each parliament)
that, if mono(x) is monotonic-<i>in</i>creasing, <i>max</i>imizes Q.  
[If, however,
mono(x) were monotonic-<i>de</i>creasing, then it instead would be appropriate
to <i>min</i>imize Q.
But to keep the present arguments simple we shall, 
without loss of generality, assume mono(x) is increasing and Q is
maximized &ndash; because otherwise we could simply negate both mono(x) and Q.]
Different quality measures Q result from different mono(x) functions.
</p><p>
What properties does this election method have?
</p><ol><li>
Q is a <i>continuous</i>
function of the scores on the ballots.  
Proof: The max of a finite number of continuous functions is a continuous function.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<small>
Incidentally, it is well known that the L<sub>p</sub> norm
of a finite set of nonnegative reals tends, in the limit p&rarr;&infin;, to their maximum.
Therefore, anybody who is unsatisfied with mere continuity, and wants more
smoothness, could get it by letting Q for an <i>un</i>ordered parliament
be the L<sub>p</sub> norm of the Q's for its W! possible orderings 
&ndash; we elect the parliament with maximum Q &ndash; using some finite p
large enough so that the other properties we want cannot be destroyed, at least not to
within acceptable &plusmn;1 seat errors.
</small>
</li><li>
The holy grail obeys strong PR.
Proof: suppose it didn't.  Then in some election consisting solely of
colored candidates with maximally-racist voters, 
<i>plus</i> (optionally) commonly-rated uncolored candidates,
at least two colors would be disproportionally represented.
Suppose red is the most-overrepresented color
and blue the most-underrepresented.  There are two cases:
<ol type="i"><li>
The last blue came chronologically <u>after</u> the last red.
Then we claim
Q could be increased by <i>not</i> electing the chronologically last red, 
and electing one extra blue as the chronologically last seat.
This is an "edit"
of the supplied time-ordered list of MPs consisting of
one red deletion, one blue append, and 
(therefore) a shift-one-seat-earlier
of the chain of MPs lying chronologically between them.
The unelection of the last red of course increases A for all future <i>un</i>colored seats
by eliminating what would have been a deweighting.  
(No <i>colored</i> seat's approval is affected.)
It also increases S&rarr;S+1 for all future seats, which increases all their F
multipliers too.
The election of the extra blue, however, has no opposite-sign effects on the future
because it, being chronologically last, has no future.
And since by assumption blue is the most-underrepresented party, blue will be the greedy
choice [maximum weighted approval A, hence maximum mono(A), hence maximally increasing Q]
for the last seat.
Hence the net effect on
Q is clearly to increase it &ndash; <i>except</i> that one might worry
about that deleted red.  But since by assumption the reds are the most over-represented party,
the chronologically <i>last</i> red's election clearly was the exact opposite of "greedy,"
i.e. any other-color candidate by being elected instead at that moment, would have increased Q.
So this worry does not destroy the proof.
</li><li>
The last blue came chronologically <u>before</u> the last red.
In this case we claim
Q could be increased by <i>replacing</i> the election of the chronologically last red
by a blue.  (A "point mutation" edit, in biological DNA terminology.)
Since by assumption the reds are the most-overrepresented party
and the blues the most-underrepresented &ndash; <i>and</i> by &gt;1 extra seat &ndash;
this change clearly used greater A and hence
will clearly increase F, i.e. the blues deserved this
seat more than reds.  (Our definition of "deserves more" is "has greater weighted approval."
Similarly for notion of "most underrepresented.")
Thenceforth all A's and hence F's
for all future <i>un</i>colored candidates will increase.
Future <i>colored</i> A's will not be affected, except for reds and blues.
But since by assumption this was the last red after the last blue, 
there are no reds and blues in the "future."
All these effects caused by our edit are Q-increasing.
</li></ol>
Either way, Q increases, contradicting the original assumption that Q was maximal.
Since contradictions are impossible, we must have had strong PR.
</li><li>
The holy grail is monotonic.
Proof:
If a voter increases her score for candidate X
(leaving all her other scores unaltered) then
plainly that leaves Q for an X-omitting parliament unaltered.  
But we'll now see it increases Q for any X-containing ordered parliament.
X's election is with more approval A.
The future (chronologically after X) candidates can then be regarded as a
multiwinner election with fewer seats to fill, and fewer candidates &ndash;
but with ballot-weights <i>altered</i> 
so that every elected candidate gets <i>more</i> (or the same) approval,
because the X-caused F increased.
So we can then argue inductively about this sub-election,
using inductively assumed monotonicity  (possibly including
"<a href="#phantom">phantom</a> voter" monotonicity):
it also can only increase Q.
This induction on S terminates when there are S&le;2 seats left, 
because monotonicity is obvious
for elections of W-winner parliaments with W=1 or W=2.
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>Was that too facile?</b>
The above reasoning has (dangerously) hidden the effect of the 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>.
We claim the above proof was ok provided all Holy Grail ballots were <i>approval style</i>, 
i.e. there was no Kotze-Pereira transform.  
But one might worry the Kotze-Pereira-transform is potentially ruining both parts 1 and 3
of the proof.
Example: with the KP transform,
as you raise X's score above Y's on your ballot:
</p><ul><li>
<i>before</i>
 we had YX and Y approval-ballots with the weight of XY's rising and the weight of
Y's <i>shrinking</i> (summed weight remaining fixed); at the crossover we have only XY;
</li><li>
<i>after</i> we have XY and X only with X's rising and XY's staying at the same weight.
Such crossovers are continuous events, so proof part 1 still is ok.
</li></ul><p>
The Y-shrinkage phase is worrying re proof part 3.   (The others are ok.)
But this is ok; the summed-weight staying fixed
means the deweighting effect of Y caused by X's election (with greater F), 
<i>stays fixed</i> thanks to the following identity
</p><center>
(1-r/A)A+(q-A)
=
A-r+q-A
=
q-r
</center><p>
which is <i>independent</i> of A.
Here (1-r/A)A is the naively-deweighted approval A for X (actually for XY
before the crossover) while (q-A)
is the approval for Y 
(but for XY after the crossover) with the sum (q-A)+A remaining fixed.
Our point is that the quantities here denoted r and q both stay fixed
as some X-score rises during the pre-crossover phase.  
Therefore q-r stays fixed.
Therefore the net effect of both changing the ratings-style ballots (via a continuous
motion over a positive timespan), and electing X, and (therefore) deweighting,
is to leave the net weighted approval for Y unaffected &ndash; as we should.
</p><p>
So this identity proves the theorem, at least when the naive reweighting factor formula
is being used.  "Surgical alterations" of the reweighting factor formula
could alter that &ndash; but we assume those only are invoked (and only can be invoked)
once all parties have already gotten all the seats they "deserve." 
In that case violations of strong PR are <i>bounded</i>
by the number of seats that can be awarded to a party after that point.
If our "surgical alterations" were designed keep that number small, e.g. bounded
by some absolute constant, in all "racist voting plus commonly rated candidates"
scenarios &ndash; or if we do not care about violating strong PR in such situations &ndash;
that is ok.
</p><p>
So the proof is now complete.
</p>
<p>
<b>Runtime:</b>
With V voters, C candidates, W winners, 0&lt;W&lt;C,
the Holy Grail scheme, assuming approval-style ballots, 
can be made (using "incremental" algorithm techniques,
cf. Arndt 2011)
to run in O(W!V) steps using O(V) words of memory
to compute Q for any given W-member ordered parliament;
and hence by brute force consideration of every possible ordered parliament
in O(C!V/(C-W)!) steps to find the optimum (Q-maximizing) parliament.
</p><p>
With score-style ballots, the 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a> requires an initial
O(VC) steps to convert them into &le;min(VC,2<sup>C</sup>)
weighted approval-style ballots.
</p><p>
<b>How outrageously slow is that?</b>
We would prefer it if the Holy Grail for approval-style ballots somehow
could be made to run about W! times faster, i.e. if the Q-computing algorithm had
runtime&le;polynomial(V,C).  
Call that desire a <b>polynomially-efficient holy grail.</b>
(We'll achieve it later, but for the moment we want to demonstrate
that it is unclear whether it is possible.)
</p><p>
We have <a href="QualityMulti.html#X3C">elsewhere</a>
presented arguments that for "optimum PR" elections it is
inherently NP-hard to find an optimum parliament, and
<a href="QualityMulti.html#MVC">indeed</a>
even to attain  approximate optimality.
So a certain amount of brute force computing is <i>necessary</i>
to perform optimum PR elections.
</p><a name="likelyNPhard"></a><p>
However, the above Holy Grail scheme worsens that picture
by now employing a
Q function (quality measure) which is hard even to <i>evaluate</i> for
a wholy-known parliament!
We indeed might well speculate that our particular Q is <i>NP-hard</i> to
evaluate, perhaps even NP-hard to approximately evaluate.
The basis for the first speculation is that
&quot;minimum feedback 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set">arc set</a>&quot;
(and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set">vertex set</a>)
and 
&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut">max cut</a>&quot;
and "sparsest cut,"
maximum and minimum "linear arrangement,"
and the "traveling salesman problem"
all are known NP-complete problems that 
look related to the problem of finding the Q-maximizing ordering of a parliament with the
present section's definition of Q.
</p><p>
The basis for the stronger speculation is the observation that known results
(Amb&uuml;hl et al 2011; Crescenzi, Kann et al 1998+;
Orponen &amp; Mannila 1990;
Engebretsen &amp; Karpinski 2006)
indicate that (subject to very-believed computer science conjectures)
there exists a constant &kappa;&gt;1
such that the versions of those problems that correspond best to the 
Q-<i>max</i>imizing problem, namely <i>min</i>imum feedback vertex and arc sets,
<i>min</i>imum linear arrangement,
<i>sparsest</i> cut, 
and traveling salesman problem with  edge costs {1,2} only,
<i>all</i> are inapproximable to within factor &kappa;
via polynomial time algorithms.
That vaguely suggests that perhaps the holier grail might be unattainable.  Specifically,
no matter how you tried to design a polynomial-time-computable quality function Q, those
results suggest it would inherently be unable to approximate the present section's
holy grail Q 
well enough.   That suggests the whole approach of trying to emulate our
holy grail function, approximately, via something faster, is doomed to failure.
</p><p>
Any polynomial-time efficient Q
defining a holy grail voting method, 
if one exists, therefore would need to have a quality function Q
quite different from ours.
Which is, in fact, exactly what is going to happen.

<p>
In all the above elections
there are exactly two political parties, "A" and "B";
and exactly 12 seats in the parliament. We use &Delta;=&frac12;.
In the table on the left, we use mono(x)=x and F<sub>&infin;</sub>,
but in the righthand table 
we use mono(x)=x<sup>-1/2</sup> and F<sub>4</sub>.
</p><p>
Each row of each table states one election. 
The first three columns describe the votes:
The first column states the number of voters approving party A.
Similarly the second column states the number of voters approving
both parties A and B,
while the third column gives the number of voters approving B only.
(We assume "racist" voting, i.e. each voter who approves any A-member,
approves them all;
and that there are an unlimited supply of candidates from each party.)
</p><p>
Column 4 gives the best ordered parliament in chronological order (left to right as time increases)
of election.  Although there may be more than one co-equally-best ordered parliament, we only state one.
</p><p>
Columns 5 and 6 give the seat counts for parties A and B in that parliament.
Finally, the last column states the value of Q (which in the lefthand table
is <i>max</i>imum possible, but in the righthand table is <i>min</i>imum possible, because
we only are considering the <i>best</i> possible parliament).
</p><p>
Gratifyingly, in every case with zero voters approving <i>both</i> parties
(bottom 6 rows of table, colored orange),
as expected, the parliament exhibits perfect PR.
That is, the A:B seat-ratio
in the parliament, is the same as the A:B approval-ratio in the ballots.
</p><a name="cpaidefn"></a><p>
One might like that to be unaffected by the number of "approve both A &amp; B" ballots. I.e,
</p><p>
<b>Possible "cross-party approval independence" (CPAI) property:</b>
Adding all-party-approving ballots to an election 
ought not to affect the seat-count ratios amongst the parties 
(assuming otherwise "racist" party-line voting).
</p><p>
But arguments can be made that CPAI is an <i>un</i>desirable property.
The question is debatable:
<dl>
<dt>Undesirable:</dt>
<dd>
  Imagine a million-voter electorate, all of whose voters approve
all candidates from <i>both</i> parties A and B.  
In that case presumably there would be a 50:50 split of the seats
A:B (either due to symmetry, or just in expectation if ties were broken by coin flips).
Now add to this 3 more voters (now 1000003 in all) with two approving A only,
while one approves B only.  Then CPAI would demand a 2:1 seat split.  It seems
unreasonable that just 3 voters out of a million should so-drastically alter parliament
in this scenario.
</dd>
<dt>Desirable:</dt>
<dd>
MORE??
</dd>
</dl>
Regardless of the outcome of that debate, we
feel intuitively that, at least, we ought to have the weaker
</p><p>
<b>"Cross-party approval diminution" (CPAD) property:</b>
Adding all-party-approving ballots to an election 
either ought not to affect the seat-count ratios amongst the parties 
(assuming otherwise-"racist" party-line voting) <i>or</i>
it ought to <i>diminish</i> ratios that had exceeded 1.
</p><p>
CPAI is achievable. For example <a href="RRV.html">Thiele's method</a>,
also called "reweighted range voting" if scoring-style ballots are used, achieves CPAI.
But at this point is is unknown whether CPAD is achievable <i>in combination</i>
with the "holy grail" properties.
</p><p>
However, evidently, in the lefthand table, the ratios <i>are</i> affected, i.e. CPAI
is violated (although never by more than 1 seat per party in the examples tabulated); 
and more disturbingly, those effects have the "wrong sign" &ndash; adding
"approve A&amp;B" ballots sometimes 
<i>magnifies</i> the seat-count ratio for the stronger versus
the weaker party, whereas one would intuitively desire either no effect (CPAI), 
or a diminution.  Thus the lefthand table also demonstrates CPAD violations.
</p><p>
However, by replacing mono(x)=x by mono(x)=x<sup>-1/2</sup> and 
F<sub>&infin;</sub> by F<sub>4</sub> 
(righthand table)
the number of violations of the CPAI property is diminished;
indeed we get perfect CPAI PR except for two elections 
in which we have CPAI to within &plusmn;1 seat errors in both cases,
<i>and</i> the discrepancies from CPAI all have the "correct sign" i.e.
obey CPAD.  But bizarrely,
the symmetric A=1, A&amp;B=10, B=1 election then prefers to elect 7 A's and 5 B's
(or the reverse &ndash; 7 B's and 5 A's &ndash; these two parliaments are co-equally optimal) 
breaking the symmetry.
This suggests the resulting system still violates CPAD, even though, technically, there
are no CPAD violations in the righthand table above.
</p><p>
Strangely enough, in every election shown, <i>either</i> the
righthand or lefthand election method delivered perfect CPAI PR, but sometimes not both.
</p><p>
Now for a further investigation. In the table below,
the same two sets of voters elect parliaments with 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 seats,
each time using F<sub>&infin;</sub>, &Delta;=&frac12;, and mono(x)=x.
(Also note, in every case, if the "A&amp;B-approve" bipartisan voters were removed,
then we'd have perfect PR, i.e. exactly the same votes ratios as seats ratios.
Those are not shown; just trust me about that.)

The CPAD property evidently is violated in all 
non-orange elections tabulated, but the violation is only by
1 seat extra except in the bottom line of
the table (30-member parliament; colored aqua) where the violation is by 2 seats:
(8,22) versus (10,20).  Also, the rightmost column of the table shows what would
happen to the seat-counts if we changed the election method to use 
F<sub>4</sub>, &Delta;=&frac12;, and mono(x)=x<sup>-1/2</sup>.  Note
that CPAD still would be violated.
</p><p>
<b>Note re runtime:</b>
For elections of the above kind featuing K parties
and completely-partisan voting,
it is trivially possible to maximize Q and find the "best" parliament
in only order K<sup>W</sup>V steps rather than W!V.
It is an <b>open question</b> whether such a speedup is
possible for entirely-general elections.

Now let us redo something much like our original 12-member parliament, 2 parties study,

<h3> A failed holy grail scheme (but useful to think about) </h3>
<p>
Here is a straightforward 
attempt to generalize MSPAV to create a holy grail voting system 
whose quality function Q is evaluable in polynomial
time.   As we'll see, this attempt fails &ndash; but the explanation of why and how it fails
will be useful mental preparation for the next section.
</p><p>
<b>Algorithm</b> for computing a quality function Q for a parliament &alpha;
using a weighted set of <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style ballots &beta;:
<ol><li>
Initialize Q&larr;0.
</li><li>
While &alpha;&ne;&emptyset; do
<ol><li>
Let S be the cardinality of &alpha;.
</li><li>
Let U be the summed weight of all of the ballots in &beta;
that approve at least one member of &alpha;.
</li><li>
Let X be the current approval winner within &alpha; 
according to the current weighted ballot set &beta;,
and let A be X's weighted approval in &beta;. 
</li><li>
Update &alpha; by removing X.
</li><li>
Update &beta; by multiplying the weight of each ballot that approved X by a factor of
F=max{1-A<sup>-1</sup>U/(S+&Delta;), &frac12;}.
</li><li>
Q &larr; Q+A;  [or more generally we could consider Q &larr; Q+mono(A);]
</li></ol>
End While.
</li><li>
Output Q and stop.
</li></ol>
<p>
In this algorithm &Delta; is a constant, e.g. &Delta;=&frac12;.
Incidentally, if desired (and if &Delta;&ge;0)
we can agree to <b>pre-normalize</b> the ballot weights
so that they sum to 2W<sup>-1</sup>(W+&Delta;)/(1+W+2&Delta;)
where W is the number of seats being elected, i.e. the
cardinality of the input parliament &alpha;.
This normalization ensures (a priori) that the final value of Q will obey 0&le;Q&le;1,
with Q=1 happening only if every ballot approves every candidate in &alpha;.
</p><blockquote>
Derivation of that normalization:
Let Z be the sum of the ballot-weights.
If all ballots approve all candidates
then the deweighting factor F is
<nobr>F[S]=1-1/[S+&Delta;]</nobr> 
if <nobr>S+&Delta;&ge;2</nobr>, which in turn is assured if <nobr>&Delta;&ge;0.</nobr>
Here we have written F[S] to make it explicit that F
depends on the number S of seats remaining to be filled.
These F[S] are used for S starting at W (the number of seats in parliament)
and going down to 2.  Then
<center>
Q = Z + Z F[W] + Z F[W] F[W-1] + ... + Z F[W] F[W-1] ... F[3] F[2].
</center>
Now sum the series to find
<center>
Q = Z+Z&sum;<sub>2&le;k&le;W</sub>&prod;<sub>k&le;S&le;W</sub>(1-1/[S+&Delta;])
  = Z+Z(W-1)(&Delta;+W/2)/(&Delta;+W).
</center>
Hence to cause Q=1 we need 
<nobr>Z=(&Delta;+W)/(&Delta;+W+[W-1][&Delta;+W/2])</nobr>
which simplifies to 
<nobr>Z=(2/W)(W+&Delta;)/(1+W+2&Delta;)</nobr>
valid if &Delta;&ge;0.
</blockquote><p>
This quality function obviously is computed in
O(W<sup>2</sup>V) steps if there are V&gt;1 voters and W&ge;1 winners.
This is polynomial time.
</p><p>
And the election method consisting of electing the W-winner parliament that maximizes Q
indeed will obey some of the Holy Grail desiderata:
</p><ol><li>
Strong PR.  
Because:
It should be obvious from the <i>multiplicative</i> nature of the reweighting that if it obeys
basic PR, then it must also obey strong PR.
To see it obeys basic PR, suppose not.  I.e. suppose a Q-maximizing parliament &alpha; 
in a "racist voting" scenario was disproportional.
The <i>last</i> MP "elected," i.e. the last X removed from &alpha; by the above algorithm, then
will necessarily be from
the most under-represented <i>available</i> color.  
But at that final moment there is only one candidate still
available, and he necessarily is the most over-represented  color, which is why he still <i>is</i>
available.
Now replace that X by a member of the <i>genuinely</i> most-under-represented color
(who, we postulate, would be available in the full pool of candidates, but
is not available
in the parliament &alpha; presented to us as a fait accoompli).
Obviously, that would "greedily" increase Q.
This increase contradicts the assumption Q was maximized by the present parliament &alpha;,
thus proving basic PR holds in the sense that no 
over- or under-represented color can exist in a maximum-Q parliament (provided enough candidates
of each color had run).
</li><li>
Monotonicity.
If the approval for some member X of parliament is increased (all else staying the same), 
that will increase that parliament's
Q-score, while leaving the Q of X-omitting parliaments unaltered.
Because:
The "unaltered" part is obvious.
The "increase" part's proof is similar to our previous holy grail algorithm, by induction on parliament cardinality.
</li></ol><p>
Unfortunately, this quality function Q <b>fails</b> to yield a holy grail voting method,
because it is <i>discontinuous.</i>
Consider E&gt;1 parliamentarians whose weighted approvals are exactly <i>tied</i>.
Now consider breaking the tie by, e.g. infinitesimally reducing the approval for one while infinitesimally
increasing it for another.  In that case, the value of Q will, in general, <i>jump</i> discontinuously
versus if the tie had been infinitesimally broken in a different manner.
</p>

<h3> 
Second holy grail scheme: MSPAV with infinite-cloning transform
</h3>
<p>
THIS SECTION NOT YET FINISHED??
</p><p>
Our approach to create a (genuine) holy grail scheme 
will be to use the failed scheme above, but try
to convert its quality function Q to become continuous without
sacrificing either its desirable properties or its
polynomial-time algorithmic efficiency.  
There is an interesting and fairly general looking
transformation we can employ for that purpose.
</p><p>
<b>M-fold cloning transformation.</b>
"Clone" each member of parliament M times (getting a new parliament with MW seats instead of W).
(All clones receive the exact same approvals on ballots.)    
Call the resulting quality function Q<sub>M</sub>.
</p><p>
Now consider the
<b>M&rarr;&infin; limit</b>
of some <b>post-processed</b> version of Q<sub>M</sub>, such as 
(Q<sub>M</sub>)<sup>1/M</sup>
or
Q<sub>M</sub>/M.
</p><p>
The hope is that (i) some such "clone+post-process+limit" transformation converts a discontinuous Q
into a continuous one, and (ii) while still preserving the polynomial-time computational
complexity of our Q.  Obviously, in general these hopes are not necessarily going to be satisfied, 
and a certain amount of creative art is needed to make (i) and (ii) happen &ndash;
but it often seems plausible that such an attack will work.
</p><p>
To explain why this could hope to yield a continuous Q even though the original untransformed Q is discontinuous:
Suppose there are two candidates with the first having
a lot more approval then the second.
The chronological election order behaves like
1111122222
and if the second's approval increases then maybe
1121212122,
and if it increases further then maybe
2212121211,
and after still further increase maybe
2222211111.
Here we have shown M-fold cloning with multiplicity factor M=5.
So in this way, if M&rarr;&infin;
we could hope to get a continuous quality function, where we do not just discontinuously
jump from a 12 to a 21 election situation, but rather pass through an infinity of intermediate states.
</p><p>
But then what if there is a <i>three</i>-way near tie among candidates 1, 2, and 3?
We then realize the behavior could get quite messy...
</p><p>
Now let us discuss how we are going to apply this whole idea to
the specific "failed" Q above.  Our examination will start out <b>abstract</b> but 
we shall make it more specific toward the end by working out the particular formulas we need.
</p><p>
It is more useful to view everything <i>not</i> as M-fold cloning with M&rarr;&infin;, but
rather as continuum-divisible candidates using continuum time.
</p><p>
That is, an election might proceed as follows.
Candidate 1 is the most approved.   We elect 0.37 of him, causing,
via "fractional deweighting" of his ballots, his approval to drop to
become exactly equal to candidate 2's.
Now we fractionally-elect both candidate 1 and 2 at relative "election rates"
of 0.53 and 0.32 (causing their deweightings to remain exactly equal
to each other as time goes by), and keep doing that for just the right
amount of time
to cause both their approvals to become exactly equal to candidate 3's.
Now we fractionally-elect both 1, 2, and 3 at relative rates... until
candidate 1 drops out of the picture since he has now been fully elected,
now only 2 &amp; 3 continue on being fractionally elected.  Etc.
</p><p>
This then is a continuum-time election process with a finite number
of possible "states."  Transitions between the states occur whenever
two candidates' approval levels become equal (approval levels change continuously
with time)
or whenever a candidate becomes 100%-elected (his election-fraction also
changes continuously with time).
</p><p>
Each time such a state-transition occurs we need to solve some set
of simultaneous equations to determine the new "election rates" for whichever
candidates are then involved,
and then solve some other equations to determine how long to proceed until the
next state-transition occurs.
</p><p>
WRONGNESS NEEDS TO BE FIXED??:
The total algorithmic runtime should then be <nobr>polynomial(C)VT</nobr>
where C is the number of candidates, V&gt;1  is the number of voters, and
T is the number of transitions between states,
<i>provided</i> those simultaneous equations can be solved in polynomial(C) steps
each transition??
</p><p>
The number T of possible algorithm-states is 
at most 2<sup>W</sup> where W is the number of winners,
since this counts the number of possible subsets of the W members of parliament.
But note that if a candidate gets incorporated into the current state, then
he necessarily stays in it until he becomes fully elected, whereupon he leaves it,
never to return.
This "once in, once out"
behavior means that the possible state-transitions are not
arbitrary and there 
cannot be anywhere near as many as 
2<sup>W</sup> when W is large.
</p><p>
How many states can arise?
The answer is the solution of this combinatorial problem.   Get out your pencil and draw
W different horizontal line segments like this:
</p><pre>
    *------------*
           *--------------*
       *-------*
</pre><p>
(here shown with W=3 representing the time-intervals when each of the W members of
parliament is involved in the algorithm's "state"). 
Then ask: what is the maximum possible number of different
"states" (i.e. different intersections of these W line segments with a
rightward-moving vertical scanline representing "time") that
can occur in any such drawing?
If the answer is called T(W), then we find
</p><center>
T(0)=1,
T(1)=3 (if the "before" and "after" states are counted separately),
T(2)=5,
T(3)=7, ...
etc
</center><p>
and T(W+1)=2+T(W) because each new line-segment (at worst) splits the states occuring at 
each of its two endpoints.
Hence T(W)=2W+1.
</p><p>
This is indeed much slower-growing than 2<sup>W</sup> and
ensures the whole algorithm will run in a number of steps bounded by a polynomial.
</p><p>
Excellent.
</p><p>
Now to make this efficient, we need the simultaneous equations to be <i>linear</i> equations
(efficiently solvable via Gaussian elimination);
or if they somehow are
solvable via linear programming (or semidefinite or convex programming)
that also would
be acceptable, since those also have polynomial-time algorithms.
The point is, we need them to be solvable more efficiently than
general simultaneous nonlinear equations, because for them only
exponential-time algorithms are known.
</p><p>
The other kind of equation &ndash; to determine the timespan until the next
state-transition &ndash;
is trivial because it involves only one variable, so some sort of binary
search procedure (or any other efficient 1-dimensional rootfinding scheme;
see Press et al and note the monotone-decreasing nature of anybody's weighted approval
causes such roots to be unique)
will solve it to high accuracy fast.
</p><p>
All that has been a somewhat abstract proof sketch
telling us whether and when our whole "M-fold cloning in the M&rarr;&infin; limit" idea
can be made to work to yield a polynomial-time algorithm
for evaluating a now-continuous parliament-quality function.
</p><p>
We now shall make this proof more <b>concrete</b> and less abstract
by working out what, exactly, all the equations are for our particular application.
</p><p>
<b>Iterated deweighting.</b>
Let us consider the F<sub>1</sub>, 
F<sub>2</sub>, and F<sub>3</sub>
deweighting 
<a href="#deweightformula">formulas</a>,
all of which, we remind the reader, are the same if h&le;&frac12;,
namely
</p><center>
F = 1-h
&nbsp;&nbsp; where &nbsp;&nbsp; h=A<sup>-1</sup>U/(S+&Delta;),
</center><p>
were A is the weighted approval of the candidate currently being elected, 
U is (with the same ballot weightings) the weighted approval of a
hypothetical universally approved candidate,
S is the number of seats remaining to be filled (just before our candidate is elected),
and &Delta; is a constant such as 1/2.
</p><p>
The <i>effect</i> of deweighting using this F is to replace A by A'  and U by U' 
and finally S by S-1 where
</p><center>
U' = U - U/(S-&Delta;),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A' = A - U/(S-&Delta;).
</center><p>
Letting B=A/U and B'=A'/U', we also find
</p><center>
B' = [1 + 1/(S-&Delta;-1)] B - 1/(S-&Delta;-1).
</center><p>
Now let us iterate this replacement K times, causing the replacements 
U&rarr;U<sup>(K)</sup> and B&rarr;B<sup>(K)</sup>
where for example B<sup>(0)</sup>=B and B<sup>(1)</sup>=B'.
Writing J=S-&Delta; for brevity, the U result is
</p><center>
U<sup>(K)</sup> 
= U &prod;<sub>0&le;r&le;K-1</sub> [1-1/(J-r)]  
= [1 - K/J] U
= [1 - K/(S-&Delta;)] U
</center><p>
because the product telescopes.
The first few B iterates are

Of course, the above derivation assumed h&le;&frac12; and hence
those iteration formulas break down
if h&gt;&frac12;.  But this regime also can be handled.
It is simplest to do so if we are using formula F<sub>1</sub>=max(&frac12;,1-h),
because then the K-fold iterated deweighting factor F is simply 2<sup>-K</sup>.
In this way, the general notion of "iterating the F<sub>1</sub> deweighting formula K times"
can be defined, and efficiently computed, for any real K.
One would need to use an efficient
1-dimensional rootfinder to find the "critical" least K,
call it K<sub>crit</sub>, causing h to rise to &frac12;.
(Again note the monotone-decreasing nature of anybody's weighted approval
causes such roots to be unique.)
If the desired K is greater than K<sub>crit</sub>, then cut the K-fold iteration into two parts: before
and after this transition, and perform them each separately.
</p><p>
The resulting formulas place us in a position to consider <i>fractional</i> iteration, i.e. the notion of
<b>"electing somebody K times"</b> where we now allow K to be a <i>non</i>integer real number.
The effect of that is to replace 
U&rarr;U<sup>(K)</sup> and A&rarr;A<sup>(K)</sup>
and S&rarr;S-K, and each ballot that approved him is deweighted to 
A<sup>(K)</sup>/A times its original weight, while the weight of each ballot that disapproved him 
is unaltered.
</p><p>
[More generally, a theory of "fractional iteration" was devised by Ernst Schr&ouml;der
in 1871 and is discussed at length in the book by Kuczma et al.  However, we do not need
general Schr&ouml;der theory to handle F<sub>1</sub>.]
</p><p>
We also can consider the notion of fractionally-electing a <i>set</i> of E candidates
who all are tied, i.e. all have equal weighted approval.
To do so, we 
&epsilon;<sub>1</sub>-elect candidate 1, then
&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>-elect candidate 2, ... then
&epsilon;<sub>E</sub>-elect candidate E, 
then repeat this cycle, where the
&epsilon;<sub>j</sub> all are positive <i>infinitesimals</i>.
The ratios of the
&epsilon;<sub>j</sub> are the relative "election rates" of these E candidates,
and need to  be chosen in such a way as to cause all their weighted approvals to remain tied
as we proceed.   
That may be accomplished by solving a set of E simultaneous linear equations.
</p><p>
In general, the
&epsilon;<sub>j</sub>
will be unequal, but 
if E=2 then we enjoy equality &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>=&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>;
and in any "no overlap"
situation where no two current candidates are simultaneously approved by any voter,
we also would enjoy equality <nobr>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub>=&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>=...=&epsilon;<sub>E</sub>.</nobr>
</p><p>
Determining the
&epsilon;<sub>j</sub>
may be accomplished via Gaussian elimination in O(E<sup>3</sup>) operations,
plus the time required to write down the system of equations in the first place, which obviously is 
at most O(VW).
Once the
&epsilon;<sub>j</sub> have been found,
performing the process is simply a matter 
of solving a system of first-order ODEs (ordinary differential equations) to
track the time-evolution of the ballot weights for the 
R relevant kinds of ballots.
Here of course R&le;min(2<sup>E</sup>, V)
because there are only V ballots (since V is the number of voters) and
because a ballot could approve any subset of those E candidates, and
there are 2<sup>E</sup> such subsets.
</p><p>
If ODE-system solving is regarded as efficient enough to get enough accuracy,
and we don't worry about very unlikely ultra-near-ties where you would need extreme accuracy,
then
this shows there is an efficient algorithm.
We should really write down the system of equations and the ODe system fairly  explicitly...
LITERATURE: 
I think Ker-I Ko has a book where he shows ODE-solving is a polytime task within
his notion of "polynomial time computable real numbers."  
[Specifically the initial value problem y'=f(x,y) with y(0) specified, is
computable function if f is and if solution unique.  If furthermore f is Lipshitz with
respect to its 2nd argument, then
y is P-space computable but this can be P-space complete.]
Have to look that up.

Bournez, Graca, Pouly 2011 &amp; 2016
and Smith ????.
In our case the "stiffness" of our ODE system is less than E, 
and presumably additive errors &epsilon; with 1/|&epsilon;| bounded
by a polynomial in V and C would be acceptable, which should be achievable
using plain 4th order Runge Kutta as in the Press book...
albeit with fancier high order ODE-solving schemes probably
exponential accuracy would be achievable...
So I think this will prove we indeed have gotten it into polynomial time, with approriate definitions and
caveats...
Albeit... it's a rather horribly messy algorithm...

<h3> Third holy grail scheme: Ebert with optimum approval-removal </h3> 

<p>
Algorithm definition: For a V-voter, C-candidate, W-winner election,
with 1&le;W&lt;C and 6(W+1)W&lt;V, 
this algorithm will compute a cost-function Q of
the ballots and the W-winner parliament.  
The election method then is to elect the W-member
parliament having minimum cost.
</p><blockquote>
<p><b>1. [Input and pre-process votes]</b>
Each voter, as her ballot, <i>approves</i> (1) or <i>disapproves</i> (0) each candidate.
We allow arbitrary positive voter weights;
most simply all voters v have weight &rho;<sub>v</sub>=1.
If <a href="RangeVoting.html">score</a>-style ballots instead were provided,
then convert them to weighted <a href="Approval.html">approval</a>-style ballots
via a preliminary <a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>; 
then let &rho;<sub>v</sub>
denote the weight of voter v's ballot.
</p><p><b>2. ["Approval removal"]</b>
The approval by voter v for candidate c is thus a boolean quantity (1 or 0).
Replace it by X<sub>vc</sub>. Here the X<sub>vc</sub> are VW different
real-valued variables each constrained to lie
within the real interval [0,1] if v approved c, but constrained to equal 0 if v disapproved c.
Their values will be explained/determined later (via the cost-minimization in step 5).
<!--
This can be viewed as each voter v who wants to approve c, actually approving him only with
probability X<sub>vc<sub> &ndash; except that the process is deterministic...
-->
</p><p><b>3. [CFAT]</b>
Apply a "coin-flip approval transform" 
(<a href="NonlinQuality.html#coinflip">CFAT</a>) 
to convert the resulting set of 
weighted partial-strength approvals, to a different such set.
The simplest CFAT is that each voter is split into two voters, each with half-weight: 
the first approves
candidate c (with strength X<sub>vc</sub> as before)
if the original voter did; the second simply disapproves candidate c.
This splitting is repeatedly done for each member c among the W members of parliament, 
so that at the end of the process each voter is split into
2<sup>W</sup> voters, each weighted 2<sup>-W</sup> times
the original voter's weight.   
</p><blockquote>
Fancier kinds of CFAT also are possible involving
"biased coins," where the weights &rho;<sub>a</sub> and &rho;<sub>b</sub>
of the two daughter-voters a,b are no longer equal, but instead are pre-specified positive
multiples of the original weight &rho;<sub>v</sub> of the voter v, with
<nobr>&rho;<sub>v</sub>=&rho;<sub>a</sub>+&rho;<sub>b</sub>.</nobr>
Also possible are certain cleverer kinds of "coins" which replace
the exponentially growing 2<sup>W</sup> with certain quantities bounded by polynomial(W).
See the text for descriptions of how those work and their properties.
</blockquote>
<p><b>4. [Extra fake voters]</b>
Adjoin 3W fake voters, each of whom approves every candidate.
Equivalently but more simply, a single fake voter v weighted &rho;<sub>v</sub>=3W will do,
such that X<sub>vc</sub>=1 for every candidate c.
(It also is possible to omit this step by replacing it with
various other devices.)   
</p><p><b>5. [Compute cost function]</b>
Compute the "<a href="NonlinQuality.html#tcex">Ebert</a> cost function" Q as follows.
Let A<sub>c</sub> denote the sum, over all voters v, of the 
&rho;<sub>v</sub>X<sub>vc</sub>-weighted approval
for candidate c, that is
A<sub>c</sub>=&sum;<sub>voters v</sub>&rho;<sub>v</sub>X<sub>vc</sub>.
Let load(v)=&sum;<sub>winning c</sub>X<sub>vc</sub>/A<sub>c</sub>
be the sum, over all W winning candidates c, of 
X<sub>vc</sub>/A<sub>c</sub>.
Finally define 
Q=min&sum;<sub>voters v</sub>&rho;<sub>v</sub>load(v)<sup>2</sup>,
where the minimization is done over all possible choices of the VW variables
X<sub>vc</sub> subject to the constraints
</p><center>
0&le;X<sub>vc</sub>&le;1 
&nbsp; and &nbsp; 
X<sub>vc</sub>=0 if v disapproved c
&nbsp; and &nbsp; 
&sum;<sub>v</sub>&rho;<sub>v</sub>X<sub>vc</sub> &ge; 3W for each winning c.
</center><p>
<!-- and optionally?? &sum;<sub>c</sub>X<sub>vc</sub>&ge;1.  -->

The text will explain how this minimization problem can
be solved to D-decimal accuracy in polynomial(V',W,D) steps
where V' is the number of distinct voter-types 
<i>after</i> the CFAT transformation in step 3 and fake-voter adjoining in step 4.
It will be seen that the minimum always is unique if (i) it exists and (ii)
not all members of parliament were approved by exactly the same sets of voters.
It will exist <i>if</i> all W members of parliament would have got at least 3W approvals
if there had been no removal &ndash; i.e, because we have written in step 4, always.

<b>Lemmas about concave-&cup; functions:</b>

and f is strictly concave-&cup;
then f(g(x)) is <i>strictly</i> concave-&cup;.
</p><p>
Now by combining lemmas 1-7, noting that the CFAT is a linear transformation, and
doing a little thinking, we obtain the
</p><a name="convexitythm"></a><p>
<b>Concavity Theorem:</b>
Our "sum of squared loads" cost function Q is a concave-&cup; function of the
WV "approval removal" variables X<sub>vc</sub>
in the domain where 
0&le;X<sub>vc</sub>&le;1
and where each  of the W winning candidates gets at least 
3W approvals <i>after</i> all "approval removals," i.e. A<sub>c</sub>&ge;3W
for each winning candidate c.
(Indeed, each squared load is individually concave-&cup;.)
The concavity of Q is strict provided that 
not all members of parliament are approved by exactly the same sets of voters.
</p><p>
Because of the concavity theorem, it is possible to <i>compute</i> the
optimum (i.e. Q-minimizing) choice of the X<sub>vc</sub>'s,
for any specified W-member parliament,
subject to our
linear inequality constraints, to D-decimal (or better)
accuracy via known <b>"convex programming"</b> algorithms such as the 
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid_method">ellipsoid method</a>"
in time bounded by a known polynomial(V',W,D).
Due to the <i>strict</i> concavity, this optimum will automatically be <i>unique</i>.
</p><p>
That allows us to compute our cost function Q in polynomial time, with the <i>proviso</i>
that there might be no solution of the convex programming problem.
For example, if some member c of parliament has less than 3W approvals, 
then there clearly cannot be a solution.
In such a case our algorithm must declare failure.
Indeed, if fewer than W candidates got &ge;3W approvals, then <i>no</i> possible 
W-member parliament would have a computable Q, which would be complete failure.
However, the purpose of putting step 4 in the voting method
was to prevent this problem from ever occuring.
</p><p>
Was our insertion of step 4 legitimate?  Let us explain this in more detail.
If we insist that candidates must be approved by at least 3W voters, even
after all approval-removal, in order to win a seat, then at least one parliament meeting
the conditions for Q-computability will always exist provided
there exist at least W candidates each of whom got at least 3W approvals
with the CFAT, but without doing any removals.
Without step 4, if enough voters hated enough candidates, then it would be possible
for no parliament to exist meeting our conditions.  However, in that case,
at least for elections large enough so that V&ge;6(W+1)W,
it would not matter what we do, because 
the problematic candidates would all have gotten
so few approvals that they do not even "deserve"
half a seat (reckoned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota">Droop quotas</a>) 
so that their election could not violate basic PR in any "racist voting" situation
by more than half a seat per "color."
So we could, for example, simply elect the W most-approved candidates whenever fewer than
W had &ge;3W approvals.  But to treat everything in a simple and unified way we added step 4 to
the algorithm, which adjoins 3W fake voters who each approve everybody. 
If we knew that every candiate got
at least one approval (e.g. from themselves) then we could have step 4 add only 3W-1.
Provided we regard these 3W fake voters as too few to hurt proportionality &ndash; they amount
to less than half a Droop quota if V&gt;6(W+1)W &ndash; problem solved.
</p><p>
<b>Voting system properties.</b>
In the previous papers (specifically part 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html">II</a>) of this series,
we already had examined the "PerEbert" voting system, involving minimizing a "sum of squared loads"
cost function, and proved it yielded both basic and strong PR.   Indeed, we 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#leastsqthm">showed</a> that
in "racist voting" basic PR elections, it became exactly equivalent to
Sainte-Lag&uuml;e party-list.
</p><p>
We 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#coinflip">further</a>
had examined the effect of the CFAT on PerEbert, for
a definition of CFAT involving W "coin tosses,"  each with an arbitrary
single fixed "coin-bias" value.   We proved that the resulting voting system
in "racist voting" basic PR elections, with fair coins was exactly equivalent to
d'Hondt party-list PR; and for general coin bias yielded 
a kind of PR corresponding to Smith's
<a href="NewAppo.html">new</a> "divisor method" of party-list voting
continuously variable between Sainte-Lag&uuml;e and d'Hondt
by choice of the "coin bias" parameter.
</p><p>
We also 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#shiftrecip">had</a>
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#shiftsec">examined</a>
the effect of (what we called) "shifts" or "ghost voters"
upon this PR.  These in the present paper are instantiated by step 4.
We had shown that if the number of ghost voters was smaller than order V/W,
then their effect on proportionality was small.  This is exactly what happens for us
if V&gt;6(W+1)W.
Further, we showed that the effect of
adding order V/W ghost voters perturbed
Sainte-Lag&uuml;e in the "opposite direction" to d'Hondt (approximately &ndash; 
exact equivalence to d'Hondt party list is unattainable in this manner).
Therefore, the PR-altering effect of adding ghost voters in our step 4 will be 
opposite in sign to the effect caused by the CFAT in step 3 and 
indeed by appropriately choosing both the number of ghosts
and coin-bias, these two effects could, if desired, be made
(at least within first order approximation) to cancel each other out 
so that we would still enjoy
Sainte-Lag&uuml;e-like PR.  
Or by manipulating the ghost-voter count and CFAT coin-bias our PR
could be tuned to yield other PR notions.
</p><p>
<b>Monotonicity.</b>
However, paper 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html">II</a>
also 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#nonmonothm">showed</a>
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#ebertnonmono">that</a>
the PerEbert voting method disobeys "monotonicity."
The main innovation here is to realize that the "optimized approval removal"
in our steps 2 and 5 both
<ol type="i"><li>
can be implemented efficiently thanks to our concavity
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/convexitythm">theorem</a>
and known convex programming algorithms, 
</li><li>
restores the following <i>weak</i> form of monotonicity, 
<blockquote>
<b>Weak monotonicity:</b>
Voters by adding
additional approvals of some parliament, 
<i>can never increase</i> its cost function Q.
</blockquote>
</li><li> 
will not wreck the other
holy grail properties.
</li><li> 
Finally, see below about "strong monotonicity."
</li></ol>
</p>
Weak monotonicity obviously holds because if the additional approvals did increase Q, then
we could simply remove them to return to exactly the original Q value.
And whatever the "optimum" (i.e. Q-minimizing) removal is, must do either this well or better
(i.e. must make Q as small, or smaller, than it was originally).
</p><p>
<b>Strong monotonicity:</b>
A stronger and more desirable monotonicity statement would
replace "can never increase" with "always decreases."
</p><p>
This also is true.  The reason is that we've already shown that
the optimum of our convex program is generically
<i>unique</i> and it is 
a continuous and smooth, indeed <i>analytic</i> function of its 
parameters &rho;<sub>v</sub> 
(essentially because of the well known theorem that the roots of a polynomial are
continuous and smooth &ndash; and analytic except on a set of 
lower dimensionality &ndash; functions of its coefficients).  
If our monotonicity were merely weak
then an analytic function would have a "flat spot" &ndash; an open set in the complex plane
throughout which the function assumed a constant value.  But by analytic continuation, this
is impossible unless the function everywhere equals that constant, which in our problem is
plainly untrue.
 </p><p>
<b>Approval-removal does not hurt PR.</b>
Approval removal does not destroy either basic PR or strong PR.
To see this, it suffices to observe that
those PR claims (by their definitions) pertain only to "racist voting"
situations with enough candidates of each "color" available; and in
those situations &ndash; at least if there are no "integer roundoffs" i.e.
each party that deserves 6 seats was getting 6 seats, there were never
any parties which deserved 5.8 and therefore got 6, i.e. we restrict attention
to racist voting elections with 
all voter "loads" equal &ndash;
then minimizing cost can be accomplished without
doing <i>any</i> removals.
In such situations we claim
PR still happens by minimizing the Ebert "sum of squared load" cost function,
even if optimal approval removal is also happening.
Why?  Our concavity 
<a href="https://rangevoting.org/convexitythm">theorem</a>
shows the optimum removal is unique in all no-roundoff
racist situations with &ge;2 colors.
So if "no removal" is optimum, then it is the <i>unique</i> optimum.
</p><p>
Specifically, in any situation where the voter loads all are equal, then an equivalent
form of the Ebert cost function (namely: variance among the voter loads;
minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing Ebert if the number of
voters and number of seats both are fixed, as 
was demonstrated in paper II's
"Ebert &amp; Variance" 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#ebertvarremark">remark</a>)
is minimized since it is zero.
In "basic PR" racist voting situations, 
that happens provided
that Sainte-Lag&uuml;e manages to attain "perfect PR" with no "leftovers" i.e. no
roundoffs to integers needed.
</p><p>
This also happens in "perfect strong PR" racist voting situations with
"commonly-rated candidates" adjoined, since the commonly rated
candidates do not affect the perfect situation that the load variance
is 0.
The result of these thoughts is the
</p><p>
<b>Theorem (Approval removal does not affect "perfect PR"):</b>
Approval removal does not destroy
"perfect basic PR"
and does not destroy "perfect strong PR."
</p><p>
However, we still need to prove the <b>stronger theorem</b>
which also allows imperfect PR
(i.e. including nontrivial integer roundoffs).  We now do so.
For simplicity,
let us first examine the case of <i>two</i> "colors" (e.g. political parties)
in "basic PR" situations.  
<!--
The reader should be able to see 
that our arguments are easy to 
generalize to any number&ge;2 of of parties 
and also allowing "commonly rated candidates."
-->
We are going to consider four cost function variants 
Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>, Q<sub>4</sub>.
</p><p>
Assume racist voter behavior since we are examining "basic PR."
Let the first party have X voters and win S seats; the second
has Y voters and wins T seats.
</p><p>
The Ebert cost function is
<p><center>
   Q<sub>1</sub> =  S<sup>2</sup>/X + T<sup>2</sup>/Y.
</center><p>
If that cost is minimized subject to S+T=fixed we find via the method of
Lagrange multipliers that
S/Y=T/Y, i.e. perfect proportionality.   Presumably in the imperfect
case where we require S and T be integer the answer would be the same as
the optimum real-number S and T, except one would round one of them up and the other down.
If we let X' and Y' denote the reduced values of X and Y got by doing
approval-removals (if any) then the cost function instead is
<p><center>
    Q<sub>2</sub> = S<sup>2</sup>/X' + T<sup>2</sup>/Y'
</center><p>
if all removals are "all or none" i.e. each voter either removes all or
none of her approvals.
This Q<sub>2</sub> formula also is valid if all removals are fractional and equal
(for example if each approving voter removes a fraction 0.37 of each
of her approvals,
where 0.37 is any value that does not depend on the voter except is allowed
to depend on her party).  Note Q<sub>2</sub>&ge;Q<sub>1</sub> 
and indeed Q<sub>2</sub>&gt;Q<sub>1</sub>
if 0&le;X'&lt;X or 0&le;Y'&lt;Y or both, regardless of S and T.
Therefore, approval-removal does not help, i.e. cannot reduce cost,
 in "perfect PR" or "imperfect PR" 2-party situations with either all-or-none,
or equidistributed-within-each-party-fractional, removals.
</p><p>
If we do CFAT (using "fair coins"; with other coin-biases the 
shifts "1/2" in the cost formulas below would
change to other constants) without any approval removal
then by the analysis <a href="NonlinQuality.html#coinflip">given</a>
previously in paper II,
the cost function becomes
<p><center>
    Q<sub>3</sub> = (S+1/2)<sup>2</sup>/X + (T+1/2)<sup>2</sup>/Y
</center><p>
Finally if we do <i>both</i> CFAT and approval removal the cost function becomes
<p><center>
    Q<sub>4</sub> = (S+1/2)<sup>2</sup>/X' + (T+1/2)<sup>2</sup>/Y'
</center><p>
assuming either all-or-none,
or equidistributed-within-each-party-fractional, removals
happening prior to CFAT.
</p><p>
Again, Q<sub>4</sub>&ge;Q<sub>3</sub> and indeed Q<sub>4</sub>&gt;Q<sub>3</sub>
if 0&le;X'&lt;X or 0&le;Y'&lt;Y or both, regardless of S and T.
Therefore, approval-removal does not help, i.e. cannot reduce cost,
in either "perfect PR" or "imperfect PR" 2-party situations with all-or-none,
or equidistributed-within-each-party-fractional, removals.
</p><p>
Now we claim as a <b>lemma</b>
that the optimum way to remove approvals in racist-voting
situations is, in fact, equidistributed-within-each-party-fractional.
Why?  Basically because of 
the previously shown
concave-&cup; nature of the Ebert cost function in approval-variable space:
If you are minimizing any strictly-concave-&cup; function of N variables within
some real interval (same interval for every variable, and function
invariant under permuting the variables) then it is a
fairly well known theorem that this minimum necessarily
</p><ol type="i"><li>
is unique and
</li><li>
occurs when all the variables have equal value.
</li></ol><p>
That theorem is an immediate corollary of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensen's inequality</a>.
So that has proven 
</p><p>
<b>Theorem (interacting CFAT &amp; approval-removal):</b>
<i>Interacting</i> CFAT and approval removal, cannot
destroy basic PR in either perfect-PR or imperfect-PR (rounded) scenarios.
</p><p>
We proved this for only 2 parties, but
actually our whole argument works with any number (not necessarily 2)
of parties &ndash; it generalizes trivially.  (With large numbers of
parties it becomes
far less clear what the optimum rounding to integer seat counts is,
but that doesn't matter, since the proof argument does not need to
know what it is!)
</p><p>
Now finally, we can <b>extend the theorem</b> to also allow "strong PR,"
essentially because commonly-rated candidates cannot alter the minimality of the variance
in the equivalent variance-based 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#ebertvarremark">formulation</a>
of the Ebert cost function,
and since the 
<a href="NonlinQuality.html#pt">Kotze-Pereira transform</a>
is known not to hurt either basic or strong PR.
</p><p>
<b>About convex programming.</b>
Which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">convex programming</a>
algorithm will give us the best possible performance, 
meaning the least runtime and/or
the least memory consumption?
To learn about this, a good start is the review paper by Bubeck 2015
and the earlier ones by Bland, Goldfarb, and Todd 1981 and
Goldfarb &amp; Todd 1982.
(And the book by Gr&ouml;tschel, Lovasz, and Schrivjer remains a classic, albeit somewhat dated.)
</p><p>
<b>Definition of "convex programming."</b>
Given a concave-&cup; real-valued Lipshitz function F(x),
where x is an N-dimensional real vector,
and a convex subset S of N-dimensional space, the "convex programming problem"
is to find the minimum of F(x) among all x&in;S.
A convex programming algorithm will be said to be "polynomial time"
if it provably always succeeds in finding that minimum to D-decimal accuracy,
in a number of steps upperbounded by a known polynomial(N,D,L),
where L is the input length in bits, and
each "step" may involve an evaluation of F(x), its gradient &nabla;F(x),
a D-decimal-accuracy arithmetic operation, or consultation of an "S-membership oracle"
which either reports that a provided vector x indeed lies inside S, or
returns a hyperplane separating x from S.
</p><p>
The historically first (or at least, first to achieve wide recognition)
polynomial algorithm for convex programming in N dimensions was the
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid_method">ellipsoid algorithm</a></b>.  
This algorithm maintains an N-dimensional
ellipsoid known to
enclose the minimizing point x.
In our application, our dimensionality N obeys N&le;VW,
and since all our X<sub>vc</sub>  lie within the real interval [0,1],
we could begin with the sphere centered at (&frac12;,&frac12;,,...,&frac12;) 
with radius (N/2)<sup>1/2</sup>.
Each "major step," the ellipsoid algorithm evaluates &nabla;F(x) at the ellipsoid's center,
or consults the S-membership oracle, or both.  Either way, it finds a hyperplane H
which separates the present ellipsoid centerpoint from the desired minimizing x.
We then use H to cut the current ellipsoid in half. The undesired "wrong" hemiellipsoid
is discarded.  The "right" hemiellipsoid is then replaced by the smallest
ellipsoid surrounding it (which can be computed via a certain known formula
involving a constant number of N&times;N matrix-vector multiplications; preferably implemented
with numerically better behaved "matrix-factorization update" techniques as discussed by
Goldfarb &amp; Todd 1982)
and we continue on.  Each such step provably decreases the N-dimensional volume of the
ellipsoid by multiplication by a 
<nobr>factor&le;exp(-[2N]<sup>-1</sup>)&lt;1.</nobr>
This factor assures convergence to D-decimal accuracy in polynomial time.
Specifically, in our application the number of major steps required is O([L+D]N)
where L is the length of the input in bits.
Since an N&times;N matrix-vector multiplication requires order N<sup>2</sup>
arithmetic operations, the <b>total runtime</b> would be at least of order N<sup>3</sup>D
arithmetic operations, where for our election application N&asymp;V'W.
</p><p>
For smooth cost functions (which ours is), 
the linear dependence on D can be reduced to ultimately-logarithmic by switching to 
a quadratically convergent iteration such as the N-dimensional Newton
iteration &ndash; or quasiNewton or conjugate-gradient methods &ndash; once
the ellipsoid method gets near enough to the answer to assure that
these methods will converge.
</p><p>
Although this is polynomially bounded, unfortunately for us it is a horrifyingly large polynomial.
Furthermore, the <b>memory space</b> needed just to <i>describe</i> an N-dimensional ellipsoid
(or N-dimensional simplex; another version of the ellipsoid algorithm employs enclosing simplices
rather than ellipsoids)
would be order N<sup>2</sup>
numbers, which in our application means order (V'W)<sup>2</sup> numbers.
Keep in mind that in real world applications it would be common for 
10<sup>4</sup>&le;V&le;10<sup>9</sup>.
</p><p>
The two most horrifying aspects of this are the quadratic dependence of the <i>memory</i> usage
on the number V' of (pseudo)voters, and also the cubic or worse
dependence of the <i>runtime</i> on V'.   (And actually, the runtime can be quite a bit worse if 
multiprecision arithmetic is needed due to possibly poor numerical behavior of at least
some variants of the ellipsoid algorithm when
one tries to employ single precision arithmetic.)
</p><p>
<b>(Usually) saving the day.</b>
We now want to point out some features of our particular convex programs which ought to allow,
in almost all elections, reducing the memory-space needs to O(V'+W<sup>2&kappa;</sup>) numbers
and the runtime to
O(V'W<sup>3&kappa;-1</sup>) arithmetic operations.
These improved bounds often should be quite acceptable, since both their dependencies
on V' are merely <i>linear</i>, and since the number W of winners in
real-world elections tends to be small,
anyhow much smaller than V.
</p><p>
The idea is as follows.  Randomly
divvy up the V' pseudovoters into about V'/W<sup>&kappa;</sup>
disjoint sets, each consisting of
about W<sup>&kappa;</sup> voters.
(The constant &kappa; can be chosen empirically to get the best performance,
from among, say, 1&le;&kappa;&le;3.)
For each such set in succession, use convex programming to optimize its own
X<sub>vc</sub> variables (leaving all the X<sub>vc</sub> for v in other sets, fixed).
Each such optimization runs in polynomial(W) arithmetics and memory.
Call the entire set of all V'/W<sup>&kappa;</sup>
of these reduced-dimension optimizations, an
"iteration."   <i>If</i> each iteration reduces the location-error
for the minimizing x, by a constant factor (or better), then O(D) iterations
will suffice to reach D-decimal accuracy.   We believe that most elections
with high probability (given the randomized voter partitionings)
will behave that way.  If so, excellent.  If
not, then more iterations will be needed, but we still will 
safely decrease Q each iteration and this process is guaranteed to converge to the minimum
&ndash; that convergence will just take more iterations than we'd hoped.
Probably even better than fully optimizing for each voter-subset, would be
to do just one major step of the ellipoid method within a
voter-subset, then switch to a different voter-subset and continue on.
</p><p>
We also remark that other ideas in Bubeck 2015 may allow further speedups.  
There are many
algorithm variants one could try, 
and which perform best is largely an experimental question.
For example, the "conjugate gradient" and
"Nesterov accelerated gradient descent"
(NAGD) general purpose optimization methods
plausibly will work well, the latter because it is plausible that for
most elections our cost function is "strongly concave" with small "condition number."
</p><p>
Minimization methods like BFGS quasi-Newton and the ellipsoid method have the
advantage that they can "understand" general quadratic and general concave-&cup;
functions, but the disadvantage that this understanding requires a
model containing order N<sup>2</sup> numbers in N dimensions, and work
growing quadratically or worse with N.
Meanwhile although first-order methods like crude gradient-descent cannot understand 
general such functions, they work well for minimizing functions
whose "condition number" is small, e.g. which are approximately spherically symmetric
about their minima.  For them a step takes only O(N) time and memory.
This led to the question: what was the best possible
performance, as a function of the condition number &kappa;&gt;1, for a first-order method,
requiring storing only O(N) numbers?  This question ultimately was answered by 
Yurii E. Nesterov and
Arkadi Nemirovsky in the 1980s, who showed that the naive gradient descent requirement of order
&kappa; iterations to halve the error, was improvable to order &radic;&kappa;
but not further.  
See  Bubeck, Lee, Singh 2015,
Allen-Zhu &amp; Orecchia 2015, and
Kim &amp; Fessler 2015
for recent papers about methods related to NAGD
which achieve optimum performance-dependence on the condition number
for a first-order minimization method.
<!--
Nesterov's original paper was in Russian but is reviewed in English inside
Beck &amp; Teboulle 2009.
-->
</p><p>
For us, the important &ndash; albeit nonrigorous &ndash; realization is that 
the runtime and memory dependence
on V' can be reduced to <i>linear</i> while keeping the dependence on W polynomial.
This claim in fact could be made <i>rigorous</i> provided we <i>forbid</i>
elections featuring condition number &kappa; depending too strongly on  the number V of voters.
For example if &kappa;=V<sup>o(1)</sup> then
we could prove runtime growing like V<sup>1+o(1)</sup>.
</p><p>
<b>About the CFAT and "slimmed" versions thereof.</b>
The <a href="NonlinQuality.html#coinflip">CFAT</a>
splits each voter into 2<sup>W</sup> different voters,
by "tossing W coins" in all possible ways.
This exponential blowup is acceptable if V&ge;2<sup>W</sup>
because in that case the number of voters will still be of order V
after merging voters having the same approval "type" (i.e. who approve the same set of
winning candidates) by summing their weights &rho;<sub>v</sub>.
And indeed, in most real-world large government elections 
this  V&ge;2<sup>W</sup>
condition has historically been satisfied.
For example, in Australia, each state elects 12
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate">senators</a> to
the federal parliament via a PR-STV multiwinner
voting method, but only W=6 at a time (staggered terms)
with typically about V=4&times;10<sup>6</sup> voters per state.
In Canada, there are single-winner elections in ridings.  As far as we've been able
to <a href="CanadaSeatsVotes.html">tell</a>, 
the record largest number of candidates that ever ran in a riding was 13, and
each riding contains up to about 10<sup>5</sup> registered voters.  So even if
Canada switches to a PR system involving multiwinner elections, it
seems likely that it will have W&le;13 and V&ge;10<sup>5</sup>.
</p><p>
However, we claim it is possible to replace our CFAT by "slimmed" variants
featuring only polynomial blowup.
We actually know many ways to do that, but the slimmest among them is as follows.   
Consider only the W winners.
There are exactly W+1 subsets S of these winners with &ge;W-1 members each.
For each such S, replace each voter by one who approves the <i>intersection</i> of whoever
she originally approved, with S.
In this way each voter is replaced by W+1 new voters, <i>not</i> 2<sup>W</sup>.
These new voters shall have two weights. Namely, one of the W+1 new voters
is idential to the original voter, except will have a reduced weight; and the other W
each shall have the second weight.
</p><p>
??
</p><p>
<b>What is the purpose of the CFAT?</b>
It may seem as though the CFAT step 3 could simply be omitted from our voting method,
while still enjoying Holy Grail properties.
However, we would then suffer disagreeable behavior on the following class of 
(W=2)-winner elections
with V=2(1+x)N voters and 4 candidates named A,B,C,D:
</p><table bgcolor="aqua">
<tr bgcolor="yellow"><th>#voters</th><th>Candidates they approve</th></tr>
<tr><td>xN</td><td>A,B,C</td></tr>
<tr><td>xN</td><td>A,B,D</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>D</td></tr>
</table><p>
If x&gt;0 is small, then the winners are {C,D}.
But when x&rarr;&infin; we would like {A,B} to win.
Without the CFAT, unfortunately {C,D} would remain the unique winning parliament 
regardless of the value of x&ge;0, and the possibility of removing approvals for A and/or B
cannot avoid this.
</p><p>
But with CFAT, it turns out that {A,B} wins when x&gt;3 while {C,D} wins when 0&le;x&lt;3.

Their 8th order Runge-Kutta method is one of the best for serial machines in tests.

Looks like his 10-12 method is good in tests.

Our application is not very stiff, time-scale ratio E at most. 
We seem suited to Bulirsch Stoer using palindromicity.

second derivative (A)/(p+q*x) with respect to x = 2*A*q^2 / (p+q*x)^3
if p+q*x>0 always concave-U.

second derivative (B*x)/(p+q*x) with respect to x = -2*B*p*q / (p+q*x)^3  
(note numerator has no x in it!)
now if p+q*x>0, we need p*q<0.

linear combination of both kinds of terms: safely concave-U  provided A*q>B*|p|.
What normally would happen is |p|>>q and |A|>>B.
In fact normally q=B=1, while A=p=order #voters.
Squaring will help?

product of both kinds of terms:
   A*B*x / (p+q*x)^2   whose 2nd deriv is   2*A*B*q*(q*x-2*p) / (p+q*x)^4
     x^2 / (p+q*x)^2   whose 2nd deriv is   2*p*(p-2*q*x) / (p+q*x)^4

second derivative f(x)^2 with respect to x = 2*f*f'' + 2*f'^2.
For us, f=load>0.   Sum of loads = 1.   Load sum is nonstrictly concave-U.

second derivative f(x)*g(x) with respect to x
g f'' + 2 f' g' + f g''.

second derivative of (x/(K+x))^2 + (K/(K+x))^2 with respect to x
4*K*(2*K-x) / (K+x)^4
concave-U if 2K>x>0

second derivative of (x/(K+x))^2 + (1/C)*(C*K/(K+x))^2 with respect to x
imagining 0<C<<1
2*K*(3*C*K+K-2*x) / (K+x)^4
concave-U if K>2x>0   regardless of the value of C>0

this is not working out for me.  The Q function is not necessarily concave-U.

TOBY PERIEIRA 1 Nov 2016:
 think PAMSAC can produce "wrong" results because it only has weak monotonicity.
E.g. Approval voting, 2 to elect:

1 voter: AB
1 voter: AC

PAMSAC elects AB (or AC) over BC because of its approval removal. 
To elect AB, it effectively changes the ballots to:

1 voter: B
1 voter: A

AB then beats BC in a tie-break because it has more total approvals. It doesn't beat
it by its overall score (based on squared loads), making it a fragile victory.
But with this example:

100 voters: AB
100 voters: AC
1 voter: B
1 voter: C

Approval removal can't save AB (or AC), and so BC is elected. Candidate A is approved 
by 200 out of 202 voters but still fails to be elected, so this is definitely 
 shortcoming for PAMSAC. This example seems pretty obvious actually. I should have
come up with it before! It doesn't make PAMSAC an awful system though, because
all other systems that I'm aware of also produce "wrong" results. But it
does show that more work needs to be done.

WDS:
am I confused?... Since I think the "First holy grail scheme: MSPAV with best ordering"
mentioned in our horribly still unfinished
  /HolyGrailPR.html
indeed would elect AB (or AC) in the above example.

TP: PAMSAC also appears to fail independence of irrelevant ballots - at least
in a weak sense. Irrelevant ballots are ballots that approve all or none
of the candidates in question. If A and B are parties fielding many
candidates each, we could have the following ballots:

2 voters: A
10 voters: AB
1 voter: B

A method passing this criterion would elect twice as many A as B candidates
(the 10 AB voters are ignored). But according to my calculations, PAMSAC
would be indifferent between anything from a 12:1 A:B ratio to a 2:11 ratio!
I say it weakly fails because the "correct" result is within its range.

But if we had these ballots:

2 voters: A
10 voters: AB
0 voters: B

it would conclusively elect all A candidates. Which is a good thing.

WDS:Is there anything wrong with simply eliminating all
the irrelevant ballots (which approve all or none) before
we begin?
--well, to answer my own question, if the approval ballots arose
from a Kotze-Pereira transform.. then any score-style ballot
all of whose scores were positive and distinct, is going to cause a positive
weight for an all-approve ballot.  If we artificially eliminated those
all-approve ballots, that'd be like distorting the original score-style ballot
in a way that looks pretty unacceptable.

WDS:
Also in this example
2 voters: A
10 voters: AB
0 voters: B
MSPAV with best ordering too would conclusively elect all A candidates.

Finally in TP's example
2 voters: A
10 voters: AB
1 voter: B
where you'd like a method that elects twice as many A as B candidates
(ignoring the 10 AB voters), I think that is indeed going to happen, or
close to it, with this method?  Er, maybe not.  Somehwre between 1:1 and 2:1 A:B
ratio, I think is going to happen.

Toby Pereira:
 But a more general definition for multi-winner participation (that works for
 approval or score but makes less sense for ranked voting) is that by casting
 an honest vote, a voter can never cause the number of elected candidates
 that they have approved (or the total score they have given to the elected
 candidates) to go down. It could be possible for a method to pass the
 definition you've linked to but fail the one I've given. I'm pretty sure psi
 voting would pass it anyway, and PAMSAC might.
