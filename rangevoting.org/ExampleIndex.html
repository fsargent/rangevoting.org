<H2> Index of Interesting Examples of Election Pathologies on the CRV website </H2>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="AddTopFail.html">"Add top" failure in BTR-IRV &amp; Rouse voting methods</a>;
adding votes ranking X top causes X to lose, this is one example of a general theorem that
in <i>every</I> Condorcet voting method, add-top or add-bottom
(or both) failure election-scenarios exist.
(But range voting never exhibits add-top or add-bottom failure.)
</li><li>
Simplest example of a <a href="CondAppConflict.html">conflict</a> between 
Approval and Condorcet winners, used as preface to general theorem that no such conflict 
exists under 
certain assumptions about voter behavior;
</li><li>
Simple <a href="CondRangeExample.html">example</a> of situation where
honest range voters elect somebody who is not the (traditionally defined) Condorcet winner
(but range always elects a Condorcet winner according to a <i>non</i>traditional definition);
an argument that the nontraditional definition is a better idea is the
&quot;<a href="rangeVcond.html#slaves">free the slaves</a>&quot; example;
</li><li>
<a href="FishburnAntiC.html">Fishburn example</a> of a pure-rank-order-ballot
election where (a) a unique Condorcet winner exists, (b) most people would agree it is
the "wrong" winner.
<a href="CondCoursera.html">Condorcet self-contradiction</a> example.
<a href="PuzzSaariT.html">Related example</a> where every weighted-positional voting system
agrees that B wins but every Condorcet voting system says A wins.
</li><li>
<a href="PuzzCC.html">Poison pills</a> are a common parliamentary trick that depend
on the creation and exploitation of Condorcet cycles.
</li><li>
<a href="IncentToExagg.html">Favorite Betrayal</a> works to elect the "lesser evil"; 
this is a general purpose example that works for
almost every ranked-ballot method
ever seriously proposed including all Condorcet methods
(and <a href="AlteredExagg.html">this</a>
is what you get after the betrayal);
illustrates "spoiler" effect which is what leads to 2-party domination;
(But range voting never exhibits favorite betrayal); also in this example, if
C is deleted, then A wins instead of B, illustrating the fact that 
ex post facto deletion of "irrelevant losers" can alter election results in 
almost every ranked-ballot system ever seriously proposed (but that never happens in range voting);
</li><li>
IRV example where 
<a href="IrvHurtFav.html">voting maximally for somebody makes him lose</a> but voting maximally
against him makes him win;
(can never happen with range voting)
Another such <a href="ClayIrv2.html">IRV example</a>.
</li><li>
IRV example where 
<a href="IRV1519.html">IRV refuses to elect Condorcet winner</a> (and 
demonstrates "IRV spoiler pathology")
</li><li>
IRV example where 
<a href="CoreSupp.html">IRV refuses to elect Condorcet winner even though has more top-rank votes than the IRV winner</a> 
</li><li>
"Top-3-only" bastardized IRV &ndash; <a href="IRV3.html">plenty of things</a>
can go wrong with that that
go beyond the things that can go wrong with ordinary IRV.
</li><li>
IRV <a href="Monotone.html">non-monotonicity</a>.
</li><li>
<a href="IRVcs.html">Simple IRV spoiler example</a>.
</li><li>
IRV <a href="IrvNonAdd.html">non-additivity</a> example (why IRV cannot be counted in precincts).
</li><li>
Condorcet <a href="CondNonAdd.html">non-additivity</a> example (somewhat analogous)
</li><li>
IRV <a href="IRVamp.html">&quot;amplification&quot;</a>
phenomenon that can lead to "chaos";
related 
<a href="IRVunger.html">Unger examples</a>
where IRV elects somebody who would lose pairwise by large margins to every opponent but one 
(whom beats by only 1 vote), and this IRV winner is the same candidate as the IRV "worst"
candidate, i.e. who would win using IRV on all-reversed-votes.
</li><li>
Voting honestly in IRV can 
<a href="IRVpartic.html">be worse for you than not voting at all</a>
(but in range voting, that can never happen);
also illustrates "favorite betrayal" and "spoiler" and "lesser evil" pathologies in IRV;
</li><li>
<a href="ClayIrv3.html">Another structure</a> of IRV favorite-betrayal examples
</li><li>
IRV <a href="IrvRevFail.html">winner=loser</a> pathology (reversal failure;
winner=loser
can never happen with range voting, Borda, Schulze beatpaths, Tideman ranked pairs, Approval
unless all tied);
also illustrates a no-show paradox (honest votes hurt you) and bizarre lying
techniques (maximally dishonest total-lie vote is better for you than an honest one);
(with range voting, honest votes never can hurt you versus not voting at all)
</li><li>
Simple
<a href="Peru06.html#anal">explanations</a> 
of how the Peru 2006 pathology could have
happened under IRV (also same thing happened in
<a href="FunnyElections.html#ch70">Chile 1970</a>);
</li><li>
The <a href="FrenchStudy.html">French study</a> gives an example from real life where
the approval-voting election winner had below 50% approval.
</li><li>
<a href="PuzzKjqAns2.html">6 different winners in 6 different voting systems</a>;
</li><li>
In many voting systems best strategy for a cofeeling voter subset is 
<a href="PuzzFAVS.html">not</a> for them all to vote in the same way (but with range voting, 
all-vote-same <i>is</i>
best strategy for a co-feeling group);
</li><li>
All of the simplest <a href="PuzzMGaAns4.html">nonmonotonic IRV elections</a>
(in contrast, range voting is monotonic);
</li><li>
<a href="PuzzQkfAns6.html">Nontransitive dice</a>
</li><li>
Borda <a href="rangeVborda.html#clones">"cloning helps"</a> example
(in contrast, cloning never helps or hurts in range voting);
</li><li>
Borda example by Johnson
where <a href="rangeVborda.html#JohnsonEx">ex post facto deletion of
an "irrelevant loser" leads to
complete reversal of all other election results</a>
(in contrast, this kind of deletion of somebody never affects the range voting winner or
results order unless
the deletee <i>was</i> the winner);
</li><li>
Simple example of range vs IRV (done both ways) election
where, under IRV, <a href="rangeVirv.html#SimpleEx">voting honestly for X makes X lose</a>
</li><li>
IRV <a href="rangeVirv.html#nasty">elects D but an approximately 2:1 supermajority 
prefers C over both D and  everybody else too</a>;
also <a href="WVmore.html#Ketchum">Dave Ketchum</a> gives a similar example;
</li><li>
Same theme taken to an extreme:
In <a href="PuzzlePage.html#prob18.html">Puzzle 18</a>,
IRV refuses to elect
a candidate preferred by 99:1  or larger supermajorities over every other candidate
(and ranked top or second-top by every voter);
</li><li>
IRV example by Brams showing <a href="rangeVirv.html#BramsEx">numerous pathologies</a> including
how "truncating" your vote can be better than an honest IRV vote, and how raising
your vote for B from bottom to top can cause B to lose;
</li><li>
Several examples involving randomness or incomplete information
in which best range voting strategy is
<a href="RVstrat1.html">not "Approval style"</a> (although under certain 
approximate <i>assumptions</i>,
an approval-style range vote, or something extremely close to it, always is strategically best)
</li><li>
Several 4-candidate examples involving randomness or incomplete information
in which best range voting strategy is
<a href="RVstrat2.html">dishonest</a> (but with &le;3 candidates
best range vote always is at least "semi-honest" and refuses to reverse an
A&gt;B relation among two candidates);
</li><li>
Thomas Smith illustrates a 
<a href="SmittyExp.html">classic debate between Borda &amp; Condorcet</a>
and shows how range voting resolves the debate using intensity information unavailable to Borda
and Condorcet;
</li><li>
Adam Tarr's 
<a href="TarrIrv.html">realistic example</a> where favorite betrayal (to elect the "lesser evil")
is best voter strategy in IRV
(causing "spoiler" effect, leading to 2-party domination);
</li><li>
Kevin Venzke <a href="VenzkeFBC3.html">proves</a> that 
<a href="WinningVotes.html">winning votes</a> 
Condorcet with "candidate-equalities permitted in votes" <i>still</i>
exhibits "favorite betrayal" (aka. "spoiler effect," "lesser-evil")
of the sort that engenders Duverger law 2-party domination (but favorite betrayal never
happens with range voting);
<a href="VenzSimp.html">simpler example</a> by Warren Smith of the same thing;
</li><li>
Venzke's <a href="VenzkePf.html">brilliantly simple proof</a>
that "favorite betrayal" is sometimes "strategically forced" in <i>every</i>
Condorcet voting method (whether rank-equalities are allowed or not).
</li><li>
The <a href="rangeVborda.html#DH3ex">DH3 pathology</a>
(also described in more detail
<a href="DH3.html">here</a> and especially
<a href="WinningVotes.html#DH3">here<a>)
which is an enormously severe and common pathology afflicting Borda and Condorcet voting systems
and caused by strategic voting (but plurality, IRV, range, and approval are immune to it);
</li><li>
<a href="WinningVotes.html#Laatu">Example by Juho Laatu<a> where 
&quot;<a href="WinningVotes.html">winning votes<a>&quot; Condorcet
looks pretty stupid compared to "margins";
</li><li>
But 
&quot;<a href="WinningVotes.html">winning votes<a>&quot; Condorcet
looks good versus "margins" in this example where it avoids "favorite betrayal"
but margins does not;
</li><li>
<a href="FunnyElections.html#port86">Portugal 1986</a>
probable real world example of J.H.Nagel's &quot;<a href="BurrSummary.html">Burr dilemma</a>&quot;
pathology of approval voting showing that for strategic reasons "vote splitting"
still is possible with Approval (but range voting should diminish this effect);
</li><li>
World's largest <a href="FunnyElections.html">dataset</a>
of real world presidential-level "wrong way elections";
</li><li>
<a href="PuzzlePage.html#p31">Puzzle 31</a>
shows how removing a single candidate can cause the
election results (in any weighted positional voting systems, 
such as Borda and Plurality) to <i>reverse</i>.
</li><li>
Maximal disagreement between Borda and Approval is
demonstrated in <a href="PuzzlePage.html#p30">Puzzle 30</a>.
</li>
</ul>
