<h2>A Response to Richard Anderson-Connolly</h2>

In response to <a href="http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/oped/?p=4175&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1#more4175#more4175" 
title="this comment,">this comment,</a> by <a href="http://www.ups.edu/" title="UPS">UPS</a> sociology professor <a 
href="http://www2.ups.edu/faculty/raconnolly/" title="Richard Anderson-Connolly">Richard Anderson-Connolly</a><br/> 
<br/> Richard,<br/> <br/> It's ironic that you begin by calling other, non-IRV, voting methods "complex", especially 
since one of the biggest advantages of Range Voting over IRV is its simplicity. In Australia, for instance, voting is 
<i>compulsory</i>, and a rank ordering of <i>all</i> the candidates is required on each ballot. That is significantly 
more work for voters than using Range Voting, where they could just score the few candidates they know or care enough 
about, and ignore the rest. With Range Voting, this isn't particularly harmful.<br/> <br/>Consider a few 
places where Range Voting is used on a massive scale: <a href="http://youtube.com/t/help_general#general10#general10" 
title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://hotornot.com/" title="Hot-or-Not">Hot-or-Not</a>, <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=13316081#rate#rate" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. 
Range Voting doesn't seem to have been too complicated for the millions of visitors those sites draw. Millions of 
customers at Amazon.com seem to have no problem scoring the books they've read with a quick click of the mouse. Olympic 
judges seem to have no problem using Range Voting for gymnastics, ice skating, snow boarding, etc. I don't think 
they'd want to use IRV however.<br/> <br/> When it comes to the actual administration of the elections (ballot layout, processing, and mathematical aspects of 
tabulation), Range Voting <i>dominates</i> IRV. You just calculate the average score for each candidate. With IRV, the 
process isn't rocket science, but it's definitely more complex. You have to successively remove the candidate with the least 
number of votes, and then reassess, until a candidate has a "majority" (although that's a misleading term, since it 
doesn't necessarily imply a Condorcet majority). See <a 
href="Complexity.html">this page</a> for a more thorough look at the respective complexity 
of Range Voting versus IRV.<br/><br/>Regarding Condorcet methods, what is your 
basis for claiming that "Condorcet voting is probably the most preferred by experts"? Consider that with Range Voting, 
if voters are strategic (willing to selfishly vote insincerely, to get a better result, from their perspective) the end 
result is <a href="AppCW.html">the same</a> as we'd get from <i>honest</i> Condorcet 
voting.
Let me repeat in layman's terms: the <i>worst</i> result that Range Voting can achieve, due to selfish strategizing, is 
the same as the <i>best</i>, 100% honest, result that we would expect from Condorcet! But if voters are strategic 
using Condorcet, the results are the stuff of <span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">nightmares</span>. Consider the <a 
href="DH3.html">DH3 pathology</a>, in which strategy under Condorcet yields the candidate 
universally seen to be the <i>worst</i>. It is not a stretch to say that Range Voting is, under reasonably strategic 
voting, a better Condorcet method than <i>real Condorcet methods</i>. But the real argument ender is the fact that 
Range Voting produces <b>substantially</b> lower <a href="BayRegExec.html">Bayesian regret</a> 
than Condorcet methods. Here's a complete <a href="CondorcetExec.html">head-to-head 
analysis</a> between Range Voting and Condorcet methods. Simply put, if these unnamed "experts" say that 
Condorcet methods are better than Range Voting, they're wrong, in every reasonable objective way we can evaluate that 
contention.<br/> <br/> Next, you claim that you are more "practical about the issue" than a "character" like me. What 
do 
you consider to be practical about endorsing an <a 
href="HonestRunoff.html#OakFin">expensive</a>, 
complex alternative to our current voting system, which 
Bayesian regret calculations show can actually bring about <b>lower voter satisfaction</b> (under realistically 
strategic electorates) than even <i>plurality?</i> Do you find it practical for the government to spend a lot more 
taxpayer dollars to implement a system that is, at the very best, only a <i>very modest</i> improvement over our 
current system? Do you think it is practical to implement a system that will not work on many voting machines, when 
Range Voting can be used on any machine that can do plurality elections? Does IRV's near-century of producing two-party 
domination in every country where it has been used not impress you? Does the fact that it has been used, and then later 
abandoned, in around two dozen U.S. cities not impress you?<br/><br/>Your faith that IRV will be a large incremental 
step 
forward, that may well lead to continued improvement in the future, simply does not fit with the evidence. If anything, 
IRV's failure to deliver on its promises, especially for alternative parties, will leave voters disenfranchised, 
bitter, and weary of similar election reform in the future. It's like trying to convert U.S. road signs to metric, by 
first converting to from miles to feet.<br/> <br/>
Your mention of <a href="ArrowThm.html">Arrow's theorem</a> is irrelevant to a discussion of 
Range Voting. Range Voting passes all of Arrow's criteria, but Arrow's definition 
of a "voting method" excludes it. The lesson here is that Arrow used a silly definition of "voting system". Arrow's 
theorem is commonly misunderstood, misquoted, and misused. For more information, check out the Center for Range 
Voting's <a href="ArrowThm.html">page on Arrow's 
theorem</a></p>
It is also wrong to say that supporting a switch to IRV would be no 
more suicidal to third parties than sticking with plurality (while supporting Range Voting). If all the effort and 
money they expended, in order to get IRV implemented, could have gotten <i>Range Voting</i> implemented&mdash;in which case they'd 
actually have a chance of winning elections&mdash;then their work would have indeed been suicidal. And if IRV is 
implemented, people are going to be much less willing to go through the laborious process of implementing and learning 
to use a new system all over again. So in a decade, when those people have seen the failure of IRV (which history says they 
will), and they've decided that they need something better (i.e. Range Voting), 
it will be like the little boy who cried "wolf". Voters won't be very receptive to their message. They'll say, 
"Yeah, we heard this line about getting a better voting method before..and you're <span 
style="FONT-STYLE:italic">still</span> not happy? Tough luck. We're not going through that ordeal again."<br/> <br/> 
When you contend that the major two parties hate IRV, I'd like you to call up some politicians in the major two parties 
of current IRV countries (which are all two-party dominated in their IRV-elected posts), and ask them how much they 
hate having a system that prevents third parties from competing with them,<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic"> </span>or 
even being able to <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">throw</span> the election for them, like Nader did to Gore in 2000, 
under plurality. The only reason that the current dominant two parties in <i>America</i> might dislike a switch to IRV, 
is that it is a change, period. Once we were using IRV, they would certainly dislike a change <i>back</i> to plurality more than they disliked the initial change 
from plurality to IRV.<br/> <br/> You claim that the only problem in San Francisco's IRV elections was a "slight 
delay". But in 2004, the use of IRV there resulted in <a href="SPRates.html#sf" 
title="seven times more spoiled ballots">seven times more spoiled ballots</a>. I didn't bring up any spoiled ballot 
figures for Burlington, but if you're responding to the Vermont page I linked to, perhaps you could cite our specific 
claims, as well as verifiable contradictory figures. The <a href="index.html" title="Center for Range 
Voting">Center for Range Voting</a> aims to be as honest an accurate as possible, and we would very much like to <a 
href="HowToImprove.html" title="correct any errors">correct any errors</a> you may have found. 
That's more than you can say for IRV organizations, like the Center for Voting and Democracy (the chief proponents of 
IRV), who routinely publish <a href="Irvtalk.html" title="IRV Lies and Myths">egregious errors</a>. 
And while we're on the topic of Burlington, Vermont, I should point out that it is frequently cited as an example of a 
city in which, in the first year of IRV's use there, a third party candidate, Bob Kiss of the Progressive Party, won 
the mayoral race. What IRV advocates usually leave out is that Kiss got 39% of the first place votes, and would have won under plurality 
voting anyway. Some would say that IRV took away the fear of voting for a third party candidate, and that without that 
effect, Kiss wouldn't have won. But let's also not forget that this was IRV's <i>first 
year</i> of use in Burlington. Had the conservative voters of Burlington used IRV for more elections by that point, 
they would have known to strategically vote for the "centrist" of the race, who would have then beaten Kiss, giving those 
conservatives the "<a href="FBCsurvey.html" title="lesser of two evils">lesser of two 
evils</a>". Lastly, let's also bear in mind that Burlington is <a 
href="http://www.cjnetworks.com/%7Ecubsfan/places/burlington.html" title="demographically atypical">demographically 
atypical</a>, and this scenario is reminiscent of the 2003 mayoral election in San Francisco, which was between a 
Democrat and a Green. In a more demographically typical race, with voters who have been using IRV for a few years and 
<i>know</i> how to be strategic with it, we can basically say that a third party 
candidate would need to get more than 50% of the first-place votes in order to win.<br/> <br/> Finally, your statement 
about IRV's virtually always picking a "majority" winner (which I can only take to mean "Condorcet" winner) is simply 
baffling. You state:<br/> <blockquote><i>The only time IRV doesn't produce a majority is 
when sufficient people don't rank enough preferences and the race goes into multiple counting rounds.</i></blockquote> It's not clear whether you're saying that you think this just happens to have been the case throughout 
Australia's history, or that it's true as a general rule. The former is unlikely, and would warrant substantial evidence. The latter is 
patently false. Consider the following generic scenario, where we have three hypothetical candidates representing 
the left, middle, and right (Left and Right are interchangeable arbitrarily named ideological extrema).<br/>
<br/>
<table cellpadding="2" style="background-color: #FAF9E1; text-align: center">
	<tr style="background-color: #A6C8FF">
		<th>% of Voters</th>
		<th>How They Voted</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>49%</td>
		<td>Left &gt; Middle &gt; Right</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>25%</td>
		<td>Middle &gt; Right &gt; Left</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>26%</td>
		<td>Right &gt; Middle &gt; Left</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br/>
This situation produces a paradox, in that the Condorcet winner (Middle) is preferred to the IRV winner 
(Right) by <b>74%</b> of the voters. This type of scenario is quite 
realistic; it has happened <a href="FunnyElections.html" title="several times">several times</a> 
that we <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">know</span> of (e.g. Chile 1970, Per&uacute; 2006). If this hasn't happened in 
the entire history of Australia (which you haven't cited evidence to prove), that would simply mean that no third party 
candidate has ever become popular enough that the "opposite" party had an incentive to vote for the middle candidate. 
It wouldn't negate the point about IRV's "center squeeze" effect however.<br/> <br/> As I hope you and others will see, 
the science of voting methods is quite a complex subject. It is a veritable branch of mathematics unto itself. Society 
does not benefit from sort of overly optimistic pronouncements, or the hand waving in the face of dissenting evidence, 
that you demonstrate in your adherence to IRV. If we support IRV, despite the mountains of evidence that tell us 
exactly what kind of failure we can expect from it, then we're going to pay the price. We're going to get what society always gets when it disregards hard 
science in favor of easy gut reactions. We all owe it to ourselves to face discomforting realities when the situation 
calls for it, and to change course accordingly. We're talking here about the very mechanism by which society 
collectively works to make decisions. If that is broken, then human civilization is broken. This isn't a "political" 
issue. This is about whether children in a far away country wake up to the sound of our bombs. This is about the fate 
of our species. If any of that particularly matters to you, then I encourage you to put all your spare 
time and effort into supporting Range Voting, <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">not</span> IRV.<br/> <br/> Regards,<br/>
