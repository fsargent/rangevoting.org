<H2> An appealing delusion about Condorcet voting methods </H2>
<H3> The A>B>C "full support" myth </H3>

<p>
<a href="OssipoffEnd.html">Mike Ossipoff</a> once stated:
</p>

<p>
I advocate Range over
Condorcet, as a <i>public proposal.</i>
Assigning points from 1 to 10 is already familiar to people...
</p>

<p>
<i>But</i> if it's a question of which I'd prefer if I could enact whatever
single-winner reform I wanted, I'd choose Ranked-Pairs(wv) or
the wv version of BeatpathWinner/CSSD.  
[<small>Editor's note: these are two
Condorcet methods that Ossipoff particularly likes.  Later, in 2007, Ossipoff
said he preferred SSD for public elections and CSSD for organizations and committees with 
few voters.  Both CSSD and SSD
are the same as <a href="SchulzeExplan.html">Schulze's beatpath method</a> except for how
they handle tie-breaking.</small>]
</p>

<p>
Why would I choose Condorcet if the enactment decision were
entirely up to me?  <i>Because, with Condorcet(wv), the voter who feels
that it's necessary to fully support Gore against Bush will still be fully 
helping Nader beat Gore.</i>
(End quote.)
</p>

<p> 
In contrast, Ossipoff feels that in range voting, you can fully support
Nader versus Gore, or fully support Gore versus Bush, but not both at the same time.
</p>

<H3> Our Reply busting this myth </h3>
<p>
That was an appealing point by Ossipoff, although
in fact, I suspect Ossipoff is wrong.
I am not precisely sure what "fully supporting A versus B" means to him,
but anyhow, it is a known theorem of Moulin &amp; Perez that 
by casting a vote saying A>everybody,
your vote can <i>cause</i> A to lose,
or by casting a vote saying everybody>B, you can prevent B from being the bottom-loser
(or, usually, both kinds of paradox are achievable)
and this is true in every  Condorcet
method.
</p>

<p>
I do not see how you, by (say) casting the vote Nader>Gore>Bush, causing
Nader to lose when he otherwise would have won, would be "fully supporting"
Nader!  (Incidentally, in range voting, this paradox never arises:
your vote A>everybody can never cause A's defeat, and your vote saying everybody>B can 
never cause B to rise above bottom.) 
So I think Ossipoff's appealing point here, is actually an appealing
<i>delusion.</I>
</p>

<p>
Disagree? 
Then consider the following "voting method": 
<ol type="a">
<li>you supply rank-order ballots,
</li><li>
I ignore them and choose whomever I want to be the winner.  
</li></ol>
As far as I can tell,
you, by disagreeing, presumably feel that this method
also has the property that a voter can "fully support A>B and B>C at the same time"??
</p><p>
In my view, it shouldn't be  about some <i>bogus perception</i> of
"full support."  It should be about <i>real</i> support, which means, helping A win
or at least not causing A's loss.
If your vote containing A>X doesn't help A win (and in fact causes A to lose)
then it was not "fully supporting" A in my book, sorry.  With that definition:
no Condorcet method 
always allows a voter to fully support A>B and B>C 
at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Still disagree?  It seems to me if your goal is to "fully support A versus B"
then, in either Condorcet or IRV voting, you should vote <i>A>others>B</i>.
This should give you a strictly greater chance of electing A and not B, than any other
vote (if, e.g, the other voters act randomly).  
[For example, consider <a href="IncentToExagg.html">this Condorcet election</a>
in which an A>C>B vote elects A but C>A>B fails to do so and 
elects B.  Also you can see <a href="CondStratProb.html">this discussion</a>
for how a vote X>Y>Z can elect X while X>Z>Y elects Z.]  
Similarly if your goal is to "fully support B versus C"
you should vote <i>B>others>C</i>.
And, obviously, you can't do both at the same time.

<h3> Gibbard-Satterthwaite </h3>
<p>
Indeed, no rank-order voting method <i>whatever</i>
(whether rank-equalities are allowed in votes, or not),
always allows voters to fully support A>B and B>C
at the same time &ndash; in the sense that
there always exists a 3-candidate election situation
in which casting the honest vote A>B>C causes a worse election result
(from that voter's point of view) than casting some other (hence dishonest)
vote would have caused.
That fact (for deterministic voting systems that are not "dictatorships")
is the famous
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>.
