<H2> Reducing the "dumpster diver attack" problem with Split Receipts </H2>

<p><small>By Clay Shentrup &amp; Warren D. Smith</small></p>

<p>
From Rivest's (1 Oct 2006) paper:
</p>
<blockquote>
 Voters should be cautioned not to casually discard
 or give away their receipts. (The adversary would be
 happy to take for free via "dumpster diving" what he
 might otherwise pay for.)
</blockquote>

<p>
The receipt could come on <i>two</i> sheets of paper.
(Or one, with a very easy way to tear it into two.)
It could  have half the ballot number on half,
other half on other half.
Then if anybody discards them,
the fraudster and dumpster diver do
not know which
ballot numbers it really is
(unless can paste the right
halves to the matching other-halves),
and if several receipts went in that dumpster
they may have to guess, and guessing is a risky
and dangerous thing to do.  (Especially since agents provacateurs
might just be planting "discarded" ballot halves in the right
dumpsters.)
</p>
<p>
This simple fix seems to reduce the severity of and worry about
the dumpster diver attack.
