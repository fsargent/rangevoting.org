<H2>  Randomness in Rivest 3ballot scheme?  Bad idea </H2>

<p>
Some people have suggested, that in Rivests's 3ballot scheme, it would be better if
the voting <i>machine</i> were to choose the 3 ballots <i>randomly</i>,
(as opposed to the voter choosing them) and then the machine were
to spit out a copy one of them for the voter to take home (as usual).
There are two variants here: either <b>1</b>
the voter chooses which of the three
to copy and get, or <b>2</b>
the machine makes that choice also at random.
</p>

<p>
<b>The point</b> of these suggestions was supposed to be that
the voter has an annoying job filling in 3 ballots (or in BOFFO, five ballots)
instead of just one.  This way the machine saves that voter the labor.
The machine just asks the voter for his <i>one</i> (actual-summed) ballot
and creates three that have the desired suma nd meet all the
constraints.  Saving labor.
</p>

<p>
<b>But</b> this is a very bad idea.   Aside from the fact such a machine would
probably have to be computerized (bad!) and we'd have to <i>trust</i> its "randomness"
really was random, there are more severe problems.
</p>

<p>
Variant 
<b>2</b>,
of the scheme is simply vulnerable to vote-buying and coercing.
E.g, the coercer says to the voter: "if you show me a receipt saying 'voted for Clinton'
then I will  pay you a dollar."  The voter then has a 2/3 chance of getting
the dollar if she voted for Clinton, and only a 1/3 chance if not.
In other words, this "harmless"
addition of randomness <i>broke</i> the security properties
of the 3ballot scheme.
</p>

<p>
Variant 
<b>1</b>,
of the scheme is also vulnerable to vote-buying and coercing
if it is used with plurality voting.
E.g, suppose the vote-buyer supports Clinton and  Nader  but is opposed to Bush.
Buyer tells voter: 
"if you show me a receipt saying 'voted for Clinton and Nader'
then I will  pay you a dollar."  The voter then has a 2/3 chance of being able
to get
the dollar if she voted for Clinton, and only a 1/3 chance if not.
