<H2> <a href="http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/INDEX.HTM">Voting Matters</a> 
is a biased, pro-STV propaganda organ masquerading 
as a quality academic journal </H2>

I am rather distressed to report this,
but I am afraid, as of Sept. 2006, that this "journal" is
not what it claims to be.  Its editor Brian Wichmann struck me as
(and portrayed himself as)
an intelligent and  concerned British voting activist trying to
create an unbiased quality academic journal under the auspices of the
biased pro-STV voting reform group ERS (Britain's <i>E</i>lectoral <i>R</i>eform <i>S</i>ociety).
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, that creates a conflict of interest.
What happens if some scientific investigation comes to the conclusion that,
in some way, STV (single transferable vote) methods are <i>not</i>
the greatest thing since sliced bread?  
</p>

<p>
Well, I now am familiar with several instances.  In every instance, <i>Voting Matters</i>
found "reasons" to reject the anti-STV scientific contribution, and to 
accept the pro-STV one.  This includes a case where the pro-STV conclusion 
(by Crispin Allard) was simply
incorrect (his calculation was off by a factor exceeding 100 and that
would have been revealed by even the crudest numerical checks), 
includes a case
of rejecting an attempt (by me) to correct that incorrect calculation 
&ndash; and then,
after that, rejecting even a mere 1-sentence
attempt to <i>point out</i> that I (or, for example, Michael Dummett also in
his book published by Oxford University Press)
<i>claimed</i> the
calculation was wrong (just so that this wrong calculation would not rest unchallenged
in the pages of <i>VM</i> for all eternity) &ndash;
and also includes a case
where the referees and editors forced revisions which vastly distorted the author's
original intent to make his conclusions appear almost 180 degrees away from 
his actual ones (which as a side effect made that author appear to be
almost ludicrously incompetent, which is not at all the reality),
and also includes rejecting, without any refereeing at all &ndash; purely because
the editor proclaimed himself to be "insulted" by it &ndash; my
letter to the editor trying to point out
what was wrong with that paper.  (<i>Legitimate</i> journals bend over backwards
to try to publish such criticisms because they do not want any trace of a stain on
their reputation for integrity...)
I later was able to examine
that author's original submissions and the referee reports he got from <i>VM</i>.
I found that
the latter exhibited <i>massive</i> bias in addition to being utterly
incompetent anyhow.  (They consisted, essentially,
100% of unsupported expressions of opinion
against the author's anti-STV conclusions, facts, and cites to previous literature &ndash;
all of which got 100% obliterated without a trace in the final published version,
which consequently appeared to be about a new scientific finding proving in yet another
new way, the wonderfulness of STV voting.)  I also have further evidence, beyond the above.
</p>
<p>
There are now just too many instances, and the probabilities are just too overwhelming for me.
I am forced to conclude that <i>Voting Matters</i> cannot be regarded as a legitimate journal.
It is a propaganda and misinformation organ,
and everything in it has to be viewed with great suspicion.
