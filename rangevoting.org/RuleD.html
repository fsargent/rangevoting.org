RangeVoting.org - the "safety valve rule" or "quorum rule" D
</title>

<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">


<H2> Why the "quorum rule" &ndash; rule "d"? </H2>

<p>
The purpose of rule "d" is to prevent candidates whom almost nobody has ever heard of,
from being elected by a few radical supporters.
For example, if 99.9% of the voters never heard
of Andreas Q. Snickelgruber and all gave him an "X"
(<a href="Blanks.html">intentional blank</a>) and the remaining 0.1% of
the voters were part of his secret 
world-takeover cabal  and all gave him 99 (maximum possible score) then
Snickelgruber would win!  Horrors!
</p>

<p>
<i>Except</i>: rule "d" prevents that &ndash; saving the world &ndash;
Snickelgruber cannot win unless he gets at least half the score-sum
garnered by the candidate with the greatest score-sum.
(And note, at least <i>one</i>
candidate surpasses this hurdle!)
</p>

<p>
Note: I personally regard the world-takeover plan as 
<a href="Averaging.html#unlikely">ridiculously unlikely</a>
even without rule d.  (Also, if you want to worry about the
"stealth candidate" bogeyman, then
worry about
<a href="Blanks.html#stealthDR">Democratic &amp; Republican</a> stealth candidates
under the current plurality system!)
Anyhow: be not afraid &ndash;
rule d is there to save you from that tiny risk.
</p>

<p>
On the positive side &ndash; the rule d safeguard may have the good benefit of
causing voters who wanted to write X, but without rule d would have been too afraid to do so
and would have voted 0 to "play it safe" &ndash;
now to do so.  That less-fear-based  behavior will have the benefit 
of yielding a more-honest evaluation for Snickelgrubers.
That is good because more voter honesty is good: If Snickelgruber gets
a high score but is not elected (either due to rule d or
because somebody else got a higher score), Snickelgruber's days of anonymity will
be over and now he can aspire to office in a future election.  That is good
because it naturally tends to bring good candidates into the public eye.

Also note:  if all voters score all candidates, i.e. nobody 
uses <a href="Blanks.html">intentional blanks</a>, then
the quorum rule has no effect.

<H3> Write-in candidates </H3>

<p>
One can argue the quorum rule is <i>necessary</i> to make range voting behave sensibly
if we permit <i>write-in candidates</i> who can run for office but whose name is not listed on the ballot.
</p>

<p>
It is rare for write-in candidates to win an election. 
It is less rare than I once 
<a href="JarjuraWriteIn.html">thought</a>  &ndash;
e.g. the longest-serving US senator, segregationist and all-around hypocrite
Strom Thurmond, was originally elected as a write-in; and California congressman 
Ron Packard was also.
(Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. won the 1964 Republican presidential primary as a write-in without
even officially running, thanks to a small group of Republican activists.
Lodge's 35.5% beat B.Goldwater's 22.3%, N.Rockefeller's 21%, and Richard Nixon's 16.8%.)
But still, it is quite rare: as far as I currently know, there were only a handful of
write-in US congress &amp; senate winners out of over 10,000 races conducted.
It is actually probably more common for a write-in 
candidate to get exactly <i>one</i> vote
(presumably their own) than it is for one to win.
</p>

<p>
Without the quorum rule (and with voters who do not mention a write-in candidate on their
ballots being regarded as awarding him "intentional blank" scores), 
range voting could behave very badly by always <i>electing</i> such
unknown one-vote write-ins!  
With the quorum rule, victory by a write-in candidate becomes (just like now) very difficult
(although possible &ndash;
in exceptional circumstances such as <a href="JarjuraWriteIn.html">this</a>, where
it presumably would also have happened under range voting).  
But, fairly, there is no particular bias against write-ins &ndash; if they have quorum-level 
voter response, then they
can get elected.

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff">

Unknown write-in candidates almost impossible to elect.

No such thing as a write-in candidate.
</td>

<tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> 
<td> Condorcet systems (voters allowed to express or not express info about each candidate-pair independently) </td>
<td>
This allows voters to express the information they know but avoid saying what they don't know, similarly
to range's "blank score" option.
But it leads to bad behavior.  
Voters need to express tremendous amount of information in a race with large number N of candidates:
(N-1)N/2 bits of info.  Also very difficult to tell if vote is valid, i.e. does not  contain a logical inconsistency.
Also, it could lead again to surefire election of an unknown write-in candidate (if one exists).
