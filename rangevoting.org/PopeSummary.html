<H2> SUMMARY:  Catholic Popes elected via Approval Voting 1294-1621 </H2>

Renaissance conclaves were hotbeds of intrigue, the outcome of which was rarely predictable.

<p>
This page succinctly summarizes my conclusions about how 
<a href="Approval.html">approval voting</a>
worked in the real world when used to elect 41 Catholic 
<a href="ListOfPopes.html">Popes</a> (actually more, since several "antipopes"
were elected too).
Our conclusions are based on our large 
<a href="PopeElectionStories.html">collection</a>
of all the stories of all these elections;
see also our attempted collection
of the corresponding <a href="ApprovalPopes.html">bare vote data</a>.
You can also read <a href="PopeApprovalSystem.html">this</a>
for a description of the pope election rules and the story of 
</p><ol type="i">
<li> how they came about 
</li><li>
the power of the Pope and his role in history.
</li></ol>
<p>
Finally, there is a <a href="PopeCritique.html">critique / frequently-asked-questions
page</a> about our Pope-conclusions here.
<p>
The Pope at his peak was one of the most, if not the most, powerful person in Europe;
the Papacy remains the single longest-lasting elected position on the face of the Earth;
and the period during which the pope-elections were conducted via approval voting lasted 326
years, substantially longer than the entire history of, e.g, the USA so far.
Because of that and the large number of historians researching Popes, the Popes seem
one of the easiest ways for somebody like me to find out how well approval voting performs
in the real world.
</p>
</p>
<h3> Conclusions </h3>
<p>
<b>1.</b>
 Those pope elections were the most strategic, nasty things
imaginable. Every trick you can think of was tried to game the system,
plus plenty you wouldn't have been smart enough to think of.
</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
 The system used was basically <i>repeated</I> approval-voting elections
(repeated until somebody got over threshold, which was about 2/3,
whereupon the winner won). They had secret ballots, which seems to
have been essential because otherwise, there was not inconsiderable
risk that the new pope would literally have his opponents tortured
and killed. They also had secret everything and the conclave was to
be totally isolated from the world, which was intended to prevent
corruption, etc &ndash; <i>but</i> that latter kind of secrecy usually totally failed &ndash;
which is how I got all this data (there are many books on this
in both English and Italian packed with info about what went on)
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
An oversimplified but still quite-accurate model of what happened was this.
The 3-step strategy (A,B,C) all voters used was:
<ol type="A">
<li>
 Start out cautious by only approving the candidates you considered
really very very good.
A decent fraction of the time, that'd work to produce a pope quickly
who had high approval &ndash; at which point everybody was happy (well,
almost everybody) and game over.
</li><li>
 Then gradually lower your standards for approving somebody,
keeping track of the strategic environment and introducing new
candidates as appropriate. (As do this, try to tell lies about
candidates, threaten, intimidate, bribe, etc etc). Of course,
a faction could try to hold out forever, but that was discouraged by the
fact that as time went on, they'd feed the conclavists less food.
</li><li>
 Eventually, all sides will have lowered their standards enough that
some pope would get over-threshold number of approvals, and then
would win.
</li></ol>
<p>
<b>4.</b>
 So given the oversimplified strategy I just said,
the result was roughly this: if you take everybody's
utility function, the pope-candidate whose minimum utility (among
his friendliest 2/3 of the voters) was greatest, would be elected.
If we were to replace "2/3" with "1/2" in that sentence, this
would have been exactly "maximum median utility" i.e. yielding almost exactly the
same effect, with the ultra-strategic voters they had,
as <a href="MedianRange.html">median-based range voting</a>
with <i>honest</i> voters would
have yielded. 
(But it's actually "maximum 66-percentile utility" not "median.")
</p><p>
And that was a pretty good result!  All in all, it's looking to me like the system
they were using to select popes was actually quite good and did nearly
as well as could be expected under the enormous stresses placed upon it by
the ultra-conniving corrupt and colluding voters that were present.
</p><p>
The <i>repeatedness</i> of the approval voting, combined with the 2/3 supermajority threshold
termination condition,
probably significantly enhanced
its quality.
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
 What if they'd had <a href="RangeVoting.html">range</a> instead of approval voting?
Well, due to the immensity of the strategicness,
I think they'd have all voted in approval-style for all the
perceived favorites, so in that sense it would have made no difference whatever.
</p><p>
However, for <i>non</i>favorites it might have made a difference,
especially in early rounds, and probably for the better since
good candidates would have been brought to the fore, and more quickly.
</p><p>
On the other hand, I think there is good reason to believe (discussed more in the
<a href="PopeCritique.html">critique</a> and 
<a href="PopeElectionStories.html">stories</a> pages)
that
<a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>,
plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>,
or instant runoff voting (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>)
all would have done worse.
