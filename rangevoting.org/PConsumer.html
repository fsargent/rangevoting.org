<blockquote>
There have been 45 presidential elections since 1828.
In at least five, the race went to the
second-most-popular candidate because of a spoiler.
That's an 11 percent rate of catastrophic failure.
Were the plurality vote a car or an airliner, it would be recognized for what it is &ndash;
a defective consumer product, unsafe at any speed.

Actually, if you look at a <a href="FunnyElections.html">larger</a>
(worldwide not merely USA) dataset, then
it appears "11 percent" is an underestimate.
