<blockquote>
There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic
into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting
measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension,
is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; 
John Adams, Letter to Jonathan Jackson, October 1780.
[Adams was a US "founding father," wrote two books on democracy theory/practice,
and served as the second US president 1797-1801.]

<H3> (Or: Why third-parties must enact range voting or die) </H3>

<p>
As everybody, especially  political scientists, has noticed, the USA is immensely
2-party dominated.  
Every presidential election after 1824
has been won 
by a member of one of the two major parties (with the asterisk that 
the parties changed their names a few times during the early 1800s).
In the 2004 presidential election,
the top 2 party's candidates got
50.7% and 48.3% of the votes.  No other candidate got more than
0.38%, with all the others <i>combined</i> getting under 1%.
Holy cow! 
Talk about domination!  
</p>

<a href="TPHist.html">The histories of US third parties</a>
</p>

<p>
And why is that?  Can it really be that this
few Americans support any of those other candidates?  Can it really be that
America really believes with this incredibly great unity that the
Republicans and Democrats represent the absolute summit
of political thought, with nothing else and no other combination of views
possibly being superior?
</P>

<p>
I think not.  This is a completely distorted picture being passed off as a "fair"
and "democratic" system.  It can cause <a href="NewOrleansBudget.html">immense harm</a>.
</p>

<p>
So: why the huge domination?
Because: few people are going to be foolish enough to
"waste their vote" by voting for anybody besides one of the top two.  That causes
3rd parties to get <a href="PsEl04.html">artificially low</a>
vote totals.  That in turn causes them to
get weaker and die &ndash; not to mention 
causing it then to be even <i>more</i> foolish to waste your vote for them next election,
thus 2-party domination is <i>self-reinforcing</i>.
And not only that, under the plurality system voting for a 3rd party candidate
not only "wastes" your vote but in fact makes it more likely
that the <i>opposite</i> of the candidate you want will
be elected from the top 2 parties.  That is a severe disincentive
to vote third party.  Over time all this
leads to self-reinforcing 2-party domination.
</p>

<p> 
It is a lot like having your arm jammed in some machinery.
If you try to run the machinery harder to unjam it, it just jams harder, not
to mention causing you excruciating pain.
</P>

<p>
Political scientists call this 2-party jammed-domination
"Duverger's law" after Maurice Duverger,
a French political scientist.
</p>

<p>
In any voting system in which Duverger's law holds, third parties are
going to be permanent doormats.
And the rest of us consequently are going to suffer from massively reduced voter choice,
massive idea-deficit, and massive quality deficit in
our government.
</p>

<p>
Duverger's law is an experimental fact supported by vast amounts of data
from governments around the world throughout time.  Several political science
books present convincing tables and graphs of such data.  (See "further reading" at the end.)
Duverger holds
both in <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a> systems and in the 
<a href="rangeVirv.html"><b>IRV</b></a> voting system. 
(These are the IRV countries: 
<a href="Ireland2002.html">Ireland</a>,
<a href="AustralianPol.html">Australia</a>,
<a href="MaltaPol.html">Malta</a>,
and
with the recent addition of
<a href="FijiPol.html">Fiji</a>.
All are 2-party dominated in IRV seats,
despite having systems
that would seem more multi-party-genic than the USA would be under IRV.
You can also check this <a href="IRVStratPf.html">mathematical proof</a> or see
this IRV&rArr;2-party-domination <a href="TarrIrv.html">explanation</a>
based on an example from Adam Tarr, or consider the effects of
<a href="NaiveExagSumm.html">naive exaggeration</a> voters.)
Duverger also 
<a href="NESD.html">plausibly</a> might hold in all <a href="rangeVcond.html">Condorcet</a>
systems with strict rank-orderings as votes (click the link and check the
"Strategy and 2-party domination" section to see why; also 
see this <a href="IncentToExagg.html">simple numerical example</a>,
this <a href="Why2Part.html">explanation in a nutshell</a>, and this
<a href="IRVStratPf.html">more general mathematical proof</a>).
</P>

<p>
So third parties
who want to break out of this vicious cycle should <b>not</b> support
plurality, IRV, or Condorcet with rank-orderings as votes.  
They should support <a href="RangeVoting.html">Range</a>
(or perhaps Approval) voting, or the
<a href="HonestRunoff.html">top-2-runoff</a> (second round) system.
But as you can see from <a href="PsEl04.html">tables</a>
of real-world data, Range voting leads to a <a href="https://rangevoting.org/OccWallStudy.html">lot</a>
more pro-third party votes, at least initially, than Approval.  I repeat, a <i>lot</i> more.
That is enough to get third parties off the ground.  It won't be enough by itself
to make them actually win (they will still be well behind the top 2 parties
in terms of money, organization, experience, and present-day voter appeal), 
but it will level the playing field allowing them to
win if they have the best candidate once they
have acquired enough funds and organization &ndash; which
it would then be possible for them gradually
to acquire, since they would no longer be continually
<a href="NurseryEffect.html">stomped-on</a>.
</P>

<p> 
So in summary, the question for 3rd party supporters when they consider
"should we support range voting?" really is
"<b>do you like survival?</b>"  If you think survival is pretty important,
then range voting should be your <i>top</i> priority.  And I mean top.
More important than every single other issue.
</p>

<p>
So <a href="voldir/Volunteer.html">join CRV now</a> because it is <i>the</I>
group pushing for range voting.

my view IRV and plurality <i>both</i> obey Duverger's law.  Note that all the
