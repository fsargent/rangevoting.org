<H2>  Biases in Turnouts </H2>

<p>
In the USA at present (2007) about 5-6 million voters are disenfranchised by state
laws that prevent felons and/or ex-felons
from voting.   Those laws differ in different states. 
</p>
<p>
That can exert undemocratic effects.
For an example (which I am making up), 
suppose 51% of the US public wanted to decriminalize marijauna.
Then, pretty clearly, the democratic thing to do would be to decriminalize it.
But suppose a goodly chunk of those 51% were felons <i>because</i> of marijauna convictions!
Well then, if they
couldn't vote, marijauna would stay criminal, and so on forever.
</p>

<p>
But even in areas where they <i>are</i> 
legally permitted to vote, felons have smaller <i>turnout</i>
than non-felons.  
(Ex-felons currently vote heavily democratic, especially in the South.)
</p>

<p>
The net vote-shift for Bush caused by these
effects (versus what would have happened with 100% voting by all)
was about 3% of the number of votes cast.
</p>

<p>

There are other turnout biases.
</p>

<h3> Household Income &amp; Turnout </h3>
<p>
According to the CNN exit poll in 2004 (USA-wide)
Bush-Kerry splits were 36-63
for under-$15K/year household-income voters and 63-35 the
other way for over-$200K/year voters.
That helped Bush because
income correlates with turnout.
(Based on US Census surveys &amp; CNN exit polls) we find 
in the 2004 election that those with household income&ge;$75K
turned out at an 80% rate (voting 57% for Bush) while
those with income&lt;$50K turned out at a 59% rate (voting 44% for Bush).
The net vote-shift for Bush, caused by this income-based turnout bias
(versus what it would have been with 100% turnout) then, was about 3%.
<small>
Incidentally, the decision to make election day in the USA be
<a href="http://www.whytuesday.org/">Tuesday</a> 
has presumably had the effect of biasing the vote, preventing working-class people from 
voting more than it prevents richer people with more flexible schedules.  Election day is
a weekend or holiday in most other countries.</small>
</p>

<h3> Education Level &amp; Turnout </h3>

<p>
In 2002, 52% of college-degree registered voters
voted versus 27% for those with no college degree.
That also helped Bush versus Kerry since the higher-education voters preferred Bush more
&ndash; <i>except</i> that the voters with
the highest (post-graduate-degree) education levels
actually supported Bush the <i>least</i> of all education-level-groups.
The net effect was probably about a 1% shift for Bush.
</p>

<h3> Age &amp; Turnout </h3>

<p>
The turnout gap was similar for age&ge;30 versus age&lt;30 voters.
That also helped Bush versus Kerry since the older voters both
had higher turnout and preferred Bush more; probably the net shift Bush's way was about 1%.
</p>

<h3> Race &amp; Turnout </h3>

<p>
Blacks and Whites supposedly had fairly close turnout in 2004, but Whites
had higher turnout by about 10% and favored Bush more, with
the net effect favoring Bush again by about 1%.
</p>

<h3> Gender &amp; Turnout </h3>

<p>
Women had higher turnout than men in 2004.  This (for a change) favored Kerry since women
currently vote more Democratic than men.  The net effect was probably 
about a 1% shift Kerry's way.
</p>

<h3> Registration </h3>

<p>
Registration biases, not just turnout biases, have further effects.
</p>

<h3> Rough total </h3>

<p>
The total effect of all these turnout biases in 2004 favored Bush by  roughly
3+3+1+1+1-1=<b>8%</b>, versus what would have happened 
with universal adult suffrage and no turnout biases.
</p><p>
<b>Warning:</b>
adding up the effects in this way is not correct because some 
of the voter-sets overlap.  So this was not quite right.
To fix that would in principle
be simple.  If we had raw data for polls of a random sample of people
about Bush &amp; Kerry, 
then we'd <i>know</i> the true Bush/Kerry support fractions.
The trouble is... who is going to provide this raw, unadjusted data to us?
<p>
<!--
<p>
Here's an estimate from the <i>New York Times</i> 
(29 June 2004, based on NY Times/CBS News poll)
This poll tried to get a random sample of 1053 adult "Americans."
It found Bush's "approval rating" was 42% (no figure given for Kerry).
The same poll restructed to registered voters found 45% supporting Kerry
and 44% for Bush, corresponding fairly well to the later official election results.
</p><p>
There were Gallup and ABC News polls providing figures for all adults, 
in addition to registered/likely voters.
In the Gallup poll [released 8 March 2004;
conducted March 5-7], 
Kerry was ahead of Bush by 5 points among all adults.
In the ABC News poll [March 4-7]
Kerry was ahead of Bush by 11 points among all adults, but
only by 4 points among registered voters with Nader being a poll-choice
(and by 7 without Nader).
</p>
-->
<p>
In a CNN poll (20 April 2004)
registered voters gave the president a 50-to-46 percent 
lead over Kerry in a two-man race. 
And among all adults, Bush led Kerry 49-to-46 percent.

</p><p>
From Robert Moran "A snapshot in time," 4 Feb 2004 <i>National Review</i>:
"CNN/Gallup/USA Today/Democratic National Committee (kidding on that last part... maybe) 
survey of 1,001 American <i>adults</i> January 29-February 1, 2004 showed John Kerry defeating 
Bush 53 to 46 percent.
A Newsweek survey of 1,022 <i>registered voters</i> taken at the same time showed Kerry 
defeating Bush 48 to 46 percent." [My italics.]
</p><p>
The NEP exit poll indicated Republican and Democratic self-identified-party-ID <i>voters</i>
were equal (both 37%) in 2004 while a CBS/NYT poll 
of 885 adults [18-21 November 2004, discussed in NYT 23 Nov] showed
there were 36% Democrat-self-identifying <i>adults</i> versus 29% for Republicans.

</p><p>
These figures <i>do</i> seem to support the hypothesis Bush benefitted from
non-universal turnout, but do <i>not</i> find that benefit to be 
as large as our 8% estimate, they seem to think it is 1-7%.
</p>
<h3> Summary </h3>
<p>
In conclusion, I estimate that the Bush-over-Kerry margin in 2004 would have been
lowered by
<b>(5&plusmn;3)%</b> of the number of total voters
(note the central estimate would easily be enough to make Kerry win)
if the USA had had universal adult voting.

</p>
<!--
Our 8% number is actually an <i>enormous</i> effect, almost as large in magnitude
as the effect of enfranchising Blacks and substantially exceeding the effect
of enfranchising women.
