RangeVoting.org - all Condorcet methods suffer from "favorite betrayal" (proof with no ties)

<H2> A salvage idea that failed &ndash;
Condorcet with 
"candidate-equalities permitted in votes" <i>still</i> exhibits
"favorite betrayal" and hence presumably
leads to 2-party domination. </H2>

<p>
Here is an 11-voter 3-candidate election
example proving that Condorcet schemes with ranking-equalities allowed
suffer from favorite-betrayal, and that is true whether you use "winning-votes"
or "margins" &ndash; doesn't matter &ndash; same example kills both:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="5"  bordercolor="red" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption> C wins </caption>
<tr> 
<th> #voters </th>
<th> their vote </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 2 </td>
<td> A>B>C </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 3 </td>
<td> C>A>B </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 4 </td>
<td> C=B>A </td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="aqua"> 
<td> 2 </td>
<td> A>B>C </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Defeats are A>B by 7:4, B>C by 4:3, and C>A by 7:4. 
There is an A>B>C>A cycle in which B>C is the weakest defeat
(measured by either winning votes or by margins), so that <b>C is elected</b>.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the two A>B>C voters shown in blue on the bottom line
can turn the "lesser evil" B into the Condorcet Winner by "betraying" their
favorite
"third party" candidate A and
voting B>A>C or B>A=C or B>C>A.  
</p>
<p>
However, changing their vote instead to
A=B>C or A>B=C or A=C>B or A>C>B or A>B>C or B=C>A or A=B=C
(or C>B>A or C>A>B or C>A=B)
does not suffice: then C still uniquely wins in all cases.
Hence favorite-betrayal of A was strategically necessary.
</p>
<p>
All this is true <i>regardless</i> of whether you use "margins" or "winning votes."
However I have cheated a bit by assuming the Condorcet method is such that it elects the candidate
with the weakest defeat in a 3-cycle.
