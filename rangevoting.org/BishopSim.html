<H2> Numerical experiments with Apportionment methods </h2>

<p><small>By Dan Bishop with some contributions by Warren D. Smith</small></p>

<p>H.Peyton Young
argued in his book
[M.L. Balinski &amp; H. Peyton Young:
<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/press/books/fair_representation.htm">
Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of One Person, One Vote (2nd edition)</a>,
Brookings Institution Press 2001]
and (more accessibly) in his
<a href="pb88.html">essay here</a> 
that the best apportionment method was Webster's.
</p>
<p>
We now do computer simulations that reach the same conclusion as Young.
The simulations assumed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>  There are 50 states and 435 seats.
</li><li>  
A state with population p 
is given max(m, r(p/q)) seats, where r is the appropriate rounding 
function for that apportionment method, m is the minimum number of seats a state can have
(in our simulations we always take either m=0 or m=1) and q is chosen so that the total 
number of seats comes out to 435.
</li><li>  State population is a uniformly-distributed, or exponentially-distributed
(there were two kinds of simulations)
positive random variable.
</li><li>  Bias is defined in three ways:
<ol>
<li>
Pearson's [centered] correlation coefficient between the 
states' populations and log(seats/population). 
</li><li>
Spearman's [rank-based centered] correlation coefficient between the 
states' populations and their seats/population ratios.  A Spearman bias of +1 
means that a high-population state will always be better-represented 
than a low-population state, and a bias of -1 means vice versa.
</li><li>
Pearson's [centered] correlation coefficient between the 
states' populations and their seats/population ratios.
</li>
</ol>
(Whether Spearman is log-based or ratio-based makes no difference since Spearman is simply
the Pearson correlation of the integer rank vectors and hence is invariant under
monotonic function transformations of either data vector.)
</li><li>  10,000 simulations were performed for each method.
</li><li>  Each bias-measurement datapoint given as mean&plusmn;std.error.
</li>
</ul>
<H3>Definitions of the apportionment methods (for noninteger 2x)</H3>
<p>
<small>ADAMS' METHOD</small>: r(x) = &lceil;x&rceil;    &nbsp;&nbsp; [most favorable to small-pop states]<br>
</p><p>
<small>DEAN'S METHOD</small>: r(x) = if x > hmean then &lceil;x&rceil; else &lfloor;x&rfloor;  where hmean=2/(1/&lceil;x&rceil; + 1/&lfloor;x&rfloor;)<br>
</p><p>
<small>HUNTINGTON-HILL'S METHOD</small>: r(x) = if x > gmean then &lceil;x&rceil; else &lfloor;x&rfloor;  where gmean=&radic;(&lceil;x&rceil;&lfloor;x&rfloor;)<br>
</p><p>
<small>NEW METHOD</small>: r(x) = &lceil;x-0.495&rceil;;
or more generally the magic constant "0.495" can be replaced by one chosen to 
yield the best retrospective performance (least "bias") over past history
(0.495 is optimal in a certain theoretical model with the parameters used in the contemporary USA;
I discuss that <a href="NewAppo.html">elsewhere</a>.)<br>
</p><p>
<small>WEBSTER'S METHOD</small>: r(x) = &lfloor;x+&frac12;&rfloor;;
equivalently
r(x) = if x > amean then &lceil;x&rceil; else &lfloor;x&rfloor;  where amean=(&lceil;x&rceil;+&lfloor;x&rfloor;)/2<br>
</p><p>
<small>JEFFERSON'S METHOD</small>: r(x) = &lfloor;x&rfloor;   &nbsp;&nbsp; [most favorable to large-pop states]<br>
</p><p>
We write "WebsterM" (where M=0 or M=1) for the Webster method with minimum number of
seats m=0 or 1, etc.
For Hill, Dean, and Adams it does not matter whether m=0 or m=1 because these
methods "naturally" enforce 
the one-seat minimum.

<p>
Notation: a "quota violation" is said to occur if some state gets X seats,
as opposed to its ideal fractional number Y, where |X-Y|&gt;1.
Every "divisor method" is known to suffer quota violations in some circumstances,
although the Hamilton/Vinton method (which is not a divisor method) can boast
that it never violates quota.     The best "classic divisor method" in terms of
suffering quota violations the most rarely, evidently is Webster.
</p>
<p>
If we employ 9380 seats instead of 435 (with m=1;
and with either exponential or uniform; both work; note
9380 is the largest House
size currently constitutionally permitted &ndash; 1 person per 30,000
residents), then:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Webster1 is still the least-biased (using Spearman bias).
</li><li>
Webster1, Hill, and Dean all are an order of magnitude less biased than
they were with only 435 seats; 
also, they all have an order of magnitude (or more) smaller chance of having a quota violation.
But that's <i>not</i> the case with Jefferson0, Jefferson1 and
Adams, whose biases <i>increase</i> or stay about the same, and whose chances of
quota-violation remain high (over 97%).
</li></ul>
<p>
In view of these facts we advocate  Webster, in general, as the best of these 5
divisor-based methods, albeit the <a href="NewAppo.html">new</a> method seems even better.
</p>

<p>
The order of small-state favoritism is 
Adams>Dean>Hill>Webster>Jefferson, and Webster's method 
is (at least in the large #seats limit) the 
least biased.  These results are identical to 
<a href="pb88.html">Young's</a>, despite our
different definitions of bias.  Also, Walter F. Willcox, in 1916, did 
the first similar numerical experiments (which was very laborious since that
was before computers!)
which also ended up supporting Webster's method and not Huntington-Hill.
This conclusion was unfortunately not agreed to by the National Academy of Sciences,
which ignored  numerical experiments and preferred Huntington-Hill based on
misleading purely theoretical considerations.
</p><p>
The <i>moral</i> is that this is really an <i>experimental</i> question
that is <i>not</i> soluble purely by theorizing.  That is because the best quality
measures and most realistic population distributions
are beyond the reach of theorem proving &ndash;  but fully within
the reach of computer simulation.
</p>

<H3>Remaining to do???</H3>

<p>
Our <a href="NewAppo.html">new</a> apportionment 
method appears to do even better than Webster (see table above, "new" is now
included).  Should discuss that.  
(And 0.495 does not appear to be the best value; can do even better?)
</p>

<p>
It would be good also to add the Hamilton-Vinton and Balinski-Young 
apportionment methods to our computer simulations above and to redo them all with
millions, not merely 10000, Monte-Carlo experiments.
Also of interest might be "subset" versions of Webster, e.g. where you do Webster
separately on the different subsets of 
states that fall into different population ranges.
