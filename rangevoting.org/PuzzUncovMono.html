Puzzle #??: Independence from covered alternatives &amp; monotonicity
</H2>

<p>
Prove it is impossible for a single-winner voting method based on rank-order ballots
(either deterministic or randomized) to exist
simultaneously satisfying i, ii, iii, iv:
</p><ol type="i">
<li> 
"Independence from covered alternatives":
the winner is always a member of the 
<a href="Glossary.html#Uncovered">uncovered set</a> &ndash;
and who it is, depends only on
the voter-preferences among the uncovered candidates.
</li><li>
"Monotonic": 
if a voter raises candidate
X above Y (and makes no other changes, and no other voter changes their ballot), 
that cannot decrease X's winning chances.
</li><li>
"Perfect-symmetry tiebreak responsiveness":
In a C-candidate election featuring a
perfect symmetrical C-way tie, if identical additional votes are added,
then the candidate those extra votes top-rank, should then have the
greatest winning chances.
</li><li>
Immune to candidate-renamings: if X wins with probability P,
then upon renaming the candidates renamed-X should still win with probability P.
</li></ol>
<p>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Score voting</a>, 
which is <i>not</i> a rank-order ballot system, satisfies
ii, iii, iv and independence from all alternatives besides the winner. 
<small> 
(It does not necessarily elect a member of the uncovered set, albeit if
we change the definition of "X covers Y" to incorporate preference <i>strengths</i> 
instead of ignoring them &ndash; which seems more sensible if one has a score-based ballot
&ndash; then it does, indeed then the score voting winner is the <i>only</i> uncovered candidate.)

<h2> Answer </h2>
<h3> (Both Puzzle &amp; Answer by Forest W. Simmons, July 2010) </h3>

<p>
We shall prove impossibility by deducing a contradiction.
</p><p>
<b>Scenario I:</b>
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th> their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>B>C>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C>A>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>A>B>C</td></tr>
</table>
<b>Scenario II:</b>
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th> their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>D>B>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>B>C>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C>D>B</td></tr>
</table>
Our method must
give greater winning probability to alternative B in scenario I than II.
[Because if we 
rename A&rarr;C, B&rarr;D, C&rarr;B in scenario I then 
we get scenario II; hence our claim is equivalent to claiming
that in scenario I considered alone, B wins with greater probability than C;
and that in turn follows from perfect tiebreak responsiveness.]
</p><p>
Now consider the <b>scenario III:</b>
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th> their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>D>B>C>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C>A>D>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>A>B>C>D</td></tr>
</table>
The uncovered set is {A,B,C} and so by independence from covered alternatives 
the winner is chosen 
according to scenario I.
</p><p>
Now switch A and B in the last voter's ballot to get
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#ccffcc">
<tr><th>#voters</th><th> their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>D>B>C>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C>A>D>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><font color="red">B>A</font>>C>D</td></tr>
</table>
The uncovered set becomes {D,B,C},
and so by independence from covered alternatives the winner is 
chosen according to scenario II.
</p><p>
In summary, solely by raising B relative to A on a ballot,
the winning probability of B decreased.
This contradicts monotonicity.
