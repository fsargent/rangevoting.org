<h3>Election night wins might be tough to call in Minneapolis: The winners
in some races in Minneapolis won't be known instantly under the new
ranked-choice voting system.
</h3>

<b>Not only will it take weeks before all results are known
from the first attempt at ranked-choice voting in Minneapolis, but
some of the election-night results will be misleading.
That was the picture painted Thursday by city election officials</b> as
they conducted a run-through for reporters of the complicated
vote-counting scheme.
City officials expressed confidence that, on election night, they will
be able to post how many people voted and the number of first-,
second- and third-choice votes cast for each candidate. Trouble is,
for each race they won't yet know the key number that determines who
wins: the "threshold," the minimum number of votes a candidate needs
to be elected.
Although it will be safe to say that candidates who post overwhelming
margins are elected, the absence of the key number will make
predicting a winner hazardous in closer races.
Candidates for single-seat races, which can have only one winner, need
to amass one more vote than 50 percent to win. But that is 50 percent
of the valid ballots, after errant ballots are removed. And the city
won't start determining that threshold for winning -- which will vary
by race -- until the day after the election. A lower threshold will be
set for races such as Park Board where there will be multiple winners.
The removal of errant ballots before setting the threshold is mandated
by the ordinance that governs the ranked-choice system approved by
voters in 2006. Voters can have their vote thrown out in a given race
by ranking two candidates as their first choice, for example. Jeanne
Massey of FairVote Minnesota, which advocated for the new methods,
said she expects an error rate of less than 1 percent of votes cast.
Another reason for the delay in tallying is that ballot counters will
need to tally write-in votes before establishing the threshold.
The city plans to transmit periodic updates of results on election
night to the Secretary of State's office for posting on a state
website. Those will include the first-, second- and third-choice votes
for each candidate. But the second- and third-choice votes won't mean
much until first-choice votes alone don't put someone over the
threshold.
That's the stage in single-seat races at which lower-ranking
candidates on first-choice votes are dropped, and the second- or
third-choice votes on those ballots are tallied. That was needed in
more than one-third of the most recent ranked-choice races in San
Francisco and Pierce County, Wash.
How much those added choices can shift an outcome can be illustrated
by the race for county executive in Pierce County last fall, where the
eventual winner ranked almost 9 percentage points behind after the
first ballot.
The good news for voters is that it's easier to cast a ranked-choice
ballot than to count them. A voter may rank up to three candidates in
order of preference, or write in a substitute.
One result that voters should know election night is whether a charter
amendment involving the Board of Estimate and Taxation passes or fails
because that's a yes-no vote without ranked choices.
Unless there are clear-cut winners on first-choice votes, the races
for the three citywide seats on the Park Board and two on the Board of
Estimate and Taxation will be counted last. They feature a more
complicated counting regimen in which both surplus votes over the
threshold accumulated by winners and votes cast by supporters of
dropped candidates are redistributed according to their second or
third choices.

<h3>Waiting is over for newly elected Park Board: With ranked-choice
voting, one of Minneapolis' most competitive races wasn't decided for
17 days
</h3>

<b>What was probably the most drawn-out election count in
Minneapolis election history finally rounded out the makeup of next
year's Park Board</b> on Friday.
Bob Fine, Annie Young and John Erwin won the three at-large seats.
Only Fine hit the election threshold of 25 percent of votes under the
city's ranked-choice voting system. Young hit nearly 23 percent and
Erwin 21 percent before alternate voter choices from dropped
candidates were exhausted.
The race was one of the most competitive in the city because it
featured four incumbents and Erwin, a former commissioner.
Among those losing were Mary Merrill Anderson, who served a term on
the board after stepping down as superintendent, and Tom Nordyke, the
current board chair.
Nordyke said the makeup of the incoming board means it will likely
seek a new superintendent to replace Jon Gurban, whose term expires
June 30.
One factor affecting the race was the failure of the state DFL
organization to get its sample ballot of endorsees, which is
influential in Minneapolis, to voters before the election. A mailing
snafu caused that, which probably cost party endorsees Erwin, Merrill
Anderson and Nordyke votes.
"I think it probably made a pretty big difference," Nordyke said.
Fine's status at the head of the pack continues a remarkable string of
victories for the lawyer and longtime coach despite not winning the
DFL endorsement he has sought several times. He ran citywide after
failing to win endorsement against Brad Bourn, who went on to win
Fine's current southwest Minneapolis district seat.
Neighborhood employee Young, who had the backing of the Green Party,
will start her sixth term. Erwin, a horticulture professor, will be
sworn in for his second term after sitting out a term for family
reasons.
They'll join incumbents Scott Vreeland, Jon Olson and Carol Kummer and
newcomers Liz Wielinski, Anita Tabb and Bourn.
The 17-day wait for election results caused anxiety.
"It's hard," said Merrill Anderson. "Everyone asks me every day, and
you don't have any answer. It really puts you in limbo. How do you
plan for the future -- the future being whether you're on the board?"
Erwin said, "I think it's stressful for everyone. You build up to
election night and you don't know the answer for weeks. There's no
easy way to second-guess the outcome until it happens."
Fine said he was confident but still had anxiety. "I can tell you that
my daughter, who lives in Chicago, has been calling all the time, and
she wants to know right away, so she's nervous," he said.

<h3>Automated ranked-choice a long shot for Minneapolis  in 2012
</h3>

<b>Midway between Minneapolis city elections, it's looking
more doubtful that the city will have new equipment in place for 2013
balloting to avoid another lengthy hand count of voter choices under
ranked-choice voting.
In 2009, it took 18 days after the election and lots more money</b> for
the last winner to be declared after a hand count of second-choice
ballots determined the outcome.
Hennepin County's election director said she hopes the county can buy
new voting equipment in late 2012 or early 2013. Asked how optimistic
she was that such equipment could count the ranked-choice ballots,
Rachel Smith responded, "It's certainly possible. ... I'm still
optimistic that we'll have something in place for Minneapolis."
But she conceded that system may not automate all of the counting
required under ranked-choice when the first choices of voters don't
generate a winner.
In Ramsey County, which runs St. Paul elections, election manager Joe
Mansky said he doubts Minneapolis will have machines in place for 2013
that could count ranked choices automatically.
"I'm not sure there is enough time to get from where they are to where
they need to be," Mansky said after recently finishing St. Paul's only
hand-counted race in one day. He's recommending against automating the
counting of ranked votes in St. Paul, partly because he feels a manual
count is more transparent to candidates and the public.
Ranked-choice voting is used in both Minneapolis and, this month for
the first time, St. Paul. Voters rank municipal candidates in order of
preference, and the second-choice votes of also-rans can determine the
winner. Red Wing and Duluth are considering having voters rank
choices.
The process of aggregating the choices of voters requires software
that hasn't finished the lengthy federal certification process, much
less earned state approval.
That has prompted Jeanne Massey of FairVote Minnesota, the prime
advocacy group supporting ranked-choice voting, to urge that the state
drop the requirement that new voting systems obtain federal
certification before they get state approval. She pointed to Maine,
one of the states where federal certification isn't required, which
helped the city of Portland automate its ranked-choice count.
But Mansky said he'd firmly oppose that, arguing that federal
certification shows the equipment meets federal standards. Any slipup
by a city using noncertified equipment likely would result in a passel
of new laws imposing additional requirements on cities and counties,
he said.
Complicated by differences
Differences in how Minneapolis and St. Paul conduct elections and
count votes complicate the purchase of new voting equipment by several
metro counties that have been working cooperatively toward that.
For example, St. Paul voters rank candidates for council races in one
odd-year election and for mayor two years later. All are single-seat
contests, with one winner for each race. In contrast, city elections
in Minneapolis are every four years. Voters pick a mayor, 13 council
members, nine Park Board members in six district and one at-large
contest, and two members of the Board of Estimate and Taxation.
The park at-large seat and two tax board seats are multiple-seat
elections in which several people are elected, with different
thresholds for winning than single-seat contests like mayor or
council.
The extra cost of ranked-choice voting in 2009 in Minneapolis was
estimated at $345,000 more than the cost of the traditional primary
and general elections it replaced in 2005. A hefty share was for the
space and workers for counting by hand.
"The difficulty is, thus far, we have not identified equipment that's
far enough down the certification path that we feel that confident
that we could obtain ranked-choice voting-compatible equipment by the
end of [2012]," said city clerk Casey Carl.

<h3>Ranked-choice is a mixed bag
</h3>

Another three-way governor's race that will end with a
sub-majority winner has fueled calls for Minnesota to adopt
ranked-choice voting.
In 2009, Minneapolis became the first Minnesota city to use
ranked-choice voting in about 50 years, and its experience offers some
cautions.
The allure of the idea is clear: It has been 16 years and four
elections since a Minnesota governor gained office with more than 50
percent of the vote. Ranked-choice voting is a way to get a winner
with majority backing, even in a three-way race. Proponents say it
allows people to vote for their favorite candidate without fear of
helping to elect their least favorite.
Under the system, a voter lists first, second and third choices, with
lower choices coming into play only if that voter's first pick is
counted out.
But that comes at a cost. Ranking candidates statewide would mean
counting votes by hand, as Minneapolis did last year, or spending
millions of dollars for machines capable of doing the count
automatically.
More would be spent to educate voters. Minneapolis spent 30 percent
more than normal in an election year to launch ranked-choice voting,
chiefly to count votes.
Ranking candidates in Minneapolis failed to accomplish some of the
things advocates promised. It didn't raise participation in the
absence of a close mayoral race. Indeed, fewer voters turned out. It
didn't swell the number of candidates -- 94 filed for municipal
offices in 2005, the last year those elections were held, and 95 did
so last year. The same number of racial minority candidates ran for
office as in 2005.
Also, ranked-choice voting did not change the order of candidates in
any single-seat race. Those who got the most first-choice votes wound
up finishing first in the three single-seat races in which second
choices were tallied to get a winner with majority support.
Four of every 10 voters said in a post-election survey that they
didn't bother to vote for more than one candidate, the whole point of
the new system. Some didn't find more than one candidate acceptable;
others didn't know enough about the field to award a second or third
choice, they told pollsters.
But some say it may be too soon to draw conclusions.
"I'm not sure based on one election what we really learned about it,"
said David Schultz, who teaches election law at Hamline and University
of Minnesota law schools and analyzed Minneapolis' use of
ranked-choice voting. "There may be a lot more being promised here
about what ranked-choice voting can do than what it can deliver."
Some goals realized
Minneapolis is the eighth U.S. city to try ranked-choice voting in
recent times. Most are liberal enclaves where ranking candidates isn't
likely to reshuffle results appreciably, said Schultz, who served
briefly on the board of FairVote Minnesota, which advocates
ranked-choice voting.
The group has had some successes. Minneapolitans approved the ranking
of candidates in a 2006 referendum, with 65 percent supporting the
charter amendment making the switch. According to a St. Cloud State
University post-election survey, an equal percentage of those who said
they voted in the 2009 election thought the city should continue to
use ranked-choice voting, with most respondents finding it simple to
vote.
The same day that Minneapolis voters inaugurated the new system, St.
Paul voters approved a switch to ranked-choice balloting for city
seats, but the charter amendment got a much slimmer margin of support,
with 52.5 percent backing. There also have been discussions of
switching to ranking candidates in Duluth, Red Wing and Hopkins, but
none has a formal charter proposal pending. Hopkins was the last
Minnesota city to use ranked-choice before Minneapolis, dropping it in
1959.
Ranked-choice voting did accomplish some goals. Genuinely undecided
voters got to support more than one candidate. Voters generally gave
the system high marks in the St. Cloud State poll. There were no
indications of mass confusion after more than $100,000 was spent to
prep voters on the new method. Even the hand-counting of ballots,
which delayed some official results for up to 17 days, happened faster
than anticipated.
Hand-counting was needed because no equipment was certified nationally
and in Minnesota to tabulate rankings of candidates. One manufacturer
has since gained federal certification for equipment that it bills as
able to handle the voting method.
Significantly more expensive
The cost of paying workers and renting space to sort ballots by first,
second and third choices was a major reason that ranked-choice voting
cost $345,727 more in Minneapolis than the city's traditional 2005
election. That's despite the city holding both primary and general
elections in 2005, compared to 2009's all-in-one election.
The higher costs for ranked-choice voting are likely to continue
regardless of whether machines are available to count the vote. The
city expects to repeat most of its voter education spending in 2013
after several intervening non-city elections in which traditional
voting will be used. Interim election director Virginia Gelms
estimated the recurring extra cost for ranked-choice voting at
$108,692, even with automated tabulation. That doesn't count the cost
of new machines.
Schultz also called attention to a higher number of voter errors in
2009 than in 2005, some of which vote-counting machines caught and
gave a voter a chance to correct. He called the rate of errors by
voters and spoiled ballots "potentially troublesome" and significant
enough to affect future outcomes.
Hennepin County expects to begin discussions with cities and other
counties next year on replacing its vote-tabulation system, an
expenditure that could top $3 million. Election manager Rachel Smith
said the county will research systems that can accommodate
ranked-choice voting.
The St. Cloud survey found some differences among voters in their use
of the rankings for candidates. The youngest and lowest-income voters
and members of racial minority groups were most likely to use only one
of their three choices.
How many candidates were ranked also varied widely by precinct,
according to a Star Tribune analysis of returns from the 2009 mayoral
contest. The range was from 19 percent using all three choices in one
precinct to 92 percent in another.
Even in one of the most competitive elections -- a five-way contest
for the Nokomis-area park commissioner -- only a third of voters
ranked three candidates.
