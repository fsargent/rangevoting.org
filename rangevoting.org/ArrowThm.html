<H2> Arrow's "impossibility" theorem &ndash; how can range voting accomplish the impossible? </H2>

</small></p>

<p>
According to 
<a href="http://www.sci.wsu.edu/math/Lessons/Voting/Module4_5.html">this voting tutorial</a>
by 
<a href="http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/webb/welcome.html">Prof. William R. Webb</a>,
(from which we now quote verbatim)
Arrow's (1950) theorem states that no voting method
can satisfy the following short list of conditions:
<ol>
<li>
There is no dictator.</li>
<li>
If every voter prefers A to B then so does the group.</li>
<li>
The relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their
relative positions in the individual rankings, but do not depend on the
individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Webb continues:
"That's not just the voting methods we know of now, but any voting method anybody 
might think of in the future as well. This fact is known as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. 
This discovery was a major factor in Arrow winning the Nobel Prize in Economics."
(End of verbatim quoting.)
</p>

<p>
<b>But... wait a minute.</b>
<a href="RangeVoting.html">Range voting</a> satisfies all three
criteria, accomplishing the "impossible"!
Huh?  Let's check that in slow-mo:
<ol>
<li>
There is no dictator &ndash; that is, there exists no 
single range voter ("Joe Stalin") 
who, no matter what the other voters say, always gets it his way.
Check.
</li><li>
If every voter rates A above B, then A's summed-score (and hence average score)
will be higher than B's.  So the finish-order will rank A above B.  
Check.
</li><li>
Jane Voter's score for C in <i>no way</i> affects her scoring of A and B, which
are totally independent scoring decisions made by that voter.  Hence A's and B's
averages (and hence finish-order) are in no way affected by how any and all voters rate C.
Check.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And range voting is not the only voting system accomplishing the "impossible";
many others, such as <a href="OlympBonaly.html#trim">trimmed-mean range voting</a>
which we recommend for judging figure-skating events,
also do so.
</p>

<p>
How can this be?
The explanation is simple.
Arrow, when he made his theorem, made a <i>definition</i> of what a "voting system" was.
His theorem only applies to voting systems that obey his definition.
The trouble is that (in my opinion) Arrow made a silly definition.
One reason it is silly is that,
according to Arrow's definition, range voting is "not" a voting system at all.
It sure looks and feels like a voting system.  It inputs votes and it elects a winner.
But according to Arrow's definition, it isn't a voting system.
(It is pretty easy to prove voting systems "impossible" if, as step one, you <i>define</i>
a lot of voting systems as not being voting systems.)
</p>

<p>
The <i>true lesson</i> of Arrow's theorem 
is (more than anything else, in my opinion) that you should stay away from
voting systems based on rank-order ballots.

Analysis of <a href="NewSciMcKenna.html#ArrowOnRV">why</a> Arrow didn't like range voting.
</small>
</p>
<hr>
<a name="harsanyi"></a>
<h4>Who first pointed this out?</h4>
<p>
Warren D. Smith pointed this out in 2000, and Claude Hillinger
at about the same time.
A few years later 
<a href="ArrowLawr.html">John C. Lawrence</a> went further than them,
making an especially strong criticism of
Arrow:  based on a close look at Arrow's words, Lawrence contends Arrow 
actually did  briefly consider range voting, but dismissed it due to
a mental <i>mistake</i>.
</p><blockquote>
<b>Update (2016):</b>
Ken Arrow has now <a href="ArrowEndorse.html">agreed</a>
(this was in an October 2012 podcast audio interview,
which was recorded) that (1) his impossibility
theorem indeed does not apply to range-voting-type voting systems, and (2)
he believed at the date of that interview that range voting with 3 or 4 levels
probably was "the best" single-winner voting system.
</blockquote><p>
Much earlier than any of these people, economist
John C. Harsanyi had pointed it out in the 1950s shortly after
Arrow's work appeared.  Harsanyi later 
(<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1994/harsanyi-lecture.pdf">1994</a>)
was awarded the Nobel Prize, but, despite that,
his point about Arrow's theorem for
<a href="Hill12.html">some reason</a>
remained largely ignored and unknown.
For example, you can <a href="MaskinArrow.html">read about</a>
how (also Nobel Laureate) Eric Maskin apparently remained ignorant of this as of 2007.

beginning of the 1980s. The main result in this area (known as the resolution of the topological 
social choice paradox) shows that a space of preferences admits of a continuous, anonymous, and 
unanimous aggregation rule for every number of individuals if and only if this space is contractible. 
Furthermore, connections between the Pareto principle, dictatorship, and manipulation were established. 
Recently, Baryshnikov used the topological approach to demonstrate that Arrow's 
impossibility theorem can be reformulated in terms of the noncontractibility of spheres.
This paper discusses these results in a self-contained way, emphasizes the social choice 
interpretation of some topological concepts, and surveys the area of topological aggregation.

A <i>computer-checked</i> proof (based on Geanakoplos') of Arrow's theorem, using the Mizar proof 
assistant, is available by <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/">Freek Wiedijk</a> in a 2009
paper
<a href="WiedijkArrowMizar.pdf">Formalizing Arrow's Theorem (pdf)</a>.
Another is 
<a href="http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~nipkow/pubs/arrow.html">Social Choice Theory in HOL: Arrow and Gibbard-Satterthwaite</a>
(2009)
by <a href="http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~nipkow/">Tobias Nipkow</a>.
(We thank Leon P. Smith for pointing these out.  L.P.Smith also notes:
Range Voting satisfies F.Wiedijk's English-language description of IIA
"For two alternatives a,b&isin;A, it should not be possible for an
individual to change the group decision on the order of a and b by
manipulating his or her preference for a third alternative c" but <i>not</i> his formal
definition in Mizar-language which simply does not make sense for anything
other than rank-order style ballots.  Nipkow's 
formal definition implies Wiedijk's English description, but not vice
versa.  It is fascinating that even these authors going all-out for maximum formality 
still did not seem to appreciate the issues we've raised here.)
</small>

<h4>The fine print</h4>
<small>
<p>
Actually, in his tutorial, Webb did not very carefully state a precise and complete
statement of Arrow's theorem &ndash; he "dumbed it down" for a wide audience.
If he had done so, then Range Voting would (with some theorem versions) disobey 
criterion #3 &ndash; but even in those versions, a system related to range,
called "honest utility voting," still would "impossibly" obey all three Arrow criteria.
The issue is that many voting system criteria were originally carelessly worded by people, such as
Arrow, who simply did not conceive (or if he did he cavalierly dismissed them)
that there might be other voting systems in the universe 
&ndash; such as <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> &ndash;
besides ones employing rank-order ballots.  When you try to employ the criteria to
these more general voting systems, there often are 
several <i>inequivalent</i> ways to word criteria,
all of which happen to be equivalent <i>if</I> we restrict attention to rank-order systems.
That is the case for Arrow's IIA criterion, as well as the 
<a href="MajorityCrit.html">majority criterion</a> and 
<a href="CondDQ.html">Condorcet's criterion</a>.
Thus, <i>under some wordings of these criteria taken verbatim from the
literature, range voting is a Condorcet method, approval voting obeys
the Majority Criterion, and range obeys IIA. 
Under other wordings, none of these are true.</i>
Here, we are simply pointing out that with Webb's wording &ndash; which is
perfectly valid for all rank-order voting systems, which is all 
Arrow was considering &ndash;
Range Voting obeys all three of Arrow's "incompatible" criteria.
</p><P>
For a deeper and more precise look, we recommend W.D.Smith's
survey <a href="WarrenSmithPages/homepage/works.html">paper #79 here</a>
and P.C.Fishburn: Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: Concise 
Proof and Infinite Voters, J. Economic Theory 2,1 (March 1970) 103-106.
Fishburn proves a strictly stronger statement than Arrow's theorem in only 2 pages
(whereas it took Arrow an entire, and rather badly written,
book to prove a weaker statement).

<p>
Forest W. Simmons in July 2010 <a href="PuzzUncovMono.html">proved</a>
an interesting new impossibility theorem related to Arrow's (presumably there is a merged
impossibility theorem unifying them both and stronger than either) and again in this theorem
range voting can be regarded as "accomplishing the impossible."
</p>

<h4> Wilson's impossibility theorem </h4>
<p>
Another famous impossibility theorem is <i>Wilson's impossibility theorem</i>
[Robert B. Wilson: Social choice theory without the Pareto principle, J. Economic Theory 5 (1972) 478-496].
It is quite like Arrow's theorem, but avoids the test about unanimity.
Specifically
</p>
<p>
THEOREM:
Any social choice function satisfying these 2 conditions must be a dictatorship or
reverse-dictatorship
(in both cases a single voter, the "dictator," has total control over the voting system's output-ordering,
either by always getting his vote as the output of the voting system, or by always getting the
<i>reverse</i>  of his vote as the output of the voting system):
<ol>
<li>
The voting system does not always prefer some candidate A over some other B (regardless of the votes).
</li><li>
The relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their
relative positions in the individual rankings, but do not depend on the
individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C (this is the same last condition as Arrow's)
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
<i>Again</i>, range voting "accomplishes the impossible": it is not a dictatorship (reverse or not),
it does not always prefer somebody A over B regardless of the votes, and it obeys the final condition.
It can do that because hidden in the definition of "social choice function" is the requirement that
the ballots must be rank-order ballots.  Range voting uses <i>rating</i> ballots and hence
can evade Wilson's theorem.
</p>
</small>

<h4>My own impossibility theorem </h4>

<p>
Is explained <a href="SimmonsSmithPf.html">here</a>.
Range voting again evades it by not employing rank-order ballots.
</p>

<h4> <i>Unified</i> impossibility theorem via <i>topology</i> </h4>
<small>
<p>
It recently was realized there there is a
<i>unified</i> theorem which combines both Arrow's and the 
<a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard-Satterthwaite</a>
impossibility theorem into a single statement which
may be proven by <i>topological</i> methods.
The entire community of course went into ecstasy when they heard that, since it is 
just so amazingly cool-sounding (although I'm not sure there is any great benefit aside
from sounding cool).
<br>
K. Eliaz: Social aggregators, Social Choice &amp; Welfare 22 (2004) 317-330;
<br>
Yasuhito Tanaka: 
<a href="TanakaTopoEliaz.pdf">A topological proof of Eliaz's unified theorem of 
social choice theory</a>,
Applied Mathematics and Computation 176,1 (May 2006) 83-90.
</p>
<p>
THEOREM:
Any social choice function satisfying these 4 conditions must be a dictatorship:
<ol>
<li>
The voting system always outputs at least one winner.
</li><li>
If the voting system claims A&gt;B and B&ge;C, then it does not claim C&gt;A.
</li><li>
If all voters prefer A&gt;B then the voting system does too.
</li><li>
If in election #1 the voting system says A&gt;B,
but in election #2 (with the same voters)
it says B&gt;A, then at least one voter must have reversed her
preference relation about A and B.
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
I was all ready to say that
once again, range voting "accomplishes the impossible" by satisfying every condition
in this theorem <i>without</i> being a dictatorship &ndash; except it does <i>not</i> because
it <i>is</i> possible for the range voting winner to change from A to B without any voter changing
her opinion that A&gt;B, A&lt;B, or indifferent(A,B) [just changing <i>strengths</i> of preferences can 
suffice].  And I should have known that immediately because I already 
<a href="GibbSat.html">knew</a> that range voting only <i>partially</i>
evades the Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem.
</p>
</small>

<h4>Tanaka's impossibility theorem </h4>
<small>
<p>
Tanaka devised an altered version of Wilson's impossibility theorem which now
involves a "monotonicity" axiom instead of 
Arrow's final condition [Yasuhito Tanaka: A necessary and sufficient condition for
Wilson's impossibility theorem with strict non-imposition, Economics Bulletin 4,17 (2003) 1-8].
However, you are warned that Tanaka's notion of "monotonicity" is 
nontraditional and probably not what you were expecting...
</p><p>
THEOREM:
Any social choice function satisfying these 2 conditions must be a dictatorship or
reverse-dictatorship:
<ol>
<li>
The voting system does not always prefer some candidate A over some other B (regardless of the votes).
</li><li>
Either:
<ol type="a"><li>
Whenever the voting system says X&gt;Y and then the votes change in such a way that:
every voter who was
indifferent about X versus Y changes her vote to say X&gt;Y and
every voter who had voted X&gt;Y still says X&gt;Y in her (new) vote,
then the voting system always still outputs the social preference X&gt;Y ("monotonicity") <i>OR</i>
</li><li>
Whenever the voting system says Y&gt;X and then
the votes change in such a way that:
every voter who was
indifferent about X versus Y changes her vote to say X&gt;Y
and
every voter who had voted X&gt;Y still votes X&gt;Y in her (new) vote,
then the voting system still outputs the social preference Y&gt;X ("reverse monotonicity").
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Remark:</b>
One might have thought that <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>
voting was a counterexample to this theorem.  It isn't.  Tanaka explains:
while Borda is normally considered "monotonic," it is not under his (nontraditional) definition.
A counterexample is
</p>
<table bgcolor="lightpink" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td>Voter#1:</td><td> X&gt;Y&gt;Z&gt;W </td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter#2:</td><td> W&gt;X&gt;Y&gt;Z </td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter#3:</td><td> W&gt;X&gt;Y&gt;Z </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Here <b>X</b> is the winner with 7=3+2+2 points, and W is the runner-up with 6=0+3+3 points.
If Voter#1 changes her vote to "X&gt;W&gt;Y&gt;Z" then <b>W</b> becomes the winner with 8=2+3+3 points,
<i>despite</i> the fact that Voter#1 did not change her vote's preference X&gt;W and no voter
was indifferent.
This contradicts Tanaka's definition 2a of monotonicity.
</p>
<p>
Does
range voting "accomplish the impossible" by satisfying the assumptions of, while disobeying
the conclusion of, Tanaka's theorem? 
<i>No</i>, because Range Voting <i>also</i> is "non-monotonic" under
Tanaka's definition (although again normally considered monotone).
</p>
</small>

<h4>A 1-sentence (partial) proof of Arrow's Theorem </h4>
<p>
It is possible to prove Arrow's theorem
<i>for election methods which reduce to simple-majority  in the 2-candidate case</i>
in only <i>one sentence</i>: Consider a Condorcet-cycle scenario such
as <a href="IncentToExagg.html">this</a> and note that removing a non-winning candidate
changes the winner. Q.E.D.
