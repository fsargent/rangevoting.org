<H2> With strategic voters,
Condorcet voting can fail to elect Condorcet Winner </H2>

<p>
<b>A myth about Condorcet voting:</b>
Although Condorcet is
vulnerable to strategic
voting, it supposedly is only vulnerable in cycle situations with no Condorcet
winner.
</p>
<p>
<b>The bust:</b>
In fact it is vulnerable in situations with an honest Condorcet winner
too:
Let there be 3 candidates A,B,C (or there could be more D,E,...; it'll
still work).
Suppose C is the honest-voter Condorcet winner, with slight pairwise victories over
A,B,...; and A has large pairwise victories over everybody but C.
The A-voters instead of honestly voting A>C>B>... strategically vote A>B>...>C.
This causes C no longer to be the Condorcet winner. 
In fact C now loses pairwise (by moderate margins) to every candidate except A.
And A now wins pairwise over every candidate except C, who
beats A by slight margin.
Now A is the winner under all these popular Condorcet
methods (plus more too, if you arrange it right):
Schulze beatpaths, Tideman ranked pairs,
basic Condorcet, Simpson-Kramer minmax.
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
Strategic Condorcet voters can fail to elect a Condorcet winner.
Strategic range or approval voters will, however, elect an
honest-voter Condorcet winner
under certain (in practice highly reasonable) assumptions, as is proven by
<a href="AppCW.html">this theorem</a>.
</p>

<H2> But... with <i>counter</i>strategy... </H2>

<p>
If the other voters "catch on" to the strategic action
and realize it is coming down to an A vs. C battle,
then they can also alter their votes to try to maximally impact that 
battle by always ranking A and C top and bottom (or the reverse)
regardless of their honest rankings of A, C, and everybody else.
If all voters do that, <i>then</i> C (if it truly is an honest-voter Condorcet winner)
again will win.  If C is <i>not</i> an honest-voter Condorcet winner,
then still either A or C will then always win.
However, observe that the voters had to pay a heavy price in dishonesty to
do that.  With <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a>, voters
who wish to rank A and C top and bottom are <i>not</i> thereby
prevented from ranking their truly favorite and truly most-hated candidates
top and bottom;  range voting thus permits somebody other than A or C to win.

<h2> Details </h2>

<p>
Some readers have insisted this was not obvious enough, they could not conceive of this
kind of phenomenon, etc, hence they require a fully-worked out
random-looking numerical example.  (I personally thought it <i>was</i> obvious,
but "the reader is always right.")
So here is a set of 21 ballots for 4 candidates:
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow">
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><th>#voters</th><th>Their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A>C>B>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>B>C>A>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>B>A>C>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>C>D>A>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>C>B>A>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>D>C>A>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>D>A>C>B</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The defeats-margins matrix is:
</p>

<table  bgcolor="#cccccc" border="2">
<tr><td>Option</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">B</td><td align="center">C</td><td align="center">D</td></tr><tr><td align="center">A</td><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">14</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">10</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">13</td></tr><tr><td align="center">B</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">7</td><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">5</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">13</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">11</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">16</td><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">0</td><td bgcolor="#CCFF88">15</td></tr><tr><td align="center">D</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">8</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">8</td><td bgcolor="#FF8888">6</td><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">0</td></tr></table>

<p>
<b>C wins</b> (with every Condorcet voting system) because C has
a victory pairwise versus each rival, indicated by the all-green row.
</p>

<p>
Now <b>A</b>'s 6 supporters naturally are not happy about that.
What can they do to make their man win?
There is one, and basically only one, 
change to their "A>C>B>D" vote they can make which causes A
to win. 
That is to "bury" C with "A>B>D>C."  
(Well, the alternate burials A>D>B>C and A>D>C>B
also work in this example, but they both are at-least-as-dishonest votes
and anyway still count as burying C.)
If they do this, we get
</p>

<table bgcolor="yellow">
<tr bgcolor="#ffcccc"><th>#voters</th><th>Their vote</th></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td bgcolor="#8888ff">A>B>D>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>B>C>A>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>B>A>C>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>C>D>A>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>C>B>A>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>D>C>A>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>D>A>C>B</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
whereupon <b>A wins</b> using every one of these Condorcet methods:
Tideman ranked pairs,
Basic Condorcet,
Simpson-Kramer min-max,
and 
Schulze beatpaths. (Success!)
The new defeats matrix is

<h2> How common is this? </h2>
<a name="estim"></a>
<p>
Some people think maybe it is very rare for Condorcet methods to suffer from this problem.
But there are <a href="CondBurial.html">theorems</a> to the contrary.
Here we shall work out a crude estimate for the rarity.
</p>
<p>
We shall look at the
(admittedly simplified versus reality, but at least it is clearly defined
and not biased) <a href="RandElect.html">random elections model</a>.
In this model, each voter
casts a random vote chosen uniformly independently from among all possible
votes.  (E.g, with 4 candidates, there are 4!=24 possible votes. Each voter chooses one
by flipping a dodecahedral die and a coin.)  
</p><P>
Equivalent interpretation:
"All V-voter elections are considered equally likely" where
an "election" means a table saying, for each voter, how they voted.
(That is what I mean by "unbiased."  Clearly I cannot be inserting any evil personal biases
favoring one particular kind of elections, because <i>all</i> elections are equally likely.)
We assume a <i>large</i> number V&rarr;&infin; of voters.
</p>
<p>
In this model, it is known that
a "Condorcet winner" candidate C exists (in 4-candidate elections)
with probability 
<a href="RandElect.html">82.452%</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>ESTIMATE:</b>
With the "Tideman ranked pairs" Condorcet method, with
probability&asymp;45% (or more) in the V&rarr;&infin; limit,
some voter-type whose vote was "X>C>the others"  
(for some X, where C is the honest-voting Condorcet winner),
can force victory for X (assuming all the other voter-types stay with their
honest votes) by strategically changing their vote to "bury" C, like this "X>others>C."
</p>
<p>
<b>DERIVATION:</b>
Restricted to the three non-C candidates, there is somebody who would
win (since ties have probability&rarr;0).  Call that somebody X.
This strategic move by the X>C>others voters
will, with probability&rarr;100% (which follows from standard
Gaussian statistics), cause C to become pairwise-defeated by every candidate except X,
and always by the 2 largest pairwise margins.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this strategic move, we now have a situation in which X would
win if C were omitted from the race, and in which C loses to every rival but X
by the hugest two margins.  With Tideman's Condorcet
method, C's defeats are "locked in"
first.  Now X will win if either of the one or two X>somebody defeats
is large enough to get locked in before the C>X defeat.
That happens with probability&asymp;2/3 because there are 6 possible orderings
of these 3 defeats by severity, and only 2 of those orderings stop
X from winning &ndash; or in the case where X only defeats one of his 
non-C rivals we get probability&asymp;1/2.  So on average say 58%.
(This is really cheating because the orderings are 
not equally likely because X and C are not random candidates, etc.  
So this argument is only approximate, which is why we call it an "estimate" not a "theorem."
One could do a computer Monte-Carlo measurement to overcome that objection and thus get
the exact probability to within 0.01%.  One can also see <a href="CondBurial.html">this</a>
for genuine theorems.)
Finally, 0.8245&times;0.58&asymp;45%.
<b>Q.E.D.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
This whole "burial strategy works" phenomenon seems <i>very</i> common.
In the random elections model using Tideman ranked pairs, it happens at least 
about 45% of the time.
With many other Condorcet methods and other probabilistic models,
your mileage may differ, but it ought still to be quite common.
</p><p>
<small>
If you want a precise conjecture: I suspect <i>every</i> commonly-accepted Condorcet method
will exhibit "burial strategy works" over 30% of the time in random elections 
with 4 candidates and #voters&rarr;&infin;; and with some number more than 4 candidates,
I believe burial will work even more often.
In the <a href="Glossary.html#Dirichlet">Dirichlet model</a>, 
I suspect again we will have &gt;30% occurrence rates
provided the number of candidates is right.
<br><br>
Also, if we were to add in the chances that some voter-class could cause the election result to
<i>impove</i> in their view (despite not necessarily electing their favorite) by
burying the winner, then the estimate "45%" would rise, and if there were the right number of
candidates, it'd rise by a <i>lot</i>.
