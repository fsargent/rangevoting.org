<H2> About Endorsing CRV goals </H2>

<p>
CRV cannot change the world unless the right people listen to our ideas.
They won't do that unless they can see our ideas already have a lot of support.
So we need a lot of endorsements.
We want over 1000 endorsers.
If you click the <a href="ComboEndorse2.html">Endorse</a> link,
you will be taken to a page containing a number of statements
you can choose to endorse or not (independent choice for each).
You then will be asked to fill out a form &ndash;
and you will not need to reveal private information beyond your name and
regional-location
&ndash; and presto, your name
will be glorified by addition to the 
<a href="gbook/top100.html">endorsers list</a>.
