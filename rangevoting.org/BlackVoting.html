<H2>  Black suffrage </H2>

<!-- <p><small><a href="#summ">skip to summary</a></small></p> -->

<p>
How important is it, for democracy, that black people can vote?
</p>

<p>
This was a big step forward for democracy.  
In the USA's South during about 1900-1970, blacks were almost wholly disenfranchised by "Jim Crow."
This has led some authors to claim that the USA was not a democracy before the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
But let's make a more quantitative assessment so that we can compare with, e.g,
the importance of women's suffrage.
How many election results have actually been directly changed by black votes?
</p>
<p>
Women since 1980 have voted more Democratic than men (the "gender gap")
with, e.g. 54/43% of women voting Gore/Bush in 2000 versus
42/53% of men.  (CNN's Voter News Service exit polls.)
We can directly compare women with blacks because
blacks also favored Gore by 90-10 over Bush (versus 42-54 among whites).
</p>
<p>
In 2004 both the race and gender gaps were somewhat smaller but still there and still
pointing in the same directions.
CNN's exit polls said
men favored Bush/Kerry by 55/44% while
for women it was 48/51%.
Whites favored Bush/Kerry by 58/41% while
for African-Americans it was the opposite: 11/88%.
(The overall count was Bush 51%, Kerry 48%.)
</p>
<p>
Let's compare the effects of Blacks and Women in these two elections combined.
Women were 54% of the voters and differed from the mean by 4.8% yielding net 
perturbing effect
(the product of these two numbers) <b>2.6%</b>.
Blacks were 11% of the voters and differed from the mean by 41% yielding
net effect <b>4.5%</b>.
So even though blacks are far fewer than women in numbers, they currently
actually have
a greater vote-shifting effect.  
In that sense, enfranchising blacks was actually a greater step
forward for US democracy, than enfranchising women.
