<H2>  Condorcet voting systems (Executive summary) </H2>

<ol>
<li>
Condorcet voting systems are more <b>complicated</b> than range voting
(and the best Condorcet voting systems are <a href="SchulzeComplic.html">much</a> 
more complicated).
This probably already is sufficient to make them politically 
<a href="WhatVotersWant.html">unadoptable</a>.
</li>
<li>
Range voting is more <a href="SmittyExp.html">expressive</a> than Condorcet voting.
</li>
<li>
Condorcet voting systems are not usable on many of today's 
<a href="VotMach.html">voting machines</a>.
But range voting
<i>is</i> usable on every voting machine in the USA, including
noncomputerized ones
(and usually easily), right now, without modification and without reprogramming.
That makes range more adoptable with less pain and expense.
</li>
<li>
The fundamental idea (by Condorcet) which lies behind these systems, also is
satisfied by range voting, i.e. there is a (<a href="CondDQ.html">nontraditional</a> 
but arguably better) way to define "Condorcet system"
that (a) is compatible with all previous applications of the term to
voting systems found in all previous political science books, and 
(b) under which range voting
is also a "Condorcet system."
</li>
<li>
The traditional Condorcet property sounds good at first but has
numerous disadvantages such as the <a href="rangeVcond.html#slaves">free the slaves</a> vote,
the 
"<a href="DH3.html">DH3 pathology</a>,"
and
<a href="FishburnAntiC.html">Fishburn's counterexample to Condorcet being 
a &quot;good&quot; thing</a> and
<a href="CondCoursera.html">Condorcet self-contradiction example</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="VenzkePf.html">All</a> Condorcet systems exhibit "favorite betrayal."
In a 3-way election like
Bush v Gore v Nader 2000, 
voters are tempted to
exaggerate their good and bad opinions of Bush and Gore by artificially ranking them 
first and last, even if they truly feel Nader is best or worst. 
If that happens, then Nader cannot win.
The result of that, over time, would be 
self-reinforcing <b><a href="Duverger.html">2-party domination</a></b>,
causing Condorcet not to be much if any improvement over
plain plurality voting.
<br><br>
There is good <a href="IRVStratPf.html">reason</a>
to believe (or at least suspect) that this pathology <i>will</i> happen
with every Condorcet system, but that it will <i>not</i> happen with range voting.
For example about 90% of <a href="AusAboveTheLine07.html">Australians</a>
vote in this exaggerated manner on their
rank-order ballots.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, with range voting, even if every voter exaggerates and ranks Gore=99, Bush=0
(or the reverse) then Nader <i>still</i> has a very realistic possibility of winning
(without any ties required) so there is no obvious reason we will
get 2-party domination.
</li>
<li>
Counterintuitively, we can prove that (under reasonable assumptions about strategic voter behavior)
Approval and traditional-Condorcet voting
actually are <i>not</i> in conflict
(<a href="AppCW.html">no-conflict theorem</a>) and it 
is plausible that range and approval voting 
both will actually be <i>more likely</i> in practice to elect honest-voter Condorcet 
winners, than "official"
Condorcet methods!  [<a href="RangeYieldsCondSumm.html">Summary</a> of the model.]
<p>
And because strategic range voters generally vote approval-style, the same would
be true of <a href="RangeVoting.html">range voting</a> elections with strategic voters.
In other words:
<ul>
<li>
To the extent range voters are <i>strategic</i> they will elect
Condorcet winners (indeed quite likely doing so <i>more often</i> than
"official" Condorcet methods);
</li><li>
whereas to the extent they are <i>honest</i>,
range voting should perform 
<a href="rangeVcond.html#slaves">better</a> than Condorcet.
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>
Even if you don't quite totally buy all that, we think the logical force of this still
should be enough to convince you that,
in practice, one cannot expect any great advantage for Condorcet methods over the
much <i>simpler</i> range voting system.
</li>
</ol>
