<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announcing the judgments of the Court in an opinion
expressing his own view of the cases.</b>
<p>In these suits certain States resist compliance with the Voting Rights
Act Amendments of 1970, Pub. L. 91-285, 84 Stat. 314, because they believe
that the Act takes away from them powers reserved to the States by the
Constitution to control their own elections. By its terms the Act does
three things. First: It lowers the minimum age of voters in both state
and federal elections from 21 to 18. Second: Based upon a finding by Congress
that literacy tests have been used to discriminate against voters on account
of their color, the Act enforces the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
by barring the use of such tests in all elections, state and national,
for a five-year period. Third: The Act forbids States from disqualifying
voters in national elections for presidential and vice-presidential electors
because they have not met state residency requirements.
<p>For the reasons set out in Part I of this opinion, I believe Congress
can fix the age of voters in national elections, such as congressional,
senatorial, vice-presidential and presidential elections, but cannot set
the voting age in state and local elections. For reasons expressed in separate
opinions, my Brothers DOUGLAS, BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL join me in
concluding that Congress can enfranchise 18-year-old citizens in national
elections, but dissent from the judgment that Congress cannot extend the
franchise to 18-year-old citizens in state and local elections. For reasons
expressed in separate opinions, my Brothers THE CHIEF JUSTICE, HARLAN,
STEWART, and BLACKMUN join me in concluding that Congress cannot interfere
with the age for voters set by the States for state and local elections.
They, however, dissent from the judgment that Congress can control voter
qualifications in federal elections. In summary, it is the judgment of
the Court that the 18-year-old vote provisions of the Voting Rights Act
Amendments of 1970 are constitutional and enforceable insofar as they pertain
to federal elections and unconstitutional and unenforceable insofar as
they pertain to state and local elections.
<p>For the reasons set out in Part II of this opinion, I believe that Congress,
in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments,
can prohibit the use of literacy tests or other devices used to discriminate
against voters on account of their race in both state and federal elections.
For reasons expressed in separate opinions, all of my Brethren join me
in this judgment. Therefore the literacy-test provisions of the Act are
upheld.
<p>For the reasons set out in Part III of this opinion, I believe Congress
can set residency requirements and provide for absentee balloting in elections
for presidential and vice-presidential electors....
<p>Let judgments be entered accordingly.

<h3>
I</h3></center>
The Framers of our Constitution provided in Art. I, 2, that members of
the House of Representatives should be elected by the people and that the
voters for Representatives should have "the Qualifications requisite for
Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature." Senators
were originally to be elected by the state legislatures, but under the
Seventeenth Amendment Senators are also elected by the people, and voters
for Senators have the same qualifications as voters for Representatives.
In the very beginning the responsibility of the States for setting the
qualifications of voters in congressional elections was made subject to
the power of Congress to make or alter such regulations if it deemed it
advisable to do so. This was done in Art. I, 4, of the Constitution which
provides: "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators
and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,
except as to the Places of chusing Senators."
<p>Moreover, the power of Congress to make election regulations in national
elections is augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause....
<p>In short, the Constitution allotted to the States the power to make
laws regarding national elections, but provided that if Congress became
dissatisfied with the state laws, Congress could alter them....
<p>On the other hand, the Constitution was also intended to preserve to
the States the power that even the Colonies had to establish and maintain
their own separate and independent governments, except insofar as the Constitution
itself commands otherwise. My Brother HARLAN has persuasively demonstrated
that the Framers of the Constitution intended the States to keep for themselves,
as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections. My
major disagreement with my Brother HARLAN is that, while I agree as to
the States' power to regulate the elections of their own officials, I believe,
contrary to his view, that Congress has the final authority over federal
elections. No function is more essential to the separate and independent
existence of the States and their governments than the power to determine
within the limits of the Constitution the qualifications of their own voters
for state, county, and municipal offices and the nature of their own machinery
for filling local public offices. Moreover, Art. I, 2, is a clear indication
that the Framers intended the States to determine the qualifications of
their own voters for state offices, because those qualifications were adopted
for federal offices unless Congress directs otherwise under Art. I, 4.
It is a plain fact of history that the Framers never imagined that the
national Congress would set the qualifications for voters in every election
from President to local constable or village alderman. It is obvious that
the whole Constitution reserves to the States the power to set voter qualifications
in state and local elections, except to the limited extent that the people
through constitutional amendments have specifically narrowed the powers
of the States.... The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
was never intended to destroy the States' power to govern themselves, making
the Nineteenth and Twenty-fourth Amendments superfluous. My Brother BRENNAN's
opinion, if carried to its logical conclusion, would, under the guise of
insuring equal protection, blot out all state power, leaving the 50 States
as little more than impotent figureheads. In interpreting what the Fourteenth
Amendment means, the Equal Protection Clause should not be stretched to
nullify the States' powers over elections which they had before the Constitution
was adopted and which they have retained throughout our history.
<p>Of course, the original design of the Founding Fathers was altered by
the Civil War Amendments and various other amendments to the Constitution.
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Nineteenth Amendments have expressly
authorized Congress to "enforce" the limited prohibitions of those amendments
by "appropriate legislation." The Solicitor General contends in these cases
that Congress can set the age qualifications for voters in state elections
under its power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment....
<p>As broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.
Specifically, there are at least three limitations upon Congress' power
to enforce the guarantees of the Civil War Amendments. First, Congress
may not by legislation repeal other provisions of the Constitution. Second,
the power granted to Congress was not intended to strip the States of their
power to govern themselves or to convert our national government of enumerated
powers into a central government of unrestrained authority over every inch
of the whole Nation. Third, Congress may only "enforce" the provisions
of the amendments and may do so only by "appropriate legislation...."
<p>In enacting the 18-year-old vote provisions of the Act now before the
Court. Congress made no legislative findings that the 21-year-old vote
requirement was used by the States to disenfranchise voters on account
of race. I seriously doubt that such a finding, if made, could be supported
by substantial evidence. Since Congress has attempted to invade an area
preserved to the States by the Constitution without a foundation for enforcing
the Civil War Amendments' ban on racial discrimination, I would hold that
Congress has exceeded its powers in attempting to lower the voting age
in state and local elections. On the other hand, where Congress legislates
in a domain not exclusively reserved by the Constitution to the States,
its enforcement power need not be tied so closely to the goal of eliminating
discrimination on account of race....
<p>The generalities of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
were not designed or adopted to render the States impotent to set voter
qualifications in elections for their own local officials and agents in
the absence of some specific constitutional limitations....
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</b>
<p>From the standpoint of this Court's decisions during an era of judicial
constitutional revision in the field of the suffrage, ushered in eight
years ago by Baker v. Carr (1962), I would find it difficult not to sustain
all three aspects of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, here challenged.
From the standpoint of the bedrock of the constitutional structure of this
Nation, these cases bring us to a crossroad that is marked with a formidable
"Stop" sign. That sign compels us to pause before we allow those decisions
to carry us to the point of sanctioning Congress' decision to alter state-determined
voter qualifications by simple legislation, and to consider whether sound
doctrine does not in truth require us to hold that one or more of the changes
which Congress has thus sought to make can be accomplished only by constitutional
amendment....
<p>I think that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment makes it clear
beyond any reasonable doubt that no part of the legislation now under review
can be upheld as a legitimate exercise of congressional power under that
Amendment....
<p>In attempting to unravel what was seldom articulated, the appropriate
starting point is the fact that the framers of the Amendment expected the
most significant portion of 1 to be the clause prohibiting state laws "which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."
These privileges were no doubt understood to include the ones set out in
the first section of the Civil Rights Act. To be prohibited by law from
enjoying these rights would hardly be consistent with full membership in
a civil society....
<p>The history of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to suffrage qualifications
is remarkably free of the problems which bedevil most attempts to find
a reliable guide to present decision in the pages of the past. Instead,
there is virtually unanimous agreement, clearly and repeatedly expressed,
that 1 of the Amendment did not reach discriminatory voter qualifications.
In this rather remarkable situation, the issue of the bearing of the historical
understanding on constitutional interpretation squarely arises.
<p>I must confess to complete astonishment at the position of some of my
Brethren that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment has become irrelevant.
In the six years since I first set out much of this history, I have seen
no justification for such a result which appears to me at all adequate.
With matters in this posture, I need do no more by way of justifying my
reliance on these materials than sketch the familiar outlines of our constitutional
system.
<p>When the Constitution with its original Amendments came into being,
the States delegated some of their sovereign powers to the Federal Government,
surrendered other powers, and expressly retained all powers not delegated
or surrendered. Amdt. X. The power to set state voting qualifications was
neither surrendered nor delegated, except to the extent that the guarantee
of a republican form of government may be thought to require a certain
minimum distribution of political power. The power to set qualifications
for voters for national office, created by the Constitution, was expressly
committed to the States by Art. I, 2, and Art. II, 1. By Art. V, States
may be deprived of their retained powers only with the concurrence of two-thirds
of each House of Congress and three-fourths of the States. No one asserts
that the power to set voting qualifications was taken from the States or
subjected to federal control by any Amendment before the Fourteenth. The
historical evidence makes it plain that the Congress and the States proposing
and ratifying that Amendment affirmatively understood that they were not
limiting state power over voting qualifications....
<p>As the Court is not justified in substituting its own views of wise
policy for the commands of the Constitution, still less is it justified
in allowing Congress to disregard those commands as the Court understands
them. Although Congress' expression of the view that it does have power
to alter state suffrage qualifications is entitled to the most respectful
consideration by the judiciary, coming as it does from a coordinate branch
of government, this cannot displace the duty of this Court to make an independent
determination whether Congress has exceeded its powers. The reason for
this goes beyond Marshall's assertion that: "It is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." It inheres
in the structure of the constitutional system itself. Congress is subject
to none of the institutional restraints imposed on judicial decisionmaking;
it is controlled only by the political process. In Article V, the Framers
expressed the view that the political restraints on Congress alone were
an insufficient control over the process of constitution making. The concurrence
of two-thirds of each House and of three-fourths of the States was needed
for the political check to be adequate. To allow a simple majority of Congress
to have final say on matters of constitutional interpretation is therefore
fundamentally out of keeping with the constitutional structure. Nor is
that structure adequately protected by a requirement that the judiciary
be able to perceive a basis for the congressional interpretation, the only
restriction laid down in Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966)....
<p>Whether a state judgment has so exceeded the bounds of reason as to
authorize federal intervention is not a matter as to which the political
process is intrinsically likely to produce a sounder or more acceptable
result. It is a matter of the delicate adjustment of the federal system.
In this area, to rely on Congress would make that body a judge in its own
cause. The role of final arbiter belongs to this Court....
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL
dissent from the judgments insofar as they declare 302 unconstitutional
as applied to state and local elections, and concur in the judgments in
all other respects, for the following reasons....</b>
<p>The final question presented by these cases is the propriety of Title
III of the 1970 Amendments, which forbids the States from disenfranchising
persons over the age of 18 because of their age. Congress was of the view
that this prohibition, embodied in 302 of the Amendments, was necessary
among other reasons in order to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. See 301 (a) (2), (b). The States involved in
the present litigation question the assertion of congressional power to
make that judgment.
<p>It is important at the outset to recognize what is not involved in these
cases. We are not faced with an assertion of congressional power to regulate
any and all aspects of state and federal elections, or even to make general
rules for the determination of voter qualifications. Nor are we faced with
the assertion that Congress is possessed of plenary power to set minimum
ages for voting throughout the States. Every State in the Union has conceded
by statute that citizens 21 years of age and over are capable of intelligent
and responsible exercise of the right to vote. The single, narrow question
presented by these cases is whether Congress was empowered to conclude,
as it did, that citizens 18 to 21 years of age are not substantially less
able.
<p>We believe there is serious question whether a statute granting the
franchise to citizens 21 and over while denying it to those between the
ages of 18 and 21 could, in any event, withstand present scrutiny under
the Equal Protection Clause. Regardless of the answer to this question,
however, it is clear to us that proper regard for the special function
of Congress in making determinations of legislative fact compels this Court
to respect those determinations unless they are contradicted by evidence
far stronger than anything that has been adduced in these cases. We would
uphold 302 as a valid exercise of congressional power under 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment.....
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE
BLACKMUN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part....</b>
<p>I disagree with the Court's conclusion that Congress could constitutionally
reduce the voting age to 18 for federal elections, since I am convinced
that Congress was wholly without constitutional power to alter - for the
purpose of any elections - the voting age qualifications now determined
by the several States....
<p>The Constitution withholds from Congress any general authority to change
by legislation the qualifications for voters in federal elections. The
meaning of the applicable constitutional provisions is perfectly plain.
Article I, 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment prescribe the qualifications
for voters in elections to choose Senators and Representatives: they "shall
have the Qualifications&nbsp;<font color="#005500"><font size=-1> </font></font>requisite
for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature." The
Constitution thus adopts as the federal standard the standard which each
State has chosen for itself. Accordingly, a state law that purported to
establish distinct qualifications for congressional elections would be
invalid as repugnant to Art. I, 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment. By the
same token, it cannot be gainsaid that federal legislation that had no
objective other than to alter the qualifications to vote in congressional
elections would be invalid for the same reasons. What the Constitution
has fixed may not be changed except by constitutional amendment.
<p>Contrary to the submission of my Brother BLACK, Art. I, 4, does not
create in the Federal Legislature the power to alter the constitutionally
established qualifications to vote in congressional elections. That section
provides that the legislatures in each State shall prescribe the "Times,
Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,"
but reserves in Congress the power to "make or alter such Regulations,
except as to the Places of causing Senators." The "manner" of holding elections
can hardly be read to mean the qualifications for voters, when it is remembered
that 2 of the same Art. I explicitly speaks of the "qualifications" for
voters in elections to choose Representatives. It is plain, in short, that
when the Framers meant qualifications they said "qualifications." That
word does not appear in Art. I, 4. Moreover, 4 does not give Congress the
power to do anything that a State might not have done, and, as pointed
out above, no State may establish distinct qualifications for congressional
elections.....
