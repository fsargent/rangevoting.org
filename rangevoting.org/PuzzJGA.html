Puzzle #112: Probabilities voting methods "vulnerable to strategy"
</H2>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b><br>
A single-winner election with honest voters and some given voting method will be called
"vulnerable to strategy" if there exist some subset of the voters, who, by changing 
their votes, could cause the winner to change to somebody else whom that subset (unanimously) 
prefers.
[This subset is <i>not</i> required to consist of identical voters; their honest 
and/or strategic votes both are allowed to be multi-element sets.]
This puzzle investigates the probability that an election is vulnerable to strategy, in
the <a href="RandElect.html">random election model</a> (also called the "impartial culture")
with V&rarr;&infin; voters.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
In 2-candidate simple-majority elections, show every election is invulnerable to strategy.
Hence in the rest of this problem assume the number N of candidates is fixed with N&ge;3.
</li><li>
For plain <a href="Plurality.html">plurality</a>, <a href="rangeVborda.html">Borda</a>, 
and indeed <i>every</I> nontrivial <a href="WtPositnl.html">weighted positional</a> method,
show that the strategy-vulnerability probability&rarr;1.
</li><li>
Also show this for "Coombs elimination" (whose rules are: the candidate with the greatest number 
of last-place rankings is repeatedly eliminated until only one remains &ndash; the winner).
</li><li>
Show for <a href="Approval.html">approval</a> voting where the honest voters approve the 
top-F-fraction of the N candidates, for any fixed F with 1/N&le;F&le;1-1/N, that the 
strategy-vulnerability probability&rarr;1.
</li><li>
Show for range voting the strategy-vulnerability probability&rarr;1.
</li><li>
Show for <a href="MedianVrange.html">median-based</a> range voting the 
strategy-vulnerability probability&rarr;1.
(This is despite the theorem by Balinski &amp; Laraki that median-based range voting is
"optimum" in terms of <i>their</i> definition of "vulnerability to strategy.")
</li><li>
Argue that for most Condorcet methods (including Nanson-Baldwin, Schulze-beatpaths,
and least-reversal "basic" Condorcet), the strategy-vulnerability probability&rarr;1.
</li><li>
<i>However</i>, show for Instant Runoff Voting (<a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>),
and also for the following two Condorcet methods which somewhat resemble IRV in their workings:
<a href="TidemanRev.html#WBSIRV">WBS-IRV</a>
and
<a href="BtrIrv.html">BTR-IRV</a>, 
that the strategy-vulnerability probability goes to a <i>constant</I> depending on N,
and for each N with 3&le;N&lt;&infin; the constant is strictly positive
(and also is below 1 if N=3, and presumably below 1 for every fixed N with 3&le;N&lt;&infin;).
[Incidentally, note: plain IRV is <i>not</i> a Condorcet method.]
However, for IRV the constant goes to 1 when N&rarr;&infin;.
</li><li>
Find upper and lower bounds and/or estimates, for these constants.
Note by this measure, IRV is "superior" to Borda, Approval, Plurality, and most Condorcet methods;
can you argue that WBS-IRV and/or BTR-IRV in turn are "superior" to IRV?
</li><li>
Further, argue that for a <i>very wide class</i> of voting methods (seemingly including all 
"reasonable" ones), the liminf probability of vulnerability to strategy exceeds some positive 
constant.
</li><li>
<i>But</i>: 
<a href="PuzzJGA.html#JGAcrit">criticize</a> our definition of "vulnerable to strategy" 
and indeed criticize the <i>whole idea</i> of comparing voting methods based on the "probability
in the random election model of vulnerability to strategy" as misleading.
Find some <a href="PuzzJGA.html#theex">examples</a>
of (also reasonable-sounding) alternate definitions/models
in which some of the above results become quite different.

<h2> Answers (some intentionally sketchy)</h2>
<p><small>By Warren D. Smith, Feb 2009; inspired by James Green-Armytage
(whom I will abbreviate "J.G-A.")</small>

<p>
<b>a:</b> is obvious...  voting dishonestly plainly could hurt you but cannot help.
</p>
<p>
<b>b,c,d,e,f,g:</b> The "NES," i.e. "Naive Exaggeration Strategy," suffices to see these
claims in view of standard properties of the normal distibution, and central
limit theorem.  Specifically, NES(X) means that the voters who prefer X&gt;W
change their vote by demoting W to last-ranked and promoting X to top-ranked, and 
otherwise leaving their ballots unaltered. Here W is the honest-votes winner.
"NES" means NES(X) with whichever X causes it to work 
(i.e. succeed in changing the winner from W to X)
if any X works.  If no X&ne;W works we say NES "failed."
It is not hard to argue NES(X) will work with probability&rarr;1 in all of these
voting methods (for at least one X).
</p>
<p>
I don't want to give full details but will sketch a few cases.
With plurality voting, all the N candidates have vote totals V/N
<i>equal</i> to within relative error &plusmn;&epsilon; for any fixed
&epsilon;&gt;0 (with probability&rarr;1 when V&rarr;&infin; with N held fixed) 
and then NES(X) strategy will cause X to win
(for any X&ne;W) with probability&rarr;1.
</p><p>
With AntiPlurality and Coombs voting, NES(X) strategy will cause X to win 
(with probability&rarr;1) <i>provided</i> X is
the candidate who would have won if all ballots ranking W bottom, magically vanished.
</p><p>
For median-based range voting, all N medians will be equal to within &plusmn;&epsilon;
for any fixed
&epsilon;&gt;0 (with probability&rarr;1 when V&rarr;&infin; with N held fixed).
NES(X) strategy will raise X's and lower W's median by amounts of order 1/(N-1),
which of course is much greater than arbitrarily small &epsilon;
(with probability&rarr;1 when V&rarr;&infin; with N held fixed).
</p><p>
An argument about strategy in Schulze-beatpaths voting may be found in my 
<a href="ROEstrat.html">paper</a>.
</p><p>
<b>h,i:</b> 
One reason 
the strategy vulnerability probability goes to 1 when N&rarr;&infin; for IRV is
the Quas-Smith theorem <a href="Monotone.html#manycand">here</a>.
</p><p>
The "NES," i.e. "Naive Exaggeration Strategy" suffices to prove lower
bounds above 0 on strategy-vulnerability probability, but now does not yield 100%.
Specifically we find for IRV that
the election is (with probability&rarr;1) vulnerable to NES(X) strategy if 
X defeats W pairwise with honest votes, i.e. NES works <i>if
W is not a Condorcet winner.</i>  (But if W was a Condorcet winner, then with
probability&rarr;1
W will defeat X
in the final IRV round.)
This happens (and does not happen) both with some nonzero constant probabilities when N=3.
(And also when N=4,5,6,... but different constants for each value of N; see
<A href="PuzzlePage.html#p102">puzzle 102</a>
for their values and the fact that when N&rarr;&infin; the probability&rarr;1 that
no Condorcet winner exists.)
</p><p>
For WBS-IRV and BTR-IRV:
the election is (with probability&rarr;1) vulnerable to NES(X) strategy if 
X defeats W pairwise with honest votes, i.e. NES works if
W had not been a Condorcet winner.  
NES(X) strategy may stop W from being a Condorcet winner
even though it had been one with honest votes; but in that case X will not be a Condorcet Winner
after NES(X) strategy (since it still loses pairwise to W) and hence X
may or may not win
the new election (it won't if W survives to the final round).   Hence the limit 
strategy-vulnerability probabilities of BTR-IRV and WBS-IRV are <i>lower bounded</i> by their limit
values for plain IRV, thus proving the "superiority" (or at least equality)
of WBS-IRV and/or BTR-IRV over plain IRV.
</p><p>
The fact that limit-values exist is a consequence of the 
abstract theory of Schl&auml;fli functions which indeed in 
principle allows expressing them (at least for small N) in closed form.
The fact that they are bounded above 0 has
already been discussed.  Indeed, the upper bound on the <i>in</i>vulnerability probability
for IRV is precisely the product
of P(N), i.e. the probability that a Condorcet winner exists among N candidates
(computed in <a href="PuzzCondProb.html">this puzzle</a>), 
times the conditional probability the IRV and Condorcet winners agree conditioned
on the CW existing &ndash; which has been evaluated numerically
in <a href="RandElect.html#cwirv">table 14 here</a>.
The result is:
</p>
<center>
lim<sub>V&rarr;&infin;</sub>prob(IRV <i>not</i> vuln to NES strategy) =
100%, 88%, 77%, 67%, 60%, 54%, 49%, 44%
<br>
for 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 candidates respectively, accurate to about &plusmn;1%.
</center>
<p>
James Green-Armytage claims, using a new mathematical-programming formulation 
(building on 1980s work of J.R.Chamberlin) and a
computer, to have computed
the probability, in 999-voter random elections, that <i>any</I> voter subset can use
<i>any</i> strategy to change the IRV winner in a way that they (unanimously) consider to be
an improvement.   (Note, this is <i>not</i> just the NES subclass of strategies, it's
<i>all</I> strategies.)
He computed IRV's vulnerability-to-strategy probabilities as
16%, 33%, and 49% for the 3, 4 and
5-candidate cases, respectively. 
[And these indeed are greater than our NES-based lower bounds 12%, 23%, 33%,
as they should be, and indeed appear to be rising toward 100%, as the theorem says they must.]
</p><p>
It would be interesting to know what J.G-A.'s computer says about WBS-IRV and BTR-IRV???
</p><p>
<small>
<b>Remark:</b>
It seems if you want an elimination method to have good chances of
immunity to NES-type strategy, then eliminations must be based on
<i>top-rank</i> votes only; if they also involve any other rank, then you get
vulnerability to NES with probability&rarr;100%. So IRV and
methods like it such as WBS-IRV seem singled out by
this criterion.
</small>
</p>
<p>
To upperbound 
the vulnerable-to-strategy limit-probabilities below 1, 
we need to find a positive-probability subclass of elections which are immune to
strategy.   I can do that for IRV 3-candidate elections as follows.
We showed vulnerability to NES strategy 12% of the time.  The only other kind
of strategy one could imagine in a 3-candidate election would be in
<a href="Monotone.html">non-monotone</a> IRV elections &ndash; but these are
only 14.7% of random-model elections. Hence we get vulnerability to <i>any</I> strategy at most
28% of the time (28=14.7+12+safety margin) for IRV 3-candidate elections. 
[Note this also is obeyed
by J.G-A's numerical finding of 16%.]
One could also use an analogous approach to prove lower bounds below 1 for various other election
methods such as WBS-IRV and BTR-IRV (and also perhaps for N=4 or N=5 candidates too).
</p>
<p>
<small>
J.G-A. also notes that "most other methods" (besides IRV) 
exhibit strategy-vulnerability
chances near 100%.  This computer result also confirms our theoretical results.
</small>
<p>
<b>j:</b>
One may also show positive lower bounds on the 
vulnerable-to-strategy limit-probabilities from
the quantitative <a href="GibbSat.html">Gibbard</a>-Satterthwaite theorem by
Ehud Friedgut, Gil Kalai, and Noam Nisan 2008
<a href="assets/documents/mani-focs.pdf">(pdf of their paper)</a>;
this works for a very wide class of election methods.

<b>k: Criticism of the "vulnerability to strategy" probability as a yardstick for 
comparing voting systems:</b> 
What matters to civilization
is <i>not</i> the probability that some voter-subset <i>could</i> strategize;
what matters is the <i>expected utility-decrease</i> caused by the <i>net</I> effect of
<i>all</i> strategic behaviors undertaken by all classes of voters.  Some of these
strategic moves will reinforce, whereas others will "cancel out."
Certainly it is utterly unrealistic to pretend the pessimal voter subset colludes based on
perfect information about the noncolluders &ndash;
while all other voters (not in that subset) forswear all strategy!  And it is also
utterly ludicrous to pretend all strategy-caused winner-changes are "equally bad!"
</p><p>
(In short, the right yardstick for measuring vulnerability to strategy, as well
as lots of other things too, instead is <a href="BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a>.)
</p><p>
Also the "random election model" itself is subject to criticism since it is not
very realistic.
</p>
<p>
If strategic voters have to act on <i>imperfect</I> information, the situation also
changes.  For one thing, they might try a strategy which <i>fails</I> 
to work out for them, but still causes damage &ndash; and such damage ought to be counted,
not ignored.
</P>

<b>Example I (Range superior to IRV under a different definition of "vulnerability to strategy"):
</b>
I have argued elsewhere that if <i>all</i>  the voters know is that
"in IRV elections third party candidates are historically very unlikely to win"
(and as of 2009 this has historically been true in every IRV country, e.g. as of 2009
Australia  has zero third-party members in
its IRV-elected house)
then they would seem justified in "favorite betrayal" for
third-party
candidates <i>100%</I> of the time!
The argument is that that candidate is very unlikely
(well below 1%) to be able to win 
(regardless of how they strategize), in which case such betrayals cost nothing.
However, random-model IRV elections in about 20% of 3-candidate cases have the
property that the votes for the 3rd-party candidate top, cause the "greater evil" to win
(if they'd betrayed him, the lesser evil would have won).
In that case the betrayal gains the voter something.
</p><p>
So in this <i>other</I> sense, IRV elections have 100% probability of "vulnerability
to strategy"
whereas range-voting elections are entirely immune to favorite-betrayal!
</p>
<p>
<b>Example II (Condorcet superior to IRV under a different 
probability model &ndash; 1D politics):</b>
In a different model, namely "one dimensional politics (singlepeaked utility
functions for candidates lying along a line)
3-candidate elections" IRV is fairly likely to fail to elect a centrist
Condorcet winner &ndash; indeed 
<a href="IrvPathologySurvey.html#1D">here</a>
is a model in which this failure-probability is 1/3 &ndash;
and in
every such situation is "vulnerable to strategy" because the losing
extremist-faction
can betray their favorite to elect the centrist.
</p><P>
But meanwhile for Condorcet methods:
a Condorcet winner always exists in 1D politics in this model, neglecting ties
(<a href="BlackSingle.html">Duncan Black's singlepeakedness theorem</a>) 
and Condorcet methods are always <i>in</i>vulnerable to strategy 
in 3-candidate 1D-politics elections.
</p><p>
<small>
<b>Proof sketch:</b>
If the CW is the centrist, then if either extremist faction strategically buries
the centrist, it'd make the wrong extremist win or cause no change.
If the CW is an extremist, then he automatically is a majority-top winner
and so if the centrist faction artificially buries him 
(the other extremist faction already is ranking him bottom)
it won't matter. <b>Q.E.D.</b>
</small>
</p>
<p>
So Condorcet methods are actually <i>optimal</i> within this puzzle's 
"vulnerability to strategy" definition &ndash; <i>zero</I> probability of
"vulnerability to strategy" &ndash;
in 3-candidate 1D-politics elections, while IRV is nonoptimal!  
That's exactly the opposite of JGA's conclusion in
a different probabilistic model.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example III (Range superior to IRV under a different model &ndash; 1D politics &ndash; and 
a different definition):</b>
As we saw <a href="AppCW.html">here</a> range voting with strategic voters will tend to 
yield honest-voter Condorcet winners (and do so more often than IRV).  Hence 
in the 1D politics model in example II, we could argue range voting too is "superior" to
IRV.
