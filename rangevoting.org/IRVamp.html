<H2> Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) "amplification" a.k.a. "chaos" scenarios </H2>

<p>
This 2025-voter 12-candidate <a href="rangeVirv.html">IRV</a>
election is won unambiguously by "A" despite the fact that only
2 voters consider A their favorite.
(For simplicity we have only shown the top or top-two choices by each voter.)

<p>
This election demonstrates an "exponential chain of amplifications."
Using this sort of idea you can make IRV do practically anything.
Notice how <i>every</i> round of this IRV election is 1 vote away from being a tie,
and if that tie had gone the other way then A would <i>not</i> have won. That
illustrates the potential of IRV for generating complete "chad counting" near-tie
election nightmares, where every round can be a near-tie, and every round &ndash; even
those between apparently "unimportant" candidates with "no hope" &ndash; can affect
the ultimate outcome.
</p>

<a name="bad"></a>
<p>
The above example was not intended to make IRV look bad, but merely to demonstrate this
exponential chain phenomenon.  A defender of IRV could justifiably argue that since
A was the second choice of a majority of the voters, A was not a bad winner.
</p><p>
A modification which <i>is</i> intended to make IRV look bad is
<b>below</b>.  Now <b>A wins</b> despite only having two voters (perhaps A and A's spouse?) with 
favorite A, <i>and</i> despite the fact A is ranked either <i>bottommost</i> or second-worst
by 75% of the voters, and A is rated in the bottom-half of all candidates, i.e.
worse than the average random winner-choice selected by a monkey, 
in the view of 98.4% of the voters.
Indeed, A would lose pairwise to <i>every</i> opponent other than Z &ndash; all 10 of them &ndash;
and by a huge "landslide" margin (75-25 or larger) in each case.
</p><blockquote>
"FairVote," the IRV propaganda group, refers to this as "A is a majority winner."
FairVote informed me that because
they have their own special private definition of the term "majority winner,"
this was not a "lie," it was merely a "legitimate difference of opinion."
</blockquote><p>
Probably the best winner in this scenario would be P (rated top or second-top by 75% of
the voters, beats every opponent pairwise by 75-25 or larger "landslide" ratio,
except for Z whom P only beats by 51-49 ratio). 
But IRV never awards P any transfers and hence never regards P as a serious contender;
the only two serious contenders are A and Z.  Actually in this situation if
forced to choose between A and Z, I would probably pick Z because of strength-of-preference,
but IRV always ignores preference-strength information.
So in this example IRV is electing the candidate A
who objectively is probably the worst
of the 12.

While, of course, this <i>particular</i> maximally-dramatic
scenario is unlikely to arise, 
this kind of "amplification" <i>phenomenon</i> is <i>not</i>
terribly unlikely; in fact it is commonplace.  Authors such as Dummett and
Saari have called this "chaos."
</p><p>
To dramatize things in another way, we now fill in the top <i>five</i>
voter preferences (not merely the top two)
in the first example:

<p>
In this "nightmare" IRV election, the "no hopers" based on their top-rank vote counts would
seem to be A,Y,X,W, and V, who <i>combined</i> own less than 1% of the vote.
The lowest of the low would seem to be A, X, and Y.
Meanwhile the "top dog" would appear to be Z with 49.4% of the vote.
However, 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A wins the election.  
</li><li>
But if two more voters came and voted for Y, then Y would win.
</li><li>
On the other hand, if the two extra voters went for  X, then X would win.
</li><li>
On the third hand, if W got the two extra votes, then W would win.
</li><li>
But if V (or U, or T, or S, or R, or Q, or P) had the two extra votes, then Z would win.
</li><li>
But even if Z were granted 20 more votes, then Z still would not win!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Can you imagine the lawsuits?
